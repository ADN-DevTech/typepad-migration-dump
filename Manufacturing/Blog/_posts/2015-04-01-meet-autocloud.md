<p>For many years <strong>Autodesk</strong> has been one of the most prominent CAD software companies in the world. It’s most famous for, sometimes even&#0160;its name is mistaken for it too, <strong>AutoCAD</strong>&#0160;- a 3D CAD software product that came to life back in the eighties.</p>
<p>Since then <strong>Autodesk</strong>&#0160;has&#0160;introduced many other new 3D CAD products like <strong>Inventor</strong>, <strong>Revit</strong>, etc, all written for the desktop environment.</p>
<p>However, for quite a few years now <strong>Autodesk</strong> has been investing heavily in the cloud, creating products like <strong>Fusion 360</strong>,&#0160;<strong>PLM 360</strong>, <strong>AutoCAD 360</strong>, and web services for&#0160;<strong>Rendering</strong>, <strong>Analysis</strong>, yet still mainly thought of as a desktop software company.</p>
<p>In order to change people&#39;s perception and emphasize the company&#39;s commitment to the cloud, <strong>Autodesk</strong> has decided to change its name to <strong>AutoCloud</strong>: <br /> <a class="asset-img-link" href="http://a1.typepad.com/6a0112791b8fe628a401bb0813e1a1970d-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Autodesk-autocloud" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0112791b8fe628a401bb0813e1a1970d img-responsive" src="/assets/image_abd449.jpg" title="Autodesk-autocloud" /></a><br />This might come as a surprise knowing that the company has just changed its logo&#0160;fairly recently, but after careful consideration the decision has been&#0160;approved.</p>
<p>To make sure that all cloud products project this new&#0160;<strong>AutoCloud</strong> image, they will follow&#0160;a new and&#0160;consistent naming.&#0160;The new product names will include&#0160;<strong>FusionCloud 360</strong>, <strong>PLMCloud 360</strong>, <strong>AutoCADCloud 360</strong> and so on.&#0160;</p>
<p><strong>AutoCloud</strong> CEO, <strong>Cloud Bass</strong>, considers this a very important step in the right direction.&#0160;</p>
