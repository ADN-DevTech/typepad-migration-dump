<p><strong>Issue:</strong></p>  <p>I am using Inventor ETO and the property grid and immediate window in the Intent model browser are not available. </p>  <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>  <p>This behavior has been reported to engineering however reproducible steps to recreate the behavior have not been found. The fix is to reset the browser by holding SHIFT and clicking Options, then say Yes to the next dialog.</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p><a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/.a/6a0167607c2431970b0167672b3091970b-pi"><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="clip_image002" border="0" alt="clip_image002" src="/assets/image_c22539.jpg" width="411" height="318" /></a></p>
