<p>By <a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/manufacturing/wayne-brill.html" target="_self">Wayne Brill</a></p>  <p>Inventor 2014 installs the .NET Framework 4.5. The first shipping release of Vault 2013 does not get along well with the 4.5 version. On my development system, after I installed Inventor 2014, the files in the Project Explorer pane in Vault Explorer did not display. Also Vault Explorer would crash when I right clicked a folder and selected “Get / Check out”. The solution was to install the <a href="http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/ps/dl/item?siteID=123112&amp;id=21017345&amp;linkID=9261341" target="_blank">Vault 2013 Service Pack</a></p>
