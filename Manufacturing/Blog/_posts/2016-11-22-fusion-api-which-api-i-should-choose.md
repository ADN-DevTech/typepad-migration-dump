<p>By <a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/manufacturing/xiaodong-liang.html" target="_self">Xiaodong Liang</a></p>  <p>Fusion API provides 3 types of languages: Python, JavaScript and C++. I found an interesting discussion on <a href="http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/api-and-scripts/c-javascript-or-python/td-p/6535789">Fusion API forum</a>, where our API designer <a href="http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/116141">Brian Ekins</a> gave an answer on the specifics of each language. To make it more searchable on internet, I posted it in the blog. And we could polish it with more information in the future.</p>  <p><a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/.a/6a0167607c2431970b01b7c8b28960970b-pi"><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="/assets/image_ada57e.jpg" width="416" height="322" /></a></p>  <p><em>There are several things to consider when choosing a language.</em></p>  <p><em>As far as the API for each of the languages being developed; functionality is delivered for all three languages at the same time.&#160; Internally, we implement the C++ interface first but then wrappers are constructed automatically for Python and JavaScript.&#160; So all three have the same capabilities.&#160; However, there's one exception to this in that JavaScript doesn't support all of the events.&#160; We ran into a technical problem with events and JavaScript so we've blocked exporting most events in JavaScript.</em></p>  <p><em>For speed of execution, C++ will be the fastest since it is compiled code that runs within the Fusion process.&#160; On Windows and Mac, Python also runs in-process but it's interpreted and Python isn't known as a particularly fast language.&#160; On Windows, JavaScript runs out of process and as a result is much slower.&#160; On Mac, it runs in-process and is similar to Python.</em></p>  <p><em>For speed of development, much depends on which language you have the most experience with already.&#160; A new language always has a learning curve at the beginning.&#160; But assuming that you are comfortable with all three, I would say that Python is probably the language someone could develop code the fastest in.&#160; One reason for this is that you do the development and debugging within the same IDE.&#160; You can also do some prototyping using the text window in Fusion.&#160; C++ has an advantage that it is typed so you're able to catch many problems while writing and compiling, while you end up debugging a lot of problems at run time with the other two languages.</em></p>  <p><em>Another thing to consider is if you plan to deliver your program commercially.&#160; With JavaScript and Python you're essentially delivering your source code.&#160; With C++ you're delivering a binary which is much harder for someone to crack.</em></p>  <p><em>If you don't care about the security of your code, I would recommend Python and if you do need to protect your code then C++.</em></p>  <p>I agree with Brian’s comments. Just one of my practices of Fusion API: I prefer to Python because it is easy to debug and make a quick demo code. </p>
