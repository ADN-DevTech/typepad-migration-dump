<p>You may want to create a pattern that places components at the same place of another pattern. In order to do that you need to get back the first element of the pattern (the one which the pattern is based on).</p>
<p>Let&#39;s say you have a part component in an assembly that has holes in a pattern and you try to place components at the same places. A new pattern feature can be based on an existing one but to get the correct result you would need to have the firts component on the new pattern at the same place as the first component of the original pattern is.</p>
