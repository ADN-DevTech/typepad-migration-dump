<h2>Connecting Autodesk to the Cloud</h2>
<h3>Win up to $5000, a newly released tablet computer and a trip to Las Vegas!</h3>
<p>APPHACK 2.0 is a virtual code-fest to produce apps/plug-ins for: AutoCAD, Revit, Inventor and BIM 360 Glue. The theme of the event is “Connecting Autodesk to the&#0160;Cloud”<strong> –&#0160;and this is open to creative</strong> <strong>interpretation.</strong> Perhaps you can think of a way to wire our software&#0160;into your favorite social media network or make use of infinite cloud computing to carry out&#0160;CPU-intensive tasks. Or maybe you have a way to help users better&#0160;visualize and share their ideas&#0160;using a web browser. Build a standalone app for an AutoCAD, Revit, Inventor or a BIM 360 Glue product. Or build an app that takes advantage of the integration capabilities of BIM 360 Glue with either of the 3 other products&#0160;families: AutoCAD, Revit and Inventor! It’s up to you. Code a new app, finish coding one you already have in progress or submit one you already have but haven’t published yet. </p>
