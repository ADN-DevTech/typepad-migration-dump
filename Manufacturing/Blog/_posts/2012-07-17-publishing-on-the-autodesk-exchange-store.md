<p>I’m pleased to announce that the <a href="http://apps.exchange.autodesk.com" target="_blank">Autodesk Exchange store</a> is now open to all for app submissions. Its taken a while since the store opened to launch this because we were missing some essential backend infrastructure for managing the app submissions. That’s in place now, so its time to open the floodgates. Click on the link below to visit the store.</p>
<p><a href="http://apps.exchange.autodesk.com" target="_blank"><img alt="exchange1" border="0" height="85" src="/assets/image_3d64b3.jpg" style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="exchange1" width="244" /></a></p>
<p>Once you’re in the store of your choice, sign in using your Autodesk Single-Sign-On account and click on the ‘publisher’ link to start submitting your app:</p>
<p><a href="http://apps.exchange.autodesk.com/Publisher/Description" target="_blank"><img alt="image001" border="0" height="106" src="/assets/image_e21e40.jpg" style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="image001" width="244" /></a></p>
<p>But please read the requirements and guidelines we’ll be posting to DevBlog following this post before you submit your apps. We’ll be updating the <a href="http://www.autodesk.com/developapps" target="_blank">Exchange Developer Center</a> with the same information in due course, but that will take a few days. Once they’re posted, we’ll be keeping the Developer Center versions of this information up to date, so please use those in preference to the information posted here.</p>
<p><a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/manufacturing/2012/07/autodesk-exchange-apps-summary-information.html" target="_self">Here&#39;s a link</a> to the post summarizing all the posted information.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE 7/30/12: </strong></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.autodesk.com/developapps" target="_blank">Exchange Developer Center</a> has now been updated with this information. From now on, please go there for the most up to date version of this information.</p>
