<p>By <a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/manufacturing/xiaodong-liang.html" target="_self">Xiaodong Liang</a></p>  <p><strong></strong></p>  <p><strong>Issue</strong></p>  <p>When importing step file into Inventor programmatically,&#160; sometimes we get HTML pages popping up with issues. Is the any way either programmatically or otherwise to stop these HTM reports appearing ?</p>  <p><strong>Solution</strong>     <br />During data translation, Inventor will create a Translation Report to record some translation information, and it’s embedded into the opened file, as following. If there is error during the translation, the report will pop up automatically to remind user of the error. If there is any error in the translation, the translation report (I mean “error report”.) will always pop up, and technically we don’t have any method to block it directly, but have workarounds.</p>  <p><a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/.a/6a0167607c2431970b016769179613970b-pi"><img style="border-right-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" title="clip_image002" border="0" alt="clip_image002" src="/assets/image_ddfca0.jpg" width="369" height="332" /></a></p>  <p>To solve this issue, the only way is to forbid Inventor embedding the translation report, and the behavior is as following snapshot. (<b>Reminder</b> here: if use our workarounds, users are not able to see the report anymore unless roll back. So make sure the customer be aware of this risk.)</p>  <p><a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/.a/6a0167607c2431970b016769179628970b-pi"><img style="border-right-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" title="clip_image002[5]" border="0" alt="clip_image002[5]" src="/assets/image_a6d651.jpg" width="374" height="235" /></a></p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>1. For Inventor 2009 SP2, Inventor 2010 and its SPs, the user can add an Environment Variable “TRANS_REPORT_OPTION” and set it to 2, and then restart Inventor. (If the user wants to get the report again, just delete the variable and restart Inventor.)</p>  <p><a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/.a/6a0167607c2431970b017743f2c96f970d-pi"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="clip_image002[7]" border="0" alt="clip_image002[7]" src="/assets/image_12282b.jpg" width="378" height="434" /></a></p>  <p>2. On Inventor 2010 Subscription build and above versions, the users can use the option to control it directly:&#160; “<strong>EmbedInDocument</strong>”=false. </p>
