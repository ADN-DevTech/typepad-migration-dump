<p>You might have heard by now of the biggest ever Autodesk Developer Conference coming this June, <a href="http://forge.autodesk.com/conference/">Forge DevCon</a></p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://modthemachine.typepad.com/.a/6a00e553fcbfc6883401bb08d6c7b3970d-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false" style="display: inline;"><img alt="ForgeDevCon" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00e553fcbfc6883401bb08d6c7b3970d img-responsive" src="/assets/image_fd7d20.jpg" title="ForgeDevCon" /></a></p>
<p>The <strong>Early Bird tickets</strong> are running out <strong>this Friday</strong>, so you&#39;ll have to hurry up if you want to use them! :)</p>
<p>At the conference&#0160;you can learn everything there is to know about our <a href="http://forge.autodesk.com/platform/">Forge Platform</a> and how you can build on top of it.</p>
<p>Brian will be there to talk about <strong>Fusion API</strong>, and I will be there too explaining how&#0160;you will be able to take advantage of our translation services to get data out of pretty much any design file you have.</p>
<p>There will be many tracks with great topics: <a href="http://forge.autodesk.com/tracks-and-speakers/">http://forge.autodesk.com/tracks-and-speakers/</a>&#0160;</p>
<p>The same week we&#39;ll also have our 2nd <strong>3d Web Fest</strong>:&#0160;<a href="http://www.3dwebfest.com">http://www.3dwebfest.com</a></p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://modthemachine.typepad.com/.a/6a00e553fcbfc6883401b8d1bcbcf7970c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false" style="display: inline;"><img alt="3dWebFest" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00e553fcbfc6883401b8d1bcbcf7970c img-responsive" src="/assets/image_9bbf32.jpg" title="3dWebFest" /></a></p>
<p>Then the following week we&#39;ll also hold a <a href="http://autodeskcloudaccelerator.com/">Cloud Accelerator</a>, a program that we have run many times by now all around the world with great success. Here we work side-by-side with 3rd party developers to jump start their development on our cloud technologies.</p>
<p>It&#39;s looking to be a great couple of weeks that nobody should miss :)&#0160;</p>
