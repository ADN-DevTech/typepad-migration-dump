<p>Quick reminder …</p>
<p>Time is running out to <a href="http://au.autodesk.com/?nd=slv2012_call_for_proposals" target="_blank">submit your class proposals for Autodesk University 2012</a>. The deadline is May 22nd – next Tuesday. <strong>We&#39;re particularly keen to be able to schedule more Inventor API classes than last year.</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/autocad/2012/04/devcamps.html">AEC and <strong>Manufacturing </strong>DevCamps</a> are close now too. AEC is June 6-7, and Manufacturing is June 13-14. Each is followed by a one-day DevLab workshop.</p>
