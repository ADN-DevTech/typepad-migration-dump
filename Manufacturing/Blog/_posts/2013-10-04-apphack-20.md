<h5><font style="font-weight: bold">Win up to $5000, a newly released tablet computer and a trip to Las Vegas!</font></h5>  <p>APPHACK 2.0 is a virtual code-fest to produce apps/plug-ins for: AutoCAD, Revit, Inventor and BIM 360 Glue. The theme of the event is “Connecting Autodesk to the Cloud”<b> – and this is open to creative</b> <b>interpretation.</b> Perhaps you can think of a way to wire our software into your favorite social media network or make use of infinite cloud computing to carry out CPU-intensive tasks. Or maybe you have a way to help users better visualize and share their ideas using a web browser. Build a standalone app for an AutoCAD, Revit, Inventor or a BIM 360 Glue product. Or build an app that takes advantage of the integration capabilities of BIM 360 Glue with either of the 3 other products families: AutoCAD, Revit and Inventor! It’s up to you. Code a new app, finish coding one you already have in progress or submit one you already have but haven’t published yet. </p>  <p>Please note that the competition is open to ADN members and US residents only. This is expanded from last year which was open to ADN members only. Also, last year it was for AutoCAD only and this year covers AutoCAD, Revit, Inventor and BIM360Glue.</p>  <p>Find out more about the event here:</p>  <p><a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/autocad/announcing-apphack-20.html">http://adndevblog.typepad.com/autocad/announcing-apphack-20.html</a></p>
