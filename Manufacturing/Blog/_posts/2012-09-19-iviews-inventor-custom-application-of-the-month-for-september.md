<p>By <a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/manufacturing/wayne-brill.html" target="_self">Wayne Brill</a></p>  <p>One of the Inventor custom applications on the <a href="http://apps.exchange.autodesk.com/INVNTOR/Home/Index" target="_blank">Autodesk Exchange store</a> was featured as the product of the month for September on the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/adskinventor" target="_blank">Autodesk Inventor facebook page</a>. The video demonstrating the application will quickly show you the enhancements the AddIn provides for drawing views. </p>  <p><a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/.a/6a0167607c2431970b017c31fc40bc970b-pi"><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="image_thumb[1]" border="0" alt="image_thumb[1]" src="/assets/image_a39afb.jpg" width="449" height="423" /></a></p>  <p>This type of promotion is a great thing for custom application developer’s and the exchange store is one of the best ways to let potential customers know about your company and your applications. For more information on how to get your application on the exchange store see this <a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/manufacturing/2012/07/publishing-on-the-autodesk-exchange-store.html" target="_blank">post</a> on this blog.&#160; </p>  <p>I installed this application and found it very easy to use and I can see how this could save a lot of time by allow you to easily change the size and scale of drawing views.</p>
