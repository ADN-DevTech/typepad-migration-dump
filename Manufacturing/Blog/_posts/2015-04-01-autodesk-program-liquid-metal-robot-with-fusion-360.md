<p>By <a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/manufacturing/xiaodong-liang.html" target="_self">Xiaodong Liang</a></p>  <p>Last June, Autodesk successfully launched <a href="http://spark.autodesk.com/">Spark</a>, a milestone program to extend its industry network via 3D printer. Ten months later, Autodesk announced <strong>Liquid Metal Robot Program</strong> that makes a further step to couple Fusion 360 with the newest science: <a href="http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/2402042/chinese-scientists-create-liquid-metal-machines-that-eat-aluminium-for-power">liquid metal machine</a>. </p>  <p>What is this science? quoted from the <a href="http://zeenews.india.com/news/sci-tech/worlds-first-self-propelled-liquid-metal-robot-that-can-power-itself_1570812.html">article</a>:<em> soft machine looks rather intelligent and can deform itself according to the space it voyages in, just like the Terminator does from the science-fiction film and these unusual behaviors perfectly resemble the living organisms in nature.</em></p>  <p>This got the attention of Autodesk. The program is to <a name="OLE_LINK3"></a>fund the engineers of data acquisition to produce the box to capture the behaviors of liquid metal and then present them in Fusion 360. It is valuable to analyze liquid metal in a simulation environment and set the reasonable behaviors back to the metal that our human need. </p>  <p>As well known, Fusion 360 has amazing abilities of free forming, animation and manufacture. The API was almost one year young, yet well born a match for this program.</p>  <table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2" width="400" border="0"><tbody>     <tr>       <td valign="top" width="400"><a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/.a/6a0167607c2431970b01b7c7700cd6970b-pi"><img title="image" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px" border="0" alt="image" src="/assets/image_c3b9f8.jpg" width="225" height="504" /></a></td>     </tr>   </tbody></table>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>Can you imagine? It is really a rocketing era. One of Autodesk partners has already brought forward an initial prototype of such box that starts to work. I am honored to be the first to interview him just this afternoon. Sorry that I cannot tell who he is. I am limited in the non-disclosure agreement. This engineer told me he truly believes in “stay foolish, stay hungry”. Yet I managed to capture a short video on-site.</p>  <p><a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/.a/6a0167607c2431970b01bb081405ed970d-pi"><img title="Untitled1" style="display: inline" alt="Untitled1" src="/assets/image_71ea67.jpg" width="447" height="335" /></a></p>  <p>Although it still needs some enhancements to seize more instant and precise data, it has proved a promising future of the application. It also shows Fusion 360 API is robust.</p>  <p>If you are interested in the Liquid Metal Robot program, please click <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_Fools%27_Day">here</a> for more details.</p>
