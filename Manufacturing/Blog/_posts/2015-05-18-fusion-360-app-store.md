<p>The&#0160;<a href="https://apps.exchange.autodesk.com/FUSION/en/Home/Index" target="_self"><strong>Fusion 360 App Store</strong></a>&#0160;now has apps using the new&#0160;<strong>APIs</strong>&#0160;as well and yours could be among them too ;)</p>
<p>At the moment there is only&#0160;<strong>Python</strong>&#0160;and&#0160;<strong>JavaScript</strong>&#0160;<strong>API</strong>&#0160;available, which do not really provide&#0160;<strong>IP</strong>&#0160;protection. However, it is perfect if you just want to provide some free utilities or want to hook up the app to a web service which provides the main functionality for the user.</p>
<p>It&#39;s already a good time to play around with the&#0160;<strong>API</strong>&#0160;to see what&#39;s available, how things work. So by the time the&#0160;<strong>C++</strong>&#0160;<strong>API</strong>&#0160;becomes available you are already familiar with the basics. The best place to get started is probably here: <a href="http://autodesk.com/developfusion" target="_self" title="">http://autodesk.com/developfusion</a>&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>Have fun! :)&#0160;</p>
