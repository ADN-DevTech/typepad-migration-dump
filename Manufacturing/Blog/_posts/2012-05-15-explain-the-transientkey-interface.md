<p><strong>Issue</strong></p>
<p>Looking at the Inventor COM interfaces generated by #import, I found TransientKey. What is it?</p>
<p><a name="section2"></a></p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
<p>The transient keys are useful to applications that want to work on their own copy of the BODY e.g. FEA apps, Viewers etc. <br />Most of thes FEA applications work by <br />&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; a. extracting the BODY for an Inventor part as a SAT file <br />&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; b. constructing their own copy of the BODY <br />&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; c. interpreting the PID attributes attached on the BODY to obtain transient keys <br />&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; d. correlating the objects in their copy of the BODY with that of Inventor using BindTransientKeyToObject&#0160; <br />Viewers also use the transient keys for efficiency reasons, however they use a different mechanism to extract the information using Inventor&#39;s BRep API. <br />Note that these keys are valid only during one session. Even within that session they are valid only as long as the surface body does not change.</p>
