<p>By&nbsp;<a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/manufacturing/adam-nagy.html" target="_self">Adam Nagy</a></p>
<p>As <a href="http://modthemachine.typepad.com/my_weblog/about-the-author.html" target="_self">Brian</a>&nbsp;mentioned it <a href="http://modthemachine.typepad.com/my_weblog/2015/07/c-is-here-for-fusion.html" target="_self">here</a>, the latest release of <strong>Fusion 360</strong>&nbsp;has a <strong>C++ API</strong> as well. This has been much awaited by developers who want to protect their <strong>Intellectual Property</strong> (IP). Your code in case of scripting languages is easily accessible, but the <strong>C++</strong> code will be compiled so you only need to distribute your code in binary format, which is much more secure.<br />Note: the <strong>Mac App Store</strong> (MAS) version of the latest&nbsp;<strong>Fusion</strong>&nbsp;release is not available just yet, but is coming real soon</p>
<p>Having reached this milestone with the introduction of the <strong>C++ API</strong>, we are planning to organise an online&nbsp;<strong>Fusion Hackathon</strong>&nbsp;round September - October, running for about a month or so. As part of that we'll deliver presentations to help you get started with <strong>Fusion</strong> app development and will be there to answer your questions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you need an incentive to take part in the hackathon then here is one: we are thinking of giving a reward of up to <strong>$500</strong>&nbsp;to each of you for a finished submitted application that you develop by the end of the hackathon and is published in <a href="https://apps.exchange.autodesk.com/FUSION/en/Home/Index" target="_self">Autodesk Exchange Fusion App store</a>.</p>
<p>Watch out for further information concerning the hackathon and start thinking about what you'd like to develop. :)</p>
