<p>I recently posted about the <a href="http://modthemachine.typepad.com/my_weblog/2015/03/fusion-360s-api-webinar.html">Fusion API Webinar</a> and want to correct and clarify a few things I said during the presentation and in the questions after.</p>  <ol>   <li>When showing the slides comparing the JavaScript and Python code I mentioned that JavaScript is pickier about types and sometimes requires type casting.&#160; This is not true.&#160; There was an issue in a very early version of the API where it did require type casting but that was a Fusion API issue and not a JavaScript issue and has long since been addressed.&#160; I’ve updated the PowerPoint slides to remove the casting line.</li>    <li>It was asked if you could begin a debug session into a running JavaScript add-in and replied that I didn’t believe it was possible.&#160; I’ve since learned about a capability that I didn’t know about that does allow you to debug into a running JavaScript add-in or script.&#160; From the <strong>Scripts and Add-Ins</strong> dialog you can see which scripts and add-ins are currently running by looking for the running symbol next to the name as I’ve highlighted below.&#160; When you select a running JavaScript program, the Debug button will be enabled, as shown below.&#160; This will open a window and allow you to begin debugging the running script.      <br />      <br /><a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/.a/6a0167607c2431970b01b7c76f5f00970b-pi"><img title="EditJavaScript" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px" border="0" alt="EditJavaScript" src="/assets/image_4a3f33.jpg" width="420" height="342" /></a>      <br /></li>    <li>I also mentioned TkInter as a way to create custom dialogs when using Python but that there are currently problems when using it on a Mac.&#160; This is true but I want to clarify that it’s not a Fusion 360 API issue in this case but is a <a href="https://www.python.org/download/mac/tcltk/">general problem with TkInter (Tcl/Tk specifically) on Mac</a>.&#160; We’ve attempted to find a combination of libraries that works but so far have been unsuccessful.</li> </ol>    <p>-Brian</p>
