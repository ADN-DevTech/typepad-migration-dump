<p>By <a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/manufacturing/sajith-subramanian.html" target="_self">Sajith Subramanian</a></p><p>The earlier Vault Browser + Forge sample by Wayne has now been updated. (Link to Wayne’s sample: <a href="https://github.com/Wayne-Brill/VaultBrowserSample_Forge_Demo">https://github.com/Wayne-Brill/VaultBrowserSample_Forge_Demo</a>).<p>Please find the link to the newer solution here: <a href="https://github.com/sajith-subramanian/VaultBrowser_Forge_Sample">https://github.com/sajith-subramanian/VaultBrowser_Forge_Sample</a>.<p>Some key highlights of this updated sample are as listed below:<ol><li>This example does a read only sign-in into Vault, hence does not consume a Vault License.<li>Is not really based off the Vault Browser sample provided in the SDK, contains lesser code.<li>No longer uses Apprentice Server, so no need to have Inventor View / Inventor installed.</li></li></li></ol><p>In order to use this sample you would need Autodesk developer credentials. Visit the <a href="https://developer.autodesk.com/">Forge Developer Portal</a>, sign up for an account, then <a href="https://developer.autodesk.com/myapps/create">create an app</a>.</p><p>Below is a screencast of how the application works.</p><p><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="320" src="https://screencast.autodesk.com/Embed/Timeline/b04950ce-3c03-4318-86be-3dceaa0fd87a" webkitallowfullscreen="" width="640"></iframe></p></p></p></p>
