<p>Want to get in on the ground floor on the future of mechanical design?&nbsp; <br />Looking for a user base that embraces new ways of doing things?&nbsp; <br />Have you taken a look at <strong>Fusion 360</strong> yet – one of the first <strong>Cloud based</strong> mechanical design tools?&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a once in a decade opportunity to stake out your position in a new market – where you can be the market leader, an opportunity to leapfrog your competition.&nbsp; <br />A small investment made early can lay a foundation for building a large new business long term (but yes you won’t see much of an ROI in the near term). You can get a “quick start” building your first <strong>Fusion 360</strong> app (using <strong>JavaScript</strong>, <strong>Python</strong> or <strong>C++</strong>) by participating in the upcoming <strong>Fusion 360 Hackathon</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Build and publish a <strong>Fusion 360</strong> app in the <a href="https://apps.exchange.autodesk.com/FUSION/en/Home/Index" target="_self"><strong>Autodesk App Store</strong></a> during the <strong>Hackathon</strong> and get yourself a <strong>$500</strong> reward too!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Looking for a simple app to get started with? Get some ideas from the&nbsp;<a href="http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/ideas/v2/ideaexchangepage/blog-id/125/tab/most-kudoed">Fusion 360 IdeaStation</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href="https://apps.exchange.autodesk.com/FUSION/en/Home/Index">Fusion 360 App Store</a>.&nbsp; Also be sure to check out <strong>Autodesk</strong> planned enhancements for <strong>Fusion 360</strong> for the coming year (yes we publish our&nbsp;<a href="http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/fusion-360-product-roadmap/fusion-360-roadmap-second-half-2015/ba-p/5707378">Fusion 360 development roadmap</a>&nbsp;in public for all to see and comment).</p>
