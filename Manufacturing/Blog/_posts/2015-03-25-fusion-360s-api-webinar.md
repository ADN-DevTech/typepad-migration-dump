<p>This morning, here in slightly rainy Oregon, I presented a webinar about the Fusion 360 API.&#160; For those of you that missed it, the entire presentation is now available on YouTube and you can also download the <a href="http://modthemachine.typepad.com/FusionAPI.pptx">PowerPoint slides</a> that I used for the presentation.&#160; </p> <iframe height="259" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/g0xWqLen7gI" frameborder="0" width="460" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>You can learn more about the <a href="http://fusion360.autodesk.com/">Fusion 360</a> product and also install it to get a better understanding of how it works and what it can do. I welcome any comments about the API at the <a href="http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/api-and-scripts/bd-p/22">Fusion 360 API and Scripts forum</a>. </p>  <p>There are also <a href="http://modthemachine.typepad.com/my_weblog/2015/03/correctionsclarification-to-webinar.html">corrections and additional information</a> available about this webinar.</p>  <p>-Brian</p>
