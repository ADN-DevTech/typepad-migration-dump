<p>As of today <strong>Inventor for iPad</strong> is available for download on the Apple App Store. <br />Product testers from various tech magazines gave rave reviews about the product.</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/.a/6a0167607c2431970b017c3836d164970b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Ipad_inventor_image" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0167607c2431970b017c3836d164970b" src="/assets/image_d0e664.jpg" style="width: 450px;" title="Ipad_inventor_image" /></a></p>
<p>Not only does it contain the full functionality of Inventor but more than <strong>100 new cool features</strong> were added, including:<br />-&#0160;<strong>Voice Control</strong>:&#0160;using your voice you can activate&#0160;commands or set parameter values<br />&#0160; - In case of using the App in a public library you can switch to&#0160;<strong>Whisper Mode</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>- <strong>Eye Tracking</strong>: you can manipulate objects simply by looking at points on the screen and blinking&#0160;<br />&#0160; - If you download the App today you&#39;ll also get a <strong>free pack of eye drops</strong>&#0160;</p>
<div>- <strong>Wake Up</strong>: if you stop eye contact with the product, it will start playing random songs from your iTunes library&#0160;
<p>The App also comes with an <strong>Objective-C API</strong> for 3rd party developers, so extending the App&#39;s features should be a piece of cake. <br />
To showcase its power, <strong><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/about-the-author.html" target="_self">Kean Walmsley</a></strong> wrote <strong>Kinect and Leap Motion integration</strong> plug-ins for the App. <br />
They enable you to control the model objects by doing hand gestures in free space. <br />
In case of inappropriate gestures the App terminates immediately and can only be restarted in <strong>Sulking Mode</strong>.</p>
<p>Further information and direct link to the App and the plug-in&#39;s can be found <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_Fools%27_Day" target="_self">here</a>.&#0160;</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
