<p>By&#0160;<a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/autocad/announcing-apphack-20.html">Stephen Preston</a><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/.a/6a0167607c2431970b01b8d093ba27970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Cloud accelerator image" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0167607c2431970b01b8d093ba27970c img-responsive" height="358" src="/assets/image_82d9ab.jpg" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Cloud accelerator image" width="480" /></a><br /><br /><br /></p>
<ul>
<li>Have a great idea for a new product that leverages an Autodesk web service? <br /><br /></li>
<li>Want up close and personal help from Autodesk to turn your idea into a working prototype? &#0160;<br /><br /></li>
<li>Interested in getting face to face with Autodesk Cloud Engineers to both learn and make sure they know what you want?</li>
</ul>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>If yes, the 2015 Autodesk Cloud Accelerator may be for you.<br /><br />Autodesk will be hosting a Cloud Accelerator in our San Francisco office for up to 14 creative software developers for two weeks – March 9 to March 20, 2015. During the Accelerator, participants will work intensively on their chosen project&#0160; with the help, support, and training of the Autodesk Cloud engineering teams.&#0160; This includes daily classes by industry experts on important aspects of Cloud development – and 1 on 1 help from these experts in real time. At the end of the Accelerator, you will also have the opportunity to present your prototype to senior Autodesk Executives. <br /><br />To pursue a place in the Accelerator, send us a proposal (in English) of not more than 1000 words explaining why you should be one of participants and graduates in the “first class”. Proposals should be emailed to <a href="mailto:adn-training-worldwide@autodesk.com" target="_self">adn-training-worldwide@autodesk.com</a> no later than January 10, 2015. Successful candidates will be notified on or around January 17, 2015.<br /><br />How will Autodesk choose who participates in this first Cloud Accelerator class?<br /><br />To get a position in the Accelerator, Autodesk will be looking for the following in your proposal:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use of an Autodesk Web Service API to fill a compelling customer need. (View &amp; Data, AutoCAD® I/O, Autodesk® Fusion 360™, Autodesk® BIM 360™ or Autodesk® ReCap 360™)</li>
<li>Likelihood of having a demonstrable prototype by the end of the Accelerator.</li>
<li>Strong development skills.</li>
<li>High motivation.<br /><br /></li>
</ul>
<p>Too costly for you? &#0160;<br /><br />Autodesk recognizes two weeks of time out of the office, as well as travel and living costs, is a large investment.&#0160; To partially offset these costs, Autodesk will pay lodging costs for all the developers in this first class (14 nights in a hotel).&#0160; Up to 2 people from a single company will be accepted so be clear in your proposal if this is for 1 or 2 people (maybe you want both a product designer and developer to participate?). All other expenses are the responsibility of the participants including airfare and food (though you can be confident Autodesk will be buying a number of lunches and dinners for the class).<br /><br />Questions?<br /><br />Don’t be shy to ask us if you need more information to decide whether to apply.&#0160; We are happy to talk with you about what you are considering developing as part of the Accelerator – or about details you may want to know on Accelerator logistics.</p>
<p>We want to help you make progress developing your own products that use Cloud technologies – whether or not you end up participating in the 2015 Accelerator.&#0160; So we strongly encourage you to be quick to ask us any questions you may have on the Accelerator.&#0160; Send your questions to <br /><a href="mailto:adn-training-worldwide@autodesk.com" target="_self">adn-training-worldwide@autodesk.com</a>.<br /><br /></p>
