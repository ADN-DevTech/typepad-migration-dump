<div>One of his latest projects, the house called <strong>The Future</strong>, will&#0160;showcase -&#0160;among many other things - a 3d printer room, where anyone can turn their fantasies into reality.&#0160;The software and 3d printers will, of course, be provided by <strong>Autodesk</strong>. This is just the first of many collaborative projects between the <a href="http://www.teslamotors.com" target="_self">Tesla</a> driving musician and <strong>Autodesk</strong>.</div>
<div>To strengthen the commitment from <strong>Autodesk&#39;s</strong> side, <strong>Carl Bass</strong>&#0160;awarded <strong>Will</strong> the title of <strong>Honorary Spokesperson for Autodesk</strong>.</div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
<div>The collaboration might also extend to the field of music as <strong>Will</strong> was very imporessed by <strong>Carl</strong>&#39;s <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZvTiF6rJ3A#t=43" target="_self">guitar riffs</a> showcased at&#0160;<strong>Autodesk&#0160;University</strong>&#0160;last year. <br />At the moment, however, we can only speculate.&#0160;</div>
