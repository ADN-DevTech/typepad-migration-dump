<p><strong>DevDays</strong> is getting closer and closer. This time around it won&#39;t be just a one day event but will be combined with&#0160;<strong>DevWeek</strong> where we will help developers create their solutions based on our technologies.</p>
<p>These events are&#0160;<strong>not only</strong> for <strong>ADN</strong> members! Anyone interested in learning about what&#39;s coming in the next release of our products or needs our help with using our <strong>API</strong>&#39;s is welcome to join.</p>
<p>See you there! :)</p>
