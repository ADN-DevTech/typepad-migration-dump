  body: 'Philippe, I''m using this process to start our Inventor 2014 Pro. When I
    use the ''CreateInstanceFromProcess'', it works to start a new process of Inventor2014...
    But I can''t get the handle to that process; the Marshal.GetActiveObject continuously
    fails no matter how long it runs. Then if I use the CreateInstanceFromCLSID...
    I get an error as the System.Type.GetTypeFromProgID("Inventor.Application") fails
    to return a system.type    What exactly is the GetTypeFromProgID looking for in
    the registry? I have an entry for Inventor.Application, but what subkey under
    there is it try to acquire?
