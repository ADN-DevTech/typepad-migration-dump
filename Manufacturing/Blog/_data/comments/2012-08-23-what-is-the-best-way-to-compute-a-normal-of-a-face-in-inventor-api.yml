  body: "For anyone else doing this, a much simpler way to get the normal of a planar\
    \ face is just to get it from the face's \"Plane\" geometry, like so (in VB.NET):\n\
    \nIf TypeOf oFace.Geometry Is Plane Then\n\tDim oFacePlane As Plane = oFace.Geometry\n\
    \tDim oUnitNormal As UnitVector = oFacePlane.Normal\nEnd If\n\nAnd that's it.\
    \ No need to set up Params() or Normals() and call the face's Evaluator or CreateUnitVector\
    \ method."

    I used to do it like that aswell. Sometimes the direction of the normal is inverted
    to that of the actual face when using the geometry property though, so the way
    presented here is the most reliable :)
