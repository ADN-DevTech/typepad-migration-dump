  body: 'Hi Xiaodong Liang,


    I''m looking for a way to add an tooltip to an user definded macro in the drawing
    / annotation ribbon.


    As far as I found out there is no easy way to do this by now.


    Now, when reading your article I wonder if I can modify your code the way that
    my macro button gets an tooltip too?


    As I am just a short time working with Inventor''s VBA I#m not that familiar with
    programming ...


    So Am I right that your code has to be run each time Inventor starts, so that
    the button and its progressive tooltip is inserted at the right position? Or do
    I have to run the sub only once an the ribbons are saved when closing Inventor?
    If so, where are the ribbons saved, so that I can "pack & go" the ribbons to another
    computer.


    Would be great to get some assistance.


    Best regards

    Joe
