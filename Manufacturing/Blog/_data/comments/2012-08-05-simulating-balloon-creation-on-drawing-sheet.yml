  body: "Hello,\nIs there a way to add the balloon from the parts list without actually\
    \ drawing it? Like creating the balloon as from when a user is actually selecting\
    \ from the balloon ribbon on the top?\n\nI am using this piece of code but could\
    \ not figure out the [virtual component as object] part:\n\n  Dim oObjBalloon\
    \ As ObjectCollection\n        oObjBalloon = invApp.TransientObjects.CreateObjectCollection\n\
    \        Call oObjBalloon.Add(oTG.CreatePoint2d(22, 17))\n        Call oObjBalloon.Add(oTG.CreatePoint2d(20,\
    \ 19.3))\n        Dim oBalloon As Balloon\n        oBalloon = SSheet.Balloons.Add(oObjBalloon,\
    \ oPartslist.PartsListRows.Item(1))"
