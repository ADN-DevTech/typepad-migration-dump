  body: 'First of all thanks for a great and very usable piece of code. I have one
    question; if you run this code on a part (oPartDoc = oTopDoc) that consists of
    multible solids it seems as only the first solid is included. How can I modify
    the code to include all the solids in the part file?


    I have used the work-around to put the part into an assembly and then run the
    code.
