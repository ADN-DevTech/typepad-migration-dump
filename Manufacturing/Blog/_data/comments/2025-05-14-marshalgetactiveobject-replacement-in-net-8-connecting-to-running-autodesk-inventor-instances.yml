    For more than one week I invest to find a solution and a workarround.

    May be you are so kind to set uo a small start program with forms and vb, so the
    visual studio solution can be used as "start up scaffolding", consumed by older
    engineers like me'

  body: 'Hi Juergen,


    Thank you for reaching out, and I appreciate your interest in a small Visual Studio
    project setup involving Inventor 2025, iLogic, and a .NET 8 DLL using VB.NET Forms.


    I understand this may be disappointing, but unfortunately, I’m not aware of any
    publicly available solution at this time that fits this exact setup — particularly
    one that includes a simple test.ipt part (e.g., 30x100x125 mm), integrates with
    iLogic, and communicates with a VB.NET DLL for reading and writing iProperties.


    Should such a reference project become available or if there’s an opportunity
    to develop a basic prototype, I’d be happy to keep you informed.


    Thanks again for your message.


    Best regards,

    Chandra Shekar G'

  body: 'Hi Chandra,

    thanks for your kind reply.

    In the meantime I got by your and autodesk help the application running.

    As autodesk excample have small but significant failure, e.g As Property have
    to be As [Property] due related to a set.

    Also to configure Visual Studio with correct references is surly tricky and need
    a well structured tutorial, without no "small" forgotten parts as normally knowing
    by programmer... .

    However, thanks for your good article.

    Kind regards

    Juergen Gross
