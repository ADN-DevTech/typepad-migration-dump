  body: 'Hi,

    I''m starting to develop some macros with VBA. I used your code to know if an
    assembly or part is a Frame and it work fine.

    My problem is after to have duplicate these documents.

    I duplicate documents and replace all file by code and it seem to work fine but
    if I try to modify the model using Frame Generator it reply with an error.


    I need to know how to handle frame generator by code to complete my code, can
    you help me?'
