    You get a complete explanation of some generic sample code to update an assembly,
    and then the difficult stuff, like how to make that executable and link to it
    is as Maxim is asking is completely ignored like its common knowlegde.


    Anyone who is googling about using apprenticeserver in Inventor API can understand
    the sample code. We want to "Use ApprenticeServer API from an Inventor Addin",
    so how do we do that? VB Example?'

    If you are looking to use Apprentice directly within an Inventor process, it is
    not supported. Do take a look at the below link for more details / workarounds.

  body: 'Hi Sajith,


    I have made an addin that exports thumbnail after save document event.

    Problem is that the thumbnail is being created in the background for few seconds
    during this event.


    So I need a separate thread that waits 5 seconds then run apprentice, export thumbnail,
    and close, without making user wait that time.


    Reading the title and first sentences of this blog suggest this is a solution
    to my problem


    "Use ApprenticeServer API from an Inventor Addin


    We can create an ActiveX executable, which references the ApprenticeServer API,
    and which also exposes a suitable API of its own. We can then call into our ActiveX
    executable from an Inventor AddIn dll to request updates to any file references."


    But there is no further explanation how to do that.
