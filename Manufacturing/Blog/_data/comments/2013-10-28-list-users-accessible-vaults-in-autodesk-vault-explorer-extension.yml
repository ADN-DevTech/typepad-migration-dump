    \ to list all the vaults associated with the Administrator account(i.e all the\
    \ vaults) in a check box. I tried \nGroupInfo grpInfo = mgr.AdminService.GetGroupInfoByGroupId(groups.Id);\
    \                  \n                    foreach (var vault in grpInfo.Vaults)\n\
    \                    {\n                        vtemp += vault.Id + \":\" + vault.Name\
    \ + \"\\n\";\n                    }\n\nBut only the first vault is displayed.\
