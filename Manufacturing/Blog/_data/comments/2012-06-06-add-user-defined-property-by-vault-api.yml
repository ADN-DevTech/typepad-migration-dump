  body: 'Can''t get this to work at all. The last call ".AddPropertyDefinition(..."
    returns a soap exception 245 for me.

    Copied your code straight off and added a "test" property that I mapped to an
    IProperty.

    Suggestions?'

    You may be mapping the UDP to a non-custom property, there are several places
    to change in the sample code in order to work in your case, for example: the Moniker,
    Classification etc.

    Add a breakpoint in foreach block after the calling to GetPropertyDefinitionInfosByEntityClassId,
    you will see all information for the PropDefInfo that you can apply.'

  body: 'I get the moniker and display name.


    sometimes I get meaningfully names, e.g:

    Mfg Approved By!{32853F0F-3444-11D1-9E93-0060B03C1CA6}!nvarchar


    But for some properties I get numbers, e.g.:

    14!{D5CDD502-2E9C-101B-9397-08002B2CF9AE}!nvarchar for Manager


    What does "14" mean, I don''t find a property "14" in Inventor?'
