  body: 'Is it possible to do this with a custom table?


    I''m trying to go create a script that updates a reference table to all the drawings
    pointing to the parent assembly, but I can''t seem to find a way to access the
    table without selecting it every time.'

  body: "Hi Tim,\n\nI'm not sure I understand what you meant by \"without selecting\
    \ it every time\".\nYou can access the custom table from Sheet.CustomTables -\
    \ not sure why you would need to select it.\n\nCheers,\nAdam \n-----"
