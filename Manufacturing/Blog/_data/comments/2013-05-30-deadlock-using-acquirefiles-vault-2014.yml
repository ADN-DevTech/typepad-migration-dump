  body: "Hi,\nI had also problems with the GetPropertyValues function from the IPropertyManager.\
    \ I was running this function out from a \nprocess without UI. I realized that\
    \ this function deadlocks in my ConsoleApplication. \nAutodesk.DataManagement.Client.Framework.Library.Initialize(false)\
    \ was solving my problem. \nYou explained, that calling this is not needed \"\
    always\". But could it make problems if I would call it always in my code, \n\
    also if the process has an UI? By testing very fast, I was not able to find any\
    \ side effects when calling Initialize in an UI based application.\n-----"
