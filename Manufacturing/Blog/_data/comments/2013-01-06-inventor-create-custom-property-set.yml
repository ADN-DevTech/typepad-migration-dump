  body: "I realize this is an old post, but what is required to get this code to work\
    \ with Inventor 2019?\n\nI loaded the code into Visual Studio 2017, but errors\
    \ (red, underlined text) were indicated for:\n\n  Inventor.Application\n  Marshal.GetActiveObject\n\
    \  PropertySets\n\nand a few others. I think I am missing the proper References\
    \ required.\n\nI also tried adding this code to an iLogic rule. I corrected the\
    \ errors I could, but I am confident there is an issue with the term, 'Marshal'.\n\
    \nI look forward to any assistance.\n\nRegards,\nJerry\n-----"
