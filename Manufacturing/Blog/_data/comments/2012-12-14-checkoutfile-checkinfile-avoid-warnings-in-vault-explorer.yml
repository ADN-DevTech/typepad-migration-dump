    Its a old post but was vary helpful. I am currently working on Vault 2013. If
    i use the checkout i can only checkout a single file. Its associated/referenced
    files are not checkedout. How can i checkout a file along with its references.


    In Vault 2014 API there is "acquirefiles" which is very helpful.'
