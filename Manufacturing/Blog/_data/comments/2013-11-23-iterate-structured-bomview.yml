    What exact help do you need? You can reach the properties for any of the property
    sets you want.

    Could you please ask this question on the forum instead and clarify what exact
    problem you are running into? It''s much easier to have a discussion there than
    in the comments section here.

    Thank you,

    Adam'

  body: 'Hello,


    Thank you very much for sharing this information. It will be very useful.


    When I prepare my BOMs, I normally sort the "Structured" BOM by Part Number (ascending)
    and then I renumber it. Unfortunately in the API the index of each row Item doesn''t
    follow the sorting and renumbering, therefore the row INDEX usually doesn''t match
    the ITEM NUMBER.


    What I would really like to do is to traverse the entire Structured BOM according
    to the sorting and renumbering that I choose to do. Is there any recommendation
    you can shared with me for getting this accomplished.


    Thank you'
