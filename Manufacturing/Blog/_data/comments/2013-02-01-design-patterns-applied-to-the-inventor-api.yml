  body: 'Hello Philippe,


    I trying to create a small c++ addin for Inventor 2014, for demonstrating a issue
    which we are facing while accessing PartComponentDefinition->Parameters->Count.


    I used the Inventor 2014 SDK wizard for creating the Sample Addin Project.


    The *.manifest file has been copied to the Inventor Addin location in Program
    Data, the *.dll has been copied to the Inventor2014\Bin folder.


    Issue: I able to see the Addin in the Add-In Manager, that is the *.manifest file
    seems to be working pretty fine. but the Addin appear unloaded.


    Can you please suggest anything I might have missed.


    Regards,

    Aditya'

    Your question seems to be unrelated to the topic of that post... In the future
    please log cases on our developer forum instead: <a href="http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/Inventor-Customization/bd-p/120">http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/Inventor-Customization/bd-p/120</a>


    If your add-in appears but is unloaded, it means that it is correctly setup but
    an exception occurs in the Activate method. You need to set a break point in that
    method and work out why it is failing by debugging your code.'

    I have some questions, I have used the previous version of the “Design Patterns
    CP3423” and I want to upgrade my code with the new “Design Patterns CP2675” or
    is there a newer version?


    And what is the best practice how to handle with events in “Design Patterns CP2675”
    I saw there isn’t an Application member any more in the StandardAddInServer.


    Best regards, Marco'

    \ the Application through \"addInSiteObject.Application\". \n\naddInSiteObject\

    The events are working, thanks.


    I have a other question about unload and reload the add-in, if I unload my add-in
    it unload as normal but when I want to reload the add-in again the ribbon won’t
    come back and when I restart Inventor the ribbon load as normal with all the buttons,
    I have test your “Client Graphics” add-in and I have also the same issue is this
    something in the add-in or PC?


    And is it possible to add the ProgressiveToolTip at the AdnButtonCommandBase in
    the CommandUtils?


    Regards,

    Marco.'
