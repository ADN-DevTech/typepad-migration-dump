  body: 'With .NET is even easier because you can edit the sketch and loop through
    all the textboxes looking for the "PROMT" entries in the .FormattedText property.


    But I have another question: how can you read the VALUE of a prompted text in
    a title block?

    I need to change a title block with another, keeping the values of the prompted
    entries, can you suggest a method please?


    Thanks
