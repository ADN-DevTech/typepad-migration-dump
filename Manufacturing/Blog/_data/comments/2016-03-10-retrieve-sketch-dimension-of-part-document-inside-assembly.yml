  body: 'What exact error are you getting on that line? You should try it from VBA
    and then debug into the code and investigate the various objects. Maybe in that
    specific sketch you don''t have dimension constraints?

    The best thing would be to post this question on the Inventor Customisation forum.
    That''s much better for this than the comments section of the blog :)'

  body: 'Ok thanks for your fast answer and apologize for posting my question here,
    I''ll do the same on the forum.

    I actually don''t know how to convert the code to VBA and where/how to debug it,
    as I started learning this stuff a couple of months ago. I''ll give it a look.

    Acording to the sketch dimension constraints, I believe I have some sketches dimension-constrained
    in the part file...so as far as I know that shouldn''t be the problem.


    Again.. thanks for your time and effort.

    Keep up the good work!
