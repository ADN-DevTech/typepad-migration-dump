  body: Thank you for providing this example however I would sure appreciate it if
    you could take it a step farther and show how to properly set the icon's different
    states such as grounded, suppressed, etc.

  body: 'Hi Daniel,


    That function is part of VBA. In .NET you could do e.g. this to get an IDispPicture
    from your loaded bitmap:

    The SDK contains sample addins that show the whole thing: loading image, converting
    it to IDispPicture, adding it to a button.


    Cheers,
