  body: Hi, thank you for the awesome code snippet. I have been able to get the above
    code to work, but when trying to reopen a previously closed dockable window within
    Inventor 2014, it will not open.  Basically, the dockable window will open only
    once during the application.  Is there a way to make it open every time?  Thank
    you!

  body: 'Good Morning!

    What would be the reason that text boxes do not work in WPF control? it looks
    like the command is not executed by the control!


    Has anyone ever had this problem?
