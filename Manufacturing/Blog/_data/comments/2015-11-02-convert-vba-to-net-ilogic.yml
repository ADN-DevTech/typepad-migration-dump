  body: 'I don''t think we are planning to provide anything, but there seem to be
    some translators between VBA and VB.NET, e.g. <a href="http://www.tooloscope.com/en/IT-tools/migrate-excel-vba-to-vb-net.php">http://www.tooloscope.com/en/IT-tools/migrate-excel-vba-to-vb-net.php</a>

    Have not tried any of them though.
