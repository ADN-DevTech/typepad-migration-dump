  body: The Pick method is a simple way of getting a single selection.  For more control
    over the selection process, including getting multiple selections, you can use
    the InteractionEvents object.  It's more difficult to use but provides a lot more
    functionality.

  body: 'Thank you very much


    As I understand need create the class "clsSelect" (like in tutorial)

    I can do multi select

    But How add to Pick new objects ?

    Set Pick = oSelectedEnts.Item(1)


    Besides How shoot down selection Outside the class?



    I just need selection like in frame generator (trim/extend operation)

    after push button activate selection (after push button apply (I think so) stop
    selection)'

  body: 'Hi!


    I tried your code on two intersecting tubes that i want to sculpt. I am able to
    create a surfacebody of Tube2 in Tube1. But i am not able to create an adaptive
    surfacebody. Everytime i set "featureDef.IsAssociative = True" i got an error
    reading ''Wrong Parameters''


    Could you help me out?

    Thanks'

  body: "Hi,\n\nI am trying to create something similar to the Copy Object tool so\
    \ I started out with the code in this post which is working fine up until I try\
    \ to add more than one source body. \n\nI'm taking baby steps so basically what\
    \ I modified in your code is that I added a second surfaceBodyProxy (sourceBody2)\
    \ which is also selected by the user right after the first one. Then I add it\
    \ to the object collection (in the non-associative case I also create a newBody2\
    \ to transform and then add that to the collection). \nThen Inventor crashes when\
    \ trying to create the base feature. It seems like everything is OK until the\
    \ object collection contains only one object.\n\nDo you have any suggestions?\n\
    \nThank you!\n\n-----"
