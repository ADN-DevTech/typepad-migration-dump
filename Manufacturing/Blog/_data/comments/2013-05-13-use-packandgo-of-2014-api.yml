  body: I'm on a 64 bit OS and was set for AnyCPU but the code failed.  I then noticed
    below "Target CPU" there's a check box "Prefer 32-bit" which was on but after
    turning it off the code worked!

  body: Thanks! Just for anybody else looking for how to find the check box "Prefer
    32-bit", for Visual Studio 2015 I had to right click on the Project, select "Properties",
    Select "Compile", that's where you'll find the check box.

  body: Hi, I'm trying to implement this pack and go sample and it works well, but
    can you also sample the "oPacknGo.SearchForReferencingFiles" method? I keep getting
    exceptions on this.
