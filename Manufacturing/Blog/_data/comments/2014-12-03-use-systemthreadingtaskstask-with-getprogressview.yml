  body: 'This is funny – As the standard vault progress dialogs are not this way:


    Vault 2015: Upload – Only shows number of uploaded file as progress.

     This is bad when uploading a big file – Users think Vault is frozen 


    Vault 2015: Download – Same thing as above.


    A real bummer when you try to explain this to an end user being exposed

    to so many other software handling this a lot more elegantly.'
