  body: 'Awesome!!! I was just battling with this issue today, trying to help a customer.
    I couldn''t figure out what was locking the file. Thought I might try some VBA
    hackery as a quick and dirty fix, but he hadn''t fixed the VBA install on his
    machine, so I couldn''t use it in a hurry.


    Probably won''t use this to fix it in a live system, but at least I know wat causes
    it now.


    The best part is, earlier today, I searched for this topic and only found 2 unsolved
    forum posts. Tonight I was reading one of Xiaodong''s new posts, and just happened
    to notice this post of yours in the "You might also like.." section. SWEET!


    Cheers'
