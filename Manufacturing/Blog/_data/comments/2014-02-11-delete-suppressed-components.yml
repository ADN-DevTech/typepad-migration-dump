  body: 'Hello Adam,


    I find the macro very helpfull but encounter a problem when running the macro
    in a main assembly which contains iParts and iAssemblies.


    My goal is to suppress the parts that are "Excluded" in an iAssembly. Run from
    the main assembly


    So in the macro itself i have changed

    If occ.Suppressed Then

    occ.Delete


    to


    If occ.Excluded Then

    occ.Suppress

    This works fine when is run from the iAssembly itself.

    But i need it to work form the main assembly file.


    Run time error:

    Method ''SubOccurrences'' of object ''ComponentOccurrenceProxy'' failed


    Thank you'

  body: 'Hi Kevin,


    I''m not sure I understand how you get into that issue. Are you using the above
    code inside some other code? It seems to me that Occurrences and SubOccurrences
    do not include Excluded components in context of the main assembly.

    Best thing would be if you asked this question on the Inventor Customisation forum
    and provided non-confidential minimal sample documents, the exact code, the exact
    steps to reproduce the problem.


    Cheers,

    Adam'

    Global transactions seem to help somewhat. My current theory is that this is due
    to excessive amounts of undo information (or something) stored on disk.'
