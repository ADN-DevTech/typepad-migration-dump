  body: "Hi Xiaodong Liang,\n\nI am an inventor user who loves using several LOD's,\
    \ so this ilogic rule is very useful to me, thank you! I do have one question.\n\
    When creating the custom property, the mass displayed as a custom property has\
    \ 6 decimals. Looking closely at your screenshot, yours does too. \n\nDo you know\
    \ how to add the lod mass custom property with, for example only one (1) decimal?\n\
    \nKind regards!\nLars"
