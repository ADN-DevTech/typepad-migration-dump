  body: 'Hello,


    Under INVENTOR 2015, I wish to use ASSETLIBRARIES, ASSETS and so on in Visual
    STUDIO instead of VBA, I can''t access to those object. Which reference must I
    include in my project to let me use them ?


    My problem is to check that all material libraries I use under INVENTOR can load
    all styles needed by each material.


    Thanks for your help

    Thanks for the answer.


    However, I added the Inventor interop assembly as reference in my project but
    I didn''t find those objects. I haven''t any problems if I do it in VBA.


    I switch in the forum as you advised me.
