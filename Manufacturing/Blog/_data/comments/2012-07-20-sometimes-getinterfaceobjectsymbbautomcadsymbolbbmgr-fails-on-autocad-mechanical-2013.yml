  body: Got some other trubles finding the lib for this also ...  looks like adding
    the reference from the com tab adds a reference to tlb, and then a dll is generated
    in the solution ... is that a normal behaviour ?

  body: "Hi Barbara, \nI'm struggling with GetInterfaceObject(\"SymBBAuto.McadSymbolBBMgr\"\
    ) in 2013 on a clean machine too. I get an unhandled exception at 20bf9ce6h.\n\
    \nI guess the interops are not matching. I got the interops when I selected the\
    \ objects in the COM tab.\n\nDo you know where I can a set of reliable interops\
    \ for mechanical 2013?\n\nOr do you have another idea what can be wrong?\n\nThanks\
    \ in advance \nThomas"
