  body: "Hi All,\n\nI want to set a short cut key for Open drawing from part or assembly\
    \ so I don't have to choose which is done using Cntrl + O. I want to assign short\
    \ cut key so only that drawing opens. I Went to customise and keyboard tab and\
    \ went to open drawing under Control +O. How do I add or edit custom key for just\
    \ open drawing ? right click or left click on selection doesn't do anything ?\
    \ \n\nThanks for help. \n\n-----"
