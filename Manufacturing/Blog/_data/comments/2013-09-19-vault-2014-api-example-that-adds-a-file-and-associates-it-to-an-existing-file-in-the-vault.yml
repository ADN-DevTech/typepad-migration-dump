    I am looking for some help with Vault 2014 API for custom objects. What I am trying
    to achieve is that, I have created a custom object in C# and I would like to add
    the property instance from a windows form where the user can input a value this
    then is displayed under the property definition sysname column heading for that
    custom object. Can I achieve this using PropInst.val() call? Any help you be most
    appreciated.'
