  body: 'Hello Vladimir,


    I copy the vb.net code as it’s provided and try it with Inventor Build 219, Release:
    2012 SP2 on win7 x64bit machine.


    The only thing what I have changed is the DataFolder to the 2012 version.


    And I ran in three error’s (Unspecified error (Exception from HRESULT: 0x80004005
    (E_FAIL))).


    The first error occurs with placing the “StandardFactory, By string identifier”.


    The second error occurs with placing the “CustomFactory, Row by index”.


    And the last error occurs with placing the “CustomFactory, Row by string identifier”.


    Do you have any idea why this happened?


    Marco'

  body: 'The first error could be caused by invalid string identifier.  Parameter
    names and values may differ in 2012 and 2014 versions.  The same is true for the
    custom iPart as well.

    The second error could be caused by invalid file path.  Could you verify if the
    folder for custom iPart members exist.  In my sample "C:\temp" was used.

    Cheers'
