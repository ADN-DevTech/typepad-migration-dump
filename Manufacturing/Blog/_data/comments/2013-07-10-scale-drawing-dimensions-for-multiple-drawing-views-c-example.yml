  body: 'Hi Parthiv,


    Not sure about your question. Are you getting this error when you are building
    the example downloaded from this post? If you are talking about the Inventor API
    interop then see this directory:

    C:\Program Files\Autodesk\Inventor 2016\Bin\Public Assemblies


    If this related to something else please post the question on the Inventor customization
    forum. <a href="http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/inventor-customization/bd-p/120">http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/inventor-customization/bd-p/120</a>


    Thanks,

    Wayne
