  body: Hi Daniel...the links to the topics for each service section aren't working
    for me.  Are they still available?  Example...the AuthService link points to "http://adndevblog.typepad.com/manufacturing/2013/12/topic884.html"
    but nothing shows up.

    Hi Rob,


    Thank you for raising this up. I removed the hyperlinks, please refer to the document
    in Vault SDK for more information about these services.
