  body: "Hi,\n \nSorry to reply to an old post, but I can't get this to work properly.\
    \ I rewrote it to get it to copy my 2 event triggers from my template to the current\
    \ opened file, but only one of them runs initially when it should. The other doesn't\
    \ run. When I open the event triggers window, both rules are there. First (which\
    \ runs as it should) runs on before save, and creates a flat pattern if it doesn't\
    \ exist. The second runs (or should run) on iproperty change, and updates the\
    \ material and thickness of the sheet metal part according to two custom iproperties.\n\
    \nBUT, if I open the event triggers window, and then press OK (without changing\
    \ anything), then it works perfectly. If I just press cancel, it still doesn't\
    \ run.\n\nAny ideas what might cause this?"

    If I was you (I''m a novice at iLogic/VBA and really don''t know what I''m talking
    about!), I would add a 3rd rule that basically does nothing. Then you can see
    if all the rules above the last rule run, when you KNOW the last rule won''t run.

    Just a thought (work-around!).

    Cheers ...
