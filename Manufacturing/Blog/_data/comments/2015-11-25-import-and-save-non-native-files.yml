  body: 'Hi Antoine,

    First you should check if you can even do it in the UI. If that is running into
    issues too then the API won''t be able to do it either.

    If you need more help then best would be to log this on the Inventor Customisation
    forum and provide more information on what exactly you are doing.

    Cheers,

    Adam
