  body: "Hey. This is a great help! However, I have now encountered a separate problem.\
    \ \n\nWhen I go to execute the macro it gives the Run-time error '402': Must close\
    \ or hide topmost modal form first. I have the userform ask for user input to\
    \ create a box in autoCAD. Obviously when I input the last section  this does\
    \ not allow the user to enter anything into the form. I'm not sure how to fix\
    \ this. \n\nWhen I delete the  from my UserForm1 script, the new error message\
    \ when the user clicks \"okay\" on the UserForm text box I get a new run-time\
    \ error '-2145320932 (8021001c)': AutoCAD main window is invisible. \n\nAny thoughts?\
    \ Thanks!"
