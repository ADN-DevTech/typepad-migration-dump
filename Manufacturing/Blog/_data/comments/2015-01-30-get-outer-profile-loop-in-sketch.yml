    I love your website. It''s full of useful information for beginners like me. Thanks


    Now to why I am writing to you guys. I found this interesting bit of code at <a
    href="https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/inventor-forum/fast-selection-of-closed-profiles-in-sketch/m-p/7215732#M650263">https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/inventor-forum/fast-selection-of-closed-profiles-in-sketch/m-p/7215732#M650263</a>
    and was wondering if its possible to create surfaces rather than a solid.


    I have a sketch that contains open and closed shapes which may or may not be inside
    a block. Given that the extrude command ends after every selection the process
    of generating the surfaces gets tiresome. So I was wondering if anyone of you
    guys can figure out some code to achieve the surfaces in one go.


    Hope you can find the time to look at this request.


    Thank you
