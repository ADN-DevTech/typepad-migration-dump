    I was wondering if you could please post a blog about how to attach a balloon
    to an existing one?


    Thank you much!'

  body: 'Hi, I''m trying to achieve the same thing but instead of a balloon, I want
    the leader to attach to a Feature Control Frame Object but I get an error in return.
    I think this is a bug in Inventor 2018.


    I also want to attach a leader to a Surface Texture Symbol Object but I get the
    same error.


    Attaching to Dimensions or Drawing curves seems to work, so my error is in selecting
    the correct intent.

    When I investigate an existing Leader attached to an Feature Control Frame, the
    intent of the leader seems the same as the one I''m creating.


    Thanks to look into this.
