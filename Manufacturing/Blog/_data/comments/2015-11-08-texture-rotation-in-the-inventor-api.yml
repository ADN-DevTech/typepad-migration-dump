    when I change to one of my own materials the code no longer works.


    Is there a specific requirement in your material/Colour set up that enables this?'

    Is there any way to get the texture direction such as parallel with the X-axis,
    ...?


    Many thanks.

    \ is parallel with or following the U direction of the surface it's used on. If\
    \ the question is how to \"find out\" if the direction is parallel with X axis,\
    \ then you could do that based on the U direction of the surface. If the question\
    \ is how to \"make\" the texture direction parallel with the X axis, then you\
    \ would need to create separate texture for each surface as their U direction\
    \ will be different.   \n-----"
