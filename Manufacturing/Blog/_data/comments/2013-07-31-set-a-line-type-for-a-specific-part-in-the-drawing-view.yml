  body: "Is there a way to check for a certain line type and then perform an action\
    \ based on what the line type is? When I perform a check on drawing curves in\
    \ a view, all I get is \"kDefaultLineType\" on every line, regardless of whether\
    \ it is a visible line or a hidden line. I would like to be able to filter based\
    \ on whether it is a continuous line type and ignore other line types. \n-----"
