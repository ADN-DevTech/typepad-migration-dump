  body: "Hi, \n first of all many thanks for this article.\n I need some help to update\
    \ a Vault Extension from 2013 to 2015. I made an extension that automatically\
    \ update an item to the most recent file version during the checkout_Post event\
    \ of Inventor. This extension uses the old-and-removed function \"UpdateFromFile\"\
    .\n With the new Vault SDK i'm not able to obtain the same result; i don't want\
    \ to made a new item revision every time due to my company restrictions.\n\nI've\
    \ tried the new \"UpdateItemFileAssociation\" passing the unique Id coming from\
    \ the Inventor CheckIn event, but in Vault the result is that the item lose his\
    \ file (the primary). If i manually do an Update from the Vault client all is\
    \ ok again....but the intention of this extension is exactly to do an automatic\
    \ item update.\n\nI'm quite desperate....\n Thanks anyway in advance\n\nDave"
