    You can sort it any way you want based on the name of the columns.

  body: 'Hello Adam,


    I am new to the iLogic world and could possibly use your assistance with the Reorder
    parts list columns rule that you posted on 10/6/14. I am using a parts list that
    has multiple quantity sections. These are derived from an I assembly that I created.
    To make a long story short the quantity columns come in, in the wrong order and
    I have to manually go in and rearrange them every time. I tried to copy your code
    above to see if any of my parts list would reorder and it kept giving me an error.
    I have plenty of screen captures that I could send you for more detail. Please
    let me know if you are able to assist me on this.'
