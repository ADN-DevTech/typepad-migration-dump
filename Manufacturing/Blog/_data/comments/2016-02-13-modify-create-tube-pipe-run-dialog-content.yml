    You''ve got to give us more grip. How do we use this? Changing the default Filenames
    and Location for T&P is something we''ve been asking for a long time.'

  body: "Better? \n\nI don't know yet. I will have to learn how to program and then\
    \ will test this out. I was hopping something more like:\n\n- add this code to\
    \ the Tube and Pipe Routes.iam template and it will fire up automatically when\
    \ you start T&P.\nor\n- Create a new button and use the code to initiate the T&P\
    \ environment with it.\n\nI guess for now I need to wait for a wizard to come\
    \ along and show us how to do that, or ask in the Inventor customization forum.\n\
    \nThanks."
