    done. I was just looking for some comparison numbers too. Thanks!

  body: 'Hi,

    Is there any way I can pre-allow my addin to work


    meaning, skip the "Do you want to load addin" dialog box , since my addin is already
    allowed to load.


    I need an API to do that.


    regards'

  body: 'Hi,


    I''m trying to use the SDK Addin template to create a basic sample addin. But
    I believe the addin is not loaded because I''m unable to hit the breakpoint. I
    then realize that the addin does not have a signature. Do I need to sign it with
    this providers in order to be able to use the addin templates?


    Regards,'

  body: 'Hi Daniela,


    No you don''t "have to" sign it - but it is a good practice to follow if you are
    making a commercial application. e.g. for our App Store.

    In the meantime just go into the AddIn Manager and unblock it - which will keep
    it unblocked from then on.


    Cheers,

    Adam'
