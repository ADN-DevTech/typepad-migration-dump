  body: 'Its a good tip, but unfortunately the Inventor ''region properties'' tool
    is still inferior to the AutoCAD ''massprop'' command.


    If you have non symetrical section, the second moment of area is calced from the
    sketch origin, and not the centroid of the region.


    Also no bounding box data for the region is provided.

    it should really give overall width and height data, and distances from the centroid
    to these extreme region extents.


    Thanks for the info though.'

  body: 'Hi Adam,


    Thanks for posting this code snippet. You start off with "The code which is getting
    Region Properties information for a given sketch can be extended ..."


    Do you have a reference for that code that uses a given sketch? I looked through
    the forums and the developer examples and did not find anything.


    Thanks,

    Chris'
