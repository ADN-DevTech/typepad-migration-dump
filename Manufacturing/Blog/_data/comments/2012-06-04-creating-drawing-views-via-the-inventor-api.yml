  body: 'Hi Bob,


    What kind of error you got? I guess you forgot to initialize _InvApplication.
    this sample is based on a standalone EXE. it assumes you have got _InvApplication,
    e.g.

    _InvApplication= System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal.GetActiveObject("Inventor.Application")

    will get the the application of active Inventor process.'
