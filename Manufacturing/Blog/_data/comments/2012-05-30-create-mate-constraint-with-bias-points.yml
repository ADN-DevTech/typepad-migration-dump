  body: 'Yeah, maybe someone should mention, that if the subject to the added constraint
    is a workfeature instead of a face or edge, the biaspoint-coordinates are relative
    to the rootpoint of that particular workfeature , and not the origin of the definition
    of the occurrence that contains this workfeature, as otherwise. Took me half an
    afternoon to figure out, why my experiments here delivered results, that seemed
    to be completely random!
