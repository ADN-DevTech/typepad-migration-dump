  body: 'Hi Daniel,


    This is such a great contribution to the Vault developers community and such a
    useful tool for someone trying to get something out of its API.


    I wish I had this when I started my first (and only so far :) Vault + Revit APIs
    project.


    Thanks a bunch and keep up the good working,


    Constantin'

    just wanted to know it was possible.
