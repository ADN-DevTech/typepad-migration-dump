  body: 'Hi Adam,


    Do you have any pointers on getting the XAML window to display correctly? I copied
    your XAML code into my own addin and despite the addin loading correctly and the
    window opening when I click the button in the Ribbonbar, all I get is a white
    window with no buttons, calendar or checkbox.


    Thanks,


    Alex.


    PS. If it helps I will cross-post this to the Autodesk Forums.'
