  body: "I want to know is there any method which can identify that whether part is\
    \ a library part or a simple part. \nBasically \nI want to identify library and\
    \ content centre parts. We are sometimes using content center parts and apart\
    \ from that we had made numerous files which we are accessing from different folders.\
    \ We are defining those folders while defining new project as a library. \n\n\
    I want both library and content center files to be identified."

    DesignProjectManager.IsFileInActiveProject method. ProjectPathType argument will
    be set to kLibraryLocation if the file is in a library folder.
