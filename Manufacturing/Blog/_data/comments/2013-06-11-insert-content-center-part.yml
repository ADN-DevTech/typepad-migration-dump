  body: "Adam,\n\nI ran this code in Inventor 2019, but get an Error 91 when executing\
    \ the line:\n   member = cf.CreateMember(1, ee, \"Problem\")\n\nThe variable,\
    \ 'ee', is declared, but doesn't seem to have a value before it is assigned to\
    \ 'member'.\nShould this code work with Inventor 2019?\n\nRegards,\nJerry"
