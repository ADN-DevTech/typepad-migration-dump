  body: 'Sub Main() is throwing me...is this the only way to do it?  I have an if/then
    else if statement and trying to shoehorn the code in.


    If Brush = False Then

    Sub Main()

    Suppress folder and component pattern within the folder

    ElseIf Brush = True Then

    Sub

    Unsuppress folder and component pattern within the folder.

    End If


    Wish I knew more about coding...probably something I''m missing'

    \nTo paraphrase it, if you have multiple functions (Sub or Function) then the\
    \ first one needs to be Sub Main() - you don't call this function from anywhere\
    \ it's called by iLogic automatically, but you can call other functions from it.\
    \ Also when calling a function you should not prefix it with \"Sub \", just use\
    \ the name of the function.   \n\n-----"
