  body: Epic! This is an awesome tip! I've been doing it with MessageBox for years
    but it's not exactly neat and tidy. This is a far better solution. More recently,
    for more complicated stuff I've been writing dlls for the logic and importing
    them into the iLogic rule and then debugging the dll with visual studio, but that's
    a long way of doing it and kinda defeats the purpose of iLogic's simplicity. Thanks
    for sharing!
