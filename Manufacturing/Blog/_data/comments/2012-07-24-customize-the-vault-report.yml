  body: 'Thanks for your post, Barbara!


    I confirm. I had the same problem, with VS 2010. So, at now I''m using the VS
    2008 to edit RDLC files. Of course, it quite strange that the Vault 2013 still
    using MS Report Viewer 2008.'

  body: I heard from our engineering team that Visual Studio Express 2008 has support
    for RDLC editing, but this feature was removed from Visual Studio Express 2010.  So
    we still stuck with the 2008 format so that people still have a free RDLC editor
    from Visual Studio Express 2008.

    Is it possible to add new properties to an existing rdlc file?


    We have added new UDP''s in vault and want to update the rdlc file with these
