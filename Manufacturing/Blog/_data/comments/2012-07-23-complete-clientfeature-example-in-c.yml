  body: 'Thanks for the sample,

    Im still a bit confused though, Looking through the api docs (my only other source
    of information) gives me the idea that i''d need to inherit/implement the ClientFeatureX
    abstract classes/interfaces. But i dont see anything of that in your code...

    That makes me very curious what is going on inside the AdnInvUtilityLib.dll that
    you link to in the sample. Would it be possible to peek at the source of that?'

  body: 'There isn''t any class or interface you can implement in the native Inventor
    API, however I used this kind of approach in the code from AdnInvUtilityLib.dll.
    This is my own library to deal with Inventor add-in programming. I feel like it
    is more intuitive to provide abstract methods to implement.


    The full source code for that lib is available from that previous post:

    Your question has nothing to do with the topic of this post, in the future please
    use the forum to ask this kind of questions:

    Here is a post about using WPF in an Inventor Dockable Window:

    <a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/manufacturing/2012/06/embedding-a-wpf-user-control-in-a-dockablewindow-in-inventor.html">http://adndevblog.typepad.com/manufacturing/2012/06/embedding-a-wpf-user-control-in-a-dockablewindow-in-inventor.html</a>


    If you want to display a WPF form inside Inventor which is not contained inside
    a dockable dialog, you can just simply show your dialog, nothing specific to Inventor.'
