  body: "Hi Barbara,\nis there a way to know (using the Inventor API of course) which\
    \ files (component, assembly, sub-assembly, etc) Inventor are saving in Vault\
    \ when the designer Archive a file? One-step before the checkin appears a windows\
    \ with the complete list of files that they will be saved in Vault, and the user\
    \ can check/uncheck some files if he wants.\nIs there a way to know wich files\
    \ *effectively* Inventor shoots to Vault? \n\nI'm pretty sure that Inventor has\
    \ this information because the Vault Web Service is far to be called at this point\n\
    \nThanks in advance\nDave\n-----"
