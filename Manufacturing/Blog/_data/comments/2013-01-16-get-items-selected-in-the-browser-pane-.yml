  body: "Hello,\n\nmy Addin adds a custom entry to the contextmenu of the selected\

    BrowsernodeEvent.Selected\" to cache the selected node, nor a property on the\

  body: 'Hi Daniel,

    If you are right-clicking on an entity which is exposed through the API then it
    should be passed to the OnLinearMarkingMenu event which you need to use in order
    to add items to the context menu anyway - even in the browser: <a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/manufacturing/2015/03/entity-specific-context-menu.html">http://adndevblog.typepad.com/manufacturing/2015/03/entity-specific-context-menu.html</a>

    If you need further help then please log it on the API forum instead as the comment
    section of the blog is not really good for discussions.

    Cheers,

    Adam'

  body: 'Hello Adam,


    thanks for the reply. I''ll try your suggestion. I know about the forum and I
    use it as well, just posted it here because I felt, this question may be directly
    related to the blog post. :)

    Best Regards,

    Daniel
