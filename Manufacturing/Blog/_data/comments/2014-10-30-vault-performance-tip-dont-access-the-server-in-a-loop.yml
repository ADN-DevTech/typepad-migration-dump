  body: "Hi Wayne\nThanks for a nice article.\nUnfortunately your sample results in\
    \ a implicit webcall for folder information for each call to propValues.GetValue(fileIteration,\
    \ statusProp)\nIf the result files are in the same folder this can easily fixed\
    \ just by getting and adding the entityfolder to the fileiteration call:\n\nList\
    \ fileIterations = \nnew List(myResults.Select(result => new VDF.Vault.Currency.Entities.FileIteration(base.VaultConnection,\
    \ entityFolder, result)));\n\n\n-----"
