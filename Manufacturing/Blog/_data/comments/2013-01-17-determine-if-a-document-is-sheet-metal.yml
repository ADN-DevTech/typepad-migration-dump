  body: "Guys:\n\n   I realize this is way past the due date for comments, but I have\
    \ a question about doc types, if you would be so kind to answer.\n\n   Is a part\
    \ file that's been Converted to sheetmetal a valid sheetmetal file?\n\n   Reason\
    \ I ask is b/c I have an Inventor macro that dxf's-out the flat patterns, but\
    \ it never finds the FrameGenerator parts that I manually Converted into sheetmetal\
    \ parts (yeah, I realize that's a lotta manual labor on a big project!).\n\n \
    \  Thanx ... Chris"
