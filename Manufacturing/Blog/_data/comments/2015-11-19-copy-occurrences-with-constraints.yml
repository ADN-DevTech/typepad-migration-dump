  body: I enjoy reading these blog articles describing routines to accomplish different
    tasks in Inventor.  You probably are assuming that your readers know all the ins
    and outs of how to load and execute these routines.  I would appreciate it if
    you would consider dedicate a few of your articles on how to load and execute
    in Inventor and only applications.
