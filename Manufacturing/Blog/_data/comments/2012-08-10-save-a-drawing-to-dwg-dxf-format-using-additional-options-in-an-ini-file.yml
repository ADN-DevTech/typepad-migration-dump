    I was just wondering if you know of a way to also combine multiple .idw sheets
    into one AutoCAD .dwg file (preferably programmatically). I''m writing a program
    that configures an inventor model and drawing but needs to export to AutoCAD .dwg
    due to limitations of our PDM software.'

  body: 'very interesting post, thank you Adam!!

    By the way we are having one issue with this syntax (still in the VBA part for
    the moment): assuming that the drawing has multiple sheets with different formats,
    and assuming that corresponding DWT templates for generating the output in different
    formats are available, it is necessary to cycle through sheets adding the right
    oNameValueMap per each sheet, and clearing the object after exporting each sheet.


    Exactly in this context I suspect that the line


    Call oNameValueMap.Add("Export_Acad_IniFile", strIniFile)


    has no effect on the translator.


    Whatever I tried to do to pass the right strIniFile to the translator, this always
    uses the "from the GUI last used ini file".

    I tried to debug it at my best capacities, but still, even if the strIniFile is
    always right at each cycle, it does not appear to be passed to the translator.


    Are we missing anything?'

  body: '...I''ve found the solution myself: I did not notice a typo in the "Export_Acad_IniFile".

    My syntax was passing "Export_Acad_InFile" instead, thus ignoring the required
    INI file.

    With the right string it works perfectly.
