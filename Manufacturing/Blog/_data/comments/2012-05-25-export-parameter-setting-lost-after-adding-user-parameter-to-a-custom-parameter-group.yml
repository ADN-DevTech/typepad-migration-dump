  body: 'Hello Wayne,


    I see this is an old post, but this is closest I got to my issue doing google-search.
    It''s clear, how to create a customparametergroup and add a parameter to it. But
    I didn''t find a way, to remove them from the userparameter-group. So I have the
    same Parameter shown in two groups. I thought, the point with custom groups was
    to collect and group my Userdefined Parameter as needed... I understand that parameters
    have to be assigned to Parameter types (model, user, reference), but if I add
    them to a group I was expecting a way to "hide" them in the Group of their "real
    type" (actually they may disappear automatically in my eyes...). I inspected the
    parameter object, the parameters object and did not find an option "remove", or
    "hide".  So I can''t see the advantage if they are still shown as userparameters
    too (either in API, nor in Inventor)... It''s just blowing up the fx-table...

    Could you please provide me some information on this?

    Did I miss something on the concept...?

    Thanks in advance,

    Daniel


    PS: I''m programming for Inventor 2014 in this case (customer has this version)
