  body: 'Hi Cjjatpuresillica,

    They are just code snippet, many things like adding reference of Inventor assembly
    to the project, and importing the namespace are not mentioned, but certainly need
    to be done. I''d suggest you just to copy those code lines into an existing Inventor
    SDK VB.NET sample then it should work.'
