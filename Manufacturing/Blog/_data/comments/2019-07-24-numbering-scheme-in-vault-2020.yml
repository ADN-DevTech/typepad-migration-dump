  body: 'Hello.

    I am trying to create an ilogic rule for Inventor / Vault 22, although it can
    also be for Inventor / Vault 23, as I am going to migrate shortly, that allows
    me to save an Inventor file (A90.00534.ipt) and run a numbering scheme. The new
    name has to be A91.######.ipt. Can anyone help me?

    Thank you very much in advance.
