  body: 'Hello,


    I want to split a solid body to multiple bodies. Inventor always splits a body
    to two body. But sometimes i need 3 or more bodies from one body.


    Sample: Split a model look like " E " vertically. Inventor makes two body. But
    i want to have a 4 seperate bodies from this model.



    Regards,

    -----'
