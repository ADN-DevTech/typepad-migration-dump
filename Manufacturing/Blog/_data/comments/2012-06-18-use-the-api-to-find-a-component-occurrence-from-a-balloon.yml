  body: 'Hi Dan,


    That code is VB.Net, what programming language are you using? Once you get to
    know the objects that are involved it should be pretty straightforward to convert
    that in any other language.


    There are free tools on the web to convert between C# and VB.Net syntax also...'

    \ With this code is not working. \nI thought maybe something special is needed.\n\
    Thanks\nDan"

  body: 'Well this code is VB.Net. We do not encourage people to write VBA code because
    the technology is kind of deprecated, we rather push developers to .Net, so you
    will find on this blog mostly .Net examples.


    Unfortunately we cannot spend time converting back all our samples to VBA, you
    would need to learn a bit what the differences are between VBA nd VB.Net in order
    to do the conversion yourself. That''s mainly the variables declaration that need
    to be separated from the affectation and the use of "Set" keyword.


    You should be able to find easily resources on the web for beginners in order
    to understand the syntax and differences between those two languages.'

  body: 'Please note that if you''re using sheet metal or are otherwise pointing at
    the tangent edges of a round feature (sheet metal bend radius, possibly fillets
    as well), you should assign

    curve.ModelGeometry to a FaceProxy instead of an EdgeProxy.


    Spent some time trying to figure this out. I used a try/catch block to handle
    both cases, though you might get away with finding curve.ModelGeometry.type and
    using a conditional to handle each case.
