    apologize! I simply put the VBA code to a format tool in order to have a nicer
    code lines,but applied with VB.NET format. Now I copied the VBA code directly.
    It should work now.'

  body: 'Hi Xianodong,

    Thanks for the code. I''m trying to use it for placing some symbols at each start
    and end of centerline of work feature. It works ok, but I need to improve it.
    First I need to do it per view selection, at this moment the code will add symbols
    to all centerlines found on the drawings, but I need only for selected views.
    Should be possible and easy, however I can''t get it done. Please help if you
    can.

    Thanks

    -----'
