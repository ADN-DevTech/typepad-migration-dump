  body: 'Hello Augusto,


    I see this is a pretty old post, and there may be new approaches.

    I my case I need the parameter Values as "mm", "deg", "bool" or "text" values
    (without the dimension - but that is not the challenge :-) ). So following this
    topic I could parse the expression to internal units. That''s fine so far. But
    then I needed to convert Lenght-Pars to "mm" and Ang-Pars to "deg" an leave the
    others as they are. Is there a simple way to "categorize" the paramaters without
    the need to compare the returned "GetTypeFromString"-Enum to all possible UnitsTypeEnum?
    So I would need some select case construction or a linq-query, wouldn''t I?

    Thank you for taking time on this.

    BR,

    Daniel'

  body: "Hello Brian,\n\nthank you for the quick answer. I built something similar,\
    \ just liked to ask if there was a \"classification\" per Type available. There\
    \ is some textual reference in the API-Help... (it doens't state there was a property\
    \ for this, it's just in textdescription....)\n\nHere is my solution in form of\
    \ an extension method for the parameter object in case someone could use it:\n\
    \n    \n    Public Function ConvertToKeytechValue(p As Parameter) As String\n\
    \        Dim uom = DirectCast(p.Parent, Document).UnitsOfMeasure\n        Dim\
    \ ut As UnitsTypeEnum\n        Try\n            ut = uom.GetTypeFromString(p.Units)\n\
    \        Catch ex As Exception\n            Return p.Value\n        End Try\n\
    \        Dim utName As String = [Enum].GetName(GetType(UnitsTypeEnum), ut)\n \
    \       Dim pval As Double\n        Try\n            pval = uom.GetValueFromExpression(p.Expression,\
    \ ut)\n        Catch ex As Exception\n            Return p.Value\n        End\
    \ Try\n\n        Select Case True\n            Case utName.Contains(\"Angle\"\
    )\n                Return pval * (180.0 / Math.PI)\n            Case utName.Contains(\"\
    Length\")\n                Return pval * 10\n        End Select\n        Return\
    \ \"\"\n    End Function\n\nBR,\nDaniel"

    Before Brian jump in, for more complex questions, the API Forum is the best route:
