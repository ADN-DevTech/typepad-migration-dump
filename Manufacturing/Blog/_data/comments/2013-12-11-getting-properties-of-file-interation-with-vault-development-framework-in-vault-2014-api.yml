  body: 'Hi,


    I''m using this code to iterate through files in a specific folder. These files
    have userdefined properties. I want to acces the value of some of these properties
    not all of them, but when I ask for the propertyname I get something like this
    for my userdefined properties: ac22f16f-00c3-4990-.... and so on.. How can i acces
    the "Name" of the userdefined property?'
