  body: "Hi there, I'm looking to change the length of a content center structural\
    \ shape based on some variables.  this code looked like an interesting starting\
    \ point.  I was able to load it into my VBA project, it compiled ok, but when\
    \ I attempt to run \"CustomMember_ChangeRow\", I get a Error 13 Type Mismatch\
    \ Error on one of the first lines (Set oDef = oOcc.Definition).  \n\nI have an\
    \ assembly open with a few content center structural shapes, I see some info populated\
    \ in some items above this line (i.e. Set oOcc = oAsmDef.Occurrences.Item(oAsmDef.Occurrences.Count)\
    \ has a value), but I get this error.\n\nAny idea what could cause this?  Thanks\
    \ for the help!!"

  body: 'Hi Jeff, the code seems to assume that you want to edit the last occurrence
    in the assembly and so it''s a content center part file occurrence - in your case
    it''s probably an assembly occurrence?

    You could either modify the code to work with a selected occurrence, or move the
    cc part occurrence to the last place in the tree'

  body: 'Yup, that was it.  Seem like this is only for changing the row of the content
    center item, I''m looking to automate changing the length.  It does change the
    row, but leaves the file name the same, and I don''t see any options on how to
    modify the length in this.  Any ideas??  Thanks for the help!
