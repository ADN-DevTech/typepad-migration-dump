  body: 'Is there any way to use some other key or right mouse button to break from
    the loop? Many of my coworkers are Escape button mashers so: 1. Escape will seem
    like an odd button to press to continue the program and 2. they never press the
    escape button only once.


    By the way, thanks for this bit of code. I am slowly transitioning my code from
    iLogic to .NET, but I am not quite to the point of making the leap yet.'

    press.

    Doing it from an AddIn will be the best way to do sophisticated selection. :)'

  body: Exactly what I needed! Is there a way to leave the components that have been
    added to the list remain highlighted?  I have a rule that creates/activates a
    view rep and overrides their color to my choosing  and it would be nice to see
    the parts that have already been selected since I'm selecting 10-20 at a time.

  body: 'Hello,


    thanks for the post, it is very helpful!

    I was wondering if it''s possible to check if there are two identical objects
    in the object collection or maybe avoid the selection of an already existing object.


    I am using this rule in an assembly and I was trying to avoid having two identical
    parts in the collection.


    Thank you again,'

  body: 'Hi Claudia,


    You could just ignore those components from the selection. You could keep track
    of all the ComponentDefinition objects and if a ComponentOccurrence already had
    that Definition then you could ignore it.

    If you also want to unhighlight the component that might be tricky - as far as
    I remember iLogic was not good at updating the UI in that case. So for that using
    highlight set might be better: <a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/manufacturing/2016/01/keep-selection-between-rule-executions.html">http://adndevblog.typepad.com/manufacturing/2016/01/keep-selection-between-rule-executions.html</a>

    is it possible to use your code to select browsernodes in a drawing?

    What filter can I use?
