    You''ll need to convert the VBA code to iLogic:

    I created a simple rectangular profile part and gave the outer surfaces a canary

    Is it possible to have a thourough explaination ? Does Dictionary mean Library
    ? Where the colors are defined.


    I''m working on 50 ton structures and it would be very useful to have an easy
    way of defining a painted surface.'

  body: In case of assemblies where a part might cover a face whose appearance you
    set to a painted area it won't make a difference. Of course in reality it could
    be that you painted the whole part before pushing them together so they should
    still count as painted.
