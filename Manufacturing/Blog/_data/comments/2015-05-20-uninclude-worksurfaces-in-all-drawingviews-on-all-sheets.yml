    Could you please log this question on the Inventor Customisation forum and also
    provide a non-confidential document that could be used to reproduce the issue?

    That would make things easier.


    Thank you,

    Adam'

    Which forum specifically?

    I''m trying to make a quick and simple example, but its proving too simple and
    the codes are working just fine and doing what it should.

  body: 'Hi MIke,


    So the issue is with a Drawing View that is showing a flat pattern and also has
    work surfaces?

    Can you reproduce it with any flat pattern view?

    Could you please log it on the forum and provide a minimal sample part?


    Cheers,
