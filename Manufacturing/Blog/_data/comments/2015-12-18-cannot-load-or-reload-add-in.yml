    I have some problem with this load and unload things.


    My addin load and code on Activate() method works fine, but when i move to addins
    manager my addin is unchecked (unloaded), i can load it again (and Activate works
    again), but after this addin just unloaded again. Also Deactivate () method doesn''t
    triggered in all this steps. I just want that my addin works in background and
    triggered on srecified events, but this unload things is realy a problem for accomplish
    this.'

  body: "Hi,\nIn that case something in your Activate method is causing problems.\
    \ You should debug through that code to find the issue. \nIf you are still having\
    \ problems after that then you would need to narrow down your project to something\
    \ that you could share with us so we could reproduce the problem on our side,\
    \ then log it on the forum.\nCheers,\nAdam"
