  body: 'Thanks for the information! This is very helpful for something I am trying
    to do with IPT files. I have a few things I am running into though. This code
    does not seem to run if the user closes the file and chooses to check in the file
    at that time. Is there something that will catch that in that situation? Also
    when checking in the assembly or drawing that uses this part, it doesn''t run
    since the check in command is done in the parent file. Thanks any feedback would
    be great!
