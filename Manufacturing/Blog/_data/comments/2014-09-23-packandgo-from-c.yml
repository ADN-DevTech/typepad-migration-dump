  body: 'sorry ask again.

    I want to download and check your source, But i cant in office.

    So. I added reference sldworks.tlb where was SolidWorks 2015 installed folder.

    And make a CPackAndGo.h Class.


    I tried this.

    IModelDoc2 model = NULL;

    CString modelPath = pConv->m_OriginalFilePath;

    bRes = pswCtrl->OpenModel(modelPath, model);

    IModelDocExtension swDocExt = model.GetExtension();

    CPackAndGo swPackAndGo = swDocExt.GetPackAndGo();


    But IModelDocExtension had not GetPackAndGo method.

    may i refered wrong library?'
