  body: "Hi Philippe,\n\nI am really new to Inventor API programming and am tring\
    \ to find my way through sample code. This topic was very interesting to try.\n\
    \nIf I am running the code it seems to fail on this part:\n\n\nCreate section\
    \ view Area:\n\noFrontView.Sketches.Add\n        oSectionSketch.Edit()\n\nIf I\
    \ type a \".\" after Sketches I am not able to select the Add.0Section.Edit()\n\
    \nThe error that I am getting states there has been a change to the class library?\n\
    \nCan you pls help me resolving this?\n\nThanks and regards,\n\nMichel"

  body: "Hi,\n  The above example is for creating a drawing for a part. Is the process\
    \ the same while creating a drawing for an assembly? The attributes are contained\
    \ in the parts / subassemblies and do not show up at assembly level. Do you have\
    \ sample code for the same?\n\nThanks & Regards,\n\nShapoor"
