  body: 'I have found that some elements/elementId''s create an exception when using
    ''set_ProjColorOverrideByElement''. Because I''m passing it a collection of elementId''s,
    I''m not sure which element is causing it. I''ve tried testing for a number of
    things when I''m creating the elementSet, but I cant figure what it is about the
    element that''s causing the problem. Do you know what is causing this? Or have
    any suggestions on what I might test for while creating the elementSet? Thank
    you.
