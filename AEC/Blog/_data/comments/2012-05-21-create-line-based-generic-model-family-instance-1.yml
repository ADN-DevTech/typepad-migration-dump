    Thanks for API.

    But I tried to do that exercise, but it doesn''t work, may be I use Revit 2015?


    Is it possible can you explain me how to create this API and how to run it correct
    in Revit 2015?


    Thanks for your answer.

    My best regards,'

  body: 'Joe,

    Thank you!  This method does allow placement of a generic line based family and
    allows movement by adjusting the location curve, but what I would really like
    is to host the family to a named Reference Plane, as can be done in the Revit
    UI.  I''m able to get a reference to the sketchplane of the desired reference
    plane, but all overloads of the NewFamilyInstance() fail when passed the reference.  Is
    it possible?  Thanks.
