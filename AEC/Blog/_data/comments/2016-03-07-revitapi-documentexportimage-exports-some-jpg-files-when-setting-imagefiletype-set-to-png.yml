  body: 'Hi,


    Thanks for the post!

    I can see that this will help in my workflow.


    but i am new to C# and programming.


    I had managed to complete the building "my 1st revit plugin" by autodesk.

    but i don''t understand. most of these code.

    and don''t you need to import the API into the code?


    can anyone explain or able to point me to the right direction?

    thanks

    -----'
