  body: 'It seems like adding a viewpoint with the comapi seems to slow down the more
    viewpoints there are in the file system, this does not occur when adding using
    the net api. The slowdown seems to be very significant once you reach about 300
    views. Perhaps the comapi is reindexing the file system on every add call and
    the net api defers this process. Considering the comapi is the only way to apply
    material and hide attributes, this bottleneck of performance is significant. Do
    you have any work arounds to convert a InwOpView to a Viewpoint without losing
    the applied attributes?
