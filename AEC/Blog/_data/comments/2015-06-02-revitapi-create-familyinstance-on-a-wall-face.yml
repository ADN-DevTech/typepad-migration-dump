  body: 'Thank you for this code.  We have an App that place electrical outlets in
    a space and this works great 90% of the time.  The issue we have is on some interior
    rooms it uses the correct face of the wall but the hosted deice is 180 degrees
    off.  So the device face is inside the wall and the back of the device is in the
    room.  Using the snoop command on the device and on the host wall I can''t see
    how to calculate the correct reference direction?  Also when I use anything other
    than (0,0,0) for the reference direction it throws an error that the says reference
    direction is parallel to the host.  I tried (0,1,0) (1,0,0) (0,0,1) all with the
    same results.

    Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!'

  body: "Hey Aaron\nReally need this to work me. \nI have done everything in your\
    \ post and it errors out on the line to create the new family instance. \n\nI\
    \ am trying this on a sample drawing with four walls. \nI am finding INSIDE surface\
    \ of each wall. \nThere is something it does not like about the surface. \nSince\
    \ the walls are all oriented @ 0 degrees or @90 degrees, I don't require a line\
    \ equation to find the surface. \n\nOne co ordinate is constant for the plane,\
    \ and the other I am taking to be the average of the highest and lowest cordinate\
    \ of the non constant axis. \n\nPlease help. \nThanks"
