  body: 'Does any of this work in 2019,  I am trying to get a simple Addin to work,
    and nothing shows in Navisworks Manage 2019,  I downloaded the Basic Plugin files,  changed
    it to .net 4.8 and pointed the references to my 2019 navisworks folder.

    Still the addin buttons do not show in Navisworks 2019???!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!'
