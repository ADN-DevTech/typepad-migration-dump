  body: 'While not robustly supported, the Visual LISP commands (VL-*, VLAX-*) can
    be used to access data from AutoCAD Architecture (ACA) objects.  The ACA Help
    pull-down includes an item to open the AutoCAD Architecture Developer Help (which
    probably has not been updated in years), which lists the basics of the object
    model and can be used to figure out where the desired data resides.


    No doubt that those with the skills to use .NET will have an easier time of it,
    but for those of us without the time to master that, things that used to be available
    via DXF can still be accessed via Visual LISP.'

    \ few left from the original ACA team told me that 2017 is the 20th release of\
    \ ACA, including 3.3 and German only 2.0. Some of you who knows ACA for a long\
    \ time, may feel nostalgic. Congratulations to the successful launch of 20th ACA!"

    Can I ask you a question about aca here?

    I''m trying to get a bound line from a slab with autolisp, but what to do.
