  body: 'Sun Settings can specify the ground level. You can set it in Manage tab>”Sun
    Settings” in UI. These settings are accessible in API. You can find the ground
    level of the settings in the current view from SunAndShadowSettings.LevelId property.
    There is a sample code in the API reference in the SDK. I investigated but  LEVEL_IS_GROUND_PLANE
    built-in parameter seems to be unused.
