  body: 'Hi Saikat,


    just an addition:


    As far as I know, there could be situations where AnnotationSymbols need to be
    rotated immediately after creating them.

    Depending on the orientation of the view a AnnotationSymbol is placed in, it may
    occurr that it is displayed upside-down.

    So one must make sure its orientation is correct *after inserting*, by rotating
    them.



    Best regards,

    Rudolf'

  body: 'Does any know if a you can tap into the previewing of tagging placement to
    use with a custom tagging command that creates a perfect flat/short landing on
    the leader.

    We already have an program that creates the tag  on two clicks & then modifies
    the landing accordingly based on text length & orientation/direction from object,
    but we can''t see it until/preview until after the second click/placement.

    A very short video of what I am asking about.
