  body: Hi Aaron, This looks helpful. Any chance you could provide a working solution?
    I cannot quite implement this. In any case, thanks. Dale

  body: 'Hi Dale, not sure what is your problem. I guess you did put the code in right
    place.

    all those code should be better put in IExternalApplication''s OnStartup method.'

  body: 'I know this post is rather old, but how do you "cancel" the updater? For
    example, we have very stringent naming conventions for view and I have provided
    a prompt to users when the views are created to provide a Name and Title on Sheet,
    but I would like to make sure they do it. As such, if they "cancel" from the naming
    form, can I cancel the view creation and/or delete it? I did try to "delete" it
    using the AddedId but that threw an exception as I assume it can''t be deleted
    until the IUpdater transaction is committed. Thoughts?
