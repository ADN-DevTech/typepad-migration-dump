  body: 'Good post!


    I''ve got an inputPlugin that I''ve put together, which intercepts the mouse clicks
    to record data as I measure. One issue that I''ve found is that I want to make
    it ignore right-click default behaviour while the tool is active (specifically
    because I don''t want it to cancel the measurement tool), however it still seems
    to do the right-click action. Any thoughts on how to intercept the right-click
    and ensure that it does nothing?
