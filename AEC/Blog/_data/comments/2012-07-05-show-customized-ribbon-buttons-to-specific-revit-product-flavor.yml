  body: Architects use Revit Architecture to create construction documents consisting
    of plans, elevations, details and sometimes computer renderings. These drawings
    or views need to be plotted to scale so that clients, contractors or others can
    simply pick up an architect's or engineer's scale and determine a detail's length,
    size or other important factors. If a drawing is not plotted to scale, errors
    could occur in the field and the structure might be built incorrectly.

  body: 'Is there a way to do this with Application type Addins?


    We are utilizing a Citrix virtual app environment at a multidiscipline firm, so
    with most add-ins installed to ProgramData location, everybody gets everything.
    It would be great if disabling a discipline specific tool set in the Revit Options
    could also hide that discipline''s related add-ins!
