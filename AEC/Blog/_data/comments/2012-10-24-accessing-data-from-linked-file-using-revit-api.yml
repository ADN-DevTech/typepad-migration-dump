  body: 'Sorry to resurrect this thread, but I am having problems getting the linked
    document...


    Basically, when I have a document loaded, that has a linked document, I cannot
    get the ''linked'' document object. Even when iterating through all of uiApp.Application.documents...


    Even to the point, that the collection size is only 1 and not 2. eg. The main
    document and the linked one.'

    only 1 document, 2014 had 2 (as it should have..)
