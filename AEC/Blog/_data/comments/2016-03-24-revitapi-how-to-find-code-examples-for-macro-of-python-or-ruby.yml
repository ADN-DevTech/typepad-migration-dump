  body: Actually let me mention this. you also have to hi the Build Button under the
    Build so that SharpDevelop can "recompile" it i guess. you do this after you either
    comment out or remove the "if false" statement for the ones you want. you have
    to unindent all the definitions under the If False statement that you deleted/commented
    out
