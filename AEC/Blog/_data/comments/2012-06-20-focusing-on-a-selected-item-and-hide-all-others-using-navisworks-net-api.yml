  body: "Hi Saikat,\nCould you explain a bit more about the model hierarchy in regards\
    \ to the properties ModelItem has, such as Parent, Children, AncestorsAndSelf,\
    \ etc? \n\nI am having trouble of the collection from executing hidden.AddRange(toShow.Parent.Children)\
    \ line. In one of my ifc test model there are 29 model items so I expect the hidden\
    \ collection to have the count as 29 after running the line, but I received 31\
    \ instead. I think I have some misunderstanding on  model hierarchy but couldn't\
    \ find much detail on the net.\n\nPlease help, thanks!"
