  body: "Hi Rigel, \n\nNo straightforward way. You may try exporting to FBX or DWF\
    \ and use other tools like FBX SDK or DWFtoolkit to extract geometry. (I need\
    \ to warn you that I don't know those SDK and support might be limited to Forum\
    \ only as oppose to through ADN.)  \nXiaodong also wrote the following post: \n\

    It might give you an idea."

    on the file and choose to copy it to the Bim 360 Glue app.

  body: 'BIM 360 glue, is excellent for managing, coordinating and reviewing nwd files
    if they are synchronized with the ipad, I manage to manipulate and open truly
    large files of process plants, refineries, generation and brings a lot of versatility
    to the construction work. It would be excellent if it were possible to touch a
    point of the geometry and to give me rectangular data of the point, that would
    allow me to work with project data with respect to 0.0,0 of Plant.

  body: I just tried installing it on my iPad (Pro iOS 14.3) and tried with a little
    gate house sample. (while thinking that this post is quite old.) To my surprise,
    it works.  You may contact product support team to verify if it is officially
    supported or not.
