    Sorry I dont know of any workaround that I can suggest. Regarding the exception
    with Sheet view, we have discussed this internally and the Development team is
    aware of this.'

  body: "Hey everyone,\n\nI was having this same problem with picking a point in a\
    \ sheet and I think I figured out a workaround.  By adding a line and then deleting\
    \ it in a transaction before picking the point, then the workplane will be set.\n\
    \nTransaction t1 = new Transaction(doc, \"WorkPlane\");\n                t1.Start();\n\
    \t\t\t\tLine line1 = app.Create.NewLineBound(XYZ.Zero, XYZ.BasisX);\n\t\t\t\t\
    DetailCurve dc1 = doc.Create.NewDetailCurve(doc.ActiveView, line1);\n\t\t\t\t\
    ElementId id = dc1.Id;\n\t\t\t\tdoc.Delete(id);\n\t\t\t\tt1.Commit();\nXYZ point\
    \ = uidoc.Selection.PickPoint(\"Pick a Point\");\n\nI tried doing a rollback but\
    \ didn't work.  Seems as though it needs to be committed."
