  body: "Xiaodong,\n\n   No Offense, but I think the term \"fast\" is misleading in\
    \ this post. Since the search API works in linear fashion its performance is going\
    \ to be dependent on the size of the Navisworks File. If Autodesk would just introduce\
    \ some form of Parallelism this search API could be fantastic! How Could this\
    \ be done? A possible solution would be to spawn threads on the Root's children\
    \ Items only, but I am only guessing that this is possible here because I do not\
    \ know the underlying Code base For the Navisworks API & what shape it is in.\
    \ One can dream thou....\n\n\nRegards,\nColin"

  body: "Hi Colin, \n\nSorry, I was not able to respond to you. I agree the speed\
    \ depends on the size of the file. However when I said‘fastest”, I compared the\
    \ three finding ways:\nIteration, LINQ and Search API that I introduced in the\
    \ other post\n <a href=\"http://adndevblog.typepad.com/aec/2012/05/navisworks-net-api-find-item.html\"\
    >http://adndevblog.typepad.com/aec/2012/05/navisworks-net-api-find-item.html</a>\n\
    \nIn addition, I did not mention two best practices: \n\n1)\tIf the items count\
    \ is very small, Iteration or LINQ are not so bad, compared with Search API. It\
    \ depends on your workflow.\n\n2)\tSometimes a finding workflow could combine\
    \ Search API + LINQ if you are good at LINQ. e.g. use Search API to do some first\
    \ searching within many items, then get smaller count, finally use LINQ to do\
    \ advanced searching .\n\nI am not clear what you meant by ‘Parallelism this search\
    \ API’. Could you elaborate it? The current usage of Search API is like what shown\
    \ in the post. I have not yet seen other usages.\n\nRegards,\nXiaodong Liang"

  body: "Xiaodong,\n\n   Please correct me if I am wrong. From what I have seen the\
    \ Search API runs in a linear manner (processing one node at a time). If the Search\
    \ API could some how preform a search on multiple nodes at the same time this\
    \ would be fantastic. \n\nFor Example if you were able to conduct a search on\
    \ the child nodes of the Main Root node, using multiple Threads to preform the\
    \ work with an Event for completion & for Progress. I think you would see huge\
    \ performance gains especially in large models\n\nColin"

    multiple threads for search could speed the process up.
