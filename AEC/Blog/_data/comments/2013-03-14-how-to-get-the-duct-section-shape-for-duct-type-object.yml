  body: "Hey Joe,\n\nI use another way to determine the duct profile that doesn't\
    \ involve opening any families, so it might be faster than the method you posted.\
    \  I've been using it for a while and haven't run into any problems with it. \
    \ Code is for Revit 2012\n\nAutodesk.Revit.DB.Mechanical.Duct duct = elem as Autodesk.Revit.DB.Mechanical.Duct;\n\
    if (duct != null)\n{\n\tConnectorSetIterator iterator = duct.ConnectorManager.Connectors.ForwardIterator();\n\
    \n\titerator.MoveNext();\n\n\tConnector firstConnector = iterator.Current as Connector;\n\
    \n\tConnectorProfileType type = firstConnector.Shape;\n}"

  body: "Dear Colin,\n\nThanks for sharing this idea. \nIt is a good solution for\
    \ a given duct.\n\nHowever, the code in this blog post is for a given duct type.\n\
    It is possible that the given duct type doesn't have the instance in the model.\
    \ So we have to open a family document to get the duct shape.\n\nRegards,\n\n\
