  body: 'Hello,

    Is there any way to perform a search and apply overridetransparency on said search
    ? Something like Set s = roamer.state.objectFactory(Search) ?

    I can''t find any resource on VBS syntax for Navisworks. There''s only 2 examples
    left in the api folder, the rest is C# and I don''t know how to use it. The documentation
    doesn''t make it overly clear either. All I need to make is a simple VBS file
    to automate transparency replacements.


    I would be very grateful if you could help.
