    I am trying to write one center point of a clash result I have selected in Clash
    Detective to a text file. I cant seem to grasp how to do this correctly. I can
    get all the result center point wrote to a text file but not a specifically selected
    one (thanks to the help of your code). Is this even Possible? Any help would be
    greatly appreciated.


    Thanks,

    Al'
