  body: Can you give an example of saving and closing a document opened with OpenAndActivateDocument?
    There is no Close like with uiApp.Application.OpenDocumentFile. Thanks.

  body: "Hi Bryan,\n\nThis is the limitation. An active document can not be closed\
    \ by Revit API currently. The workaround for closing the active document is to\
    \ use the OpenAndActivateDocument() to open a new Revit document and then you\
    \ can close the previous active document (which is the document you want to closeI).\
    \ The newly opened document would still need to closed manually at some point.\
    \ \n\nAn unsupported workaround you can refer to the following blog post by Jeremy\
    \ Tammik : <a href=\"http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2010/10/closing-the-active-document-and-why-not-to.html.\"\
    >http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2010/10/closing-the-active-document-and-why-not-to.html.</a>\
    \ You might look into this at your own risk. \n\n-----"
