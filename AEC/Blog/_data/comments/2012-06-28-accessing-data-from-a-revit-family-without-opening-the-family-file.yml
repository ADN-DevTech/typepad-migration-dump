  body: Using the path of the family I was able to get some sizes but some families
    don´t have any familypath data. I'm thinking that maybe I can same those families
    in a folder and then check their sizes. Please some advice.

    I thought over your requirement and I dont think there is any direct way to get
    the information you need regarding the loaded file sizes. Your workflow/workaround
    might be the most optimal one at this moment.


    Cheers'
