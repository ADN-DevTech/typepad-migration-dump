    and Navisworks Manage 2015 and the program gives me an error when double clicking.

  body: "Hi Patrick,\n\nThis code still works well in Navisworks 2016 at my side.\
    \ It looks it can work when the object has at least one URL that is attached,\
    \ otherwise, it will crash. but you can add try-catch for \n ComApi.InwURLOverride\
    \ oURLOver = state.GetOverrideURL(oPathInCOMAPI);\n\nhope this helps."
