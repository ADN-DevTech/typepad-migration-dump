  body: "I am trying to replicate what happens at the Find Items Interface where by\
    \ clicking on the Category List, all the unique categories in the entire model\
    \ get listed; and by clicking on the Property List, all the unique properties\
    \ in the entire model under the selected category get listed. I have looked in\
    \ .Net API and .COM API with no success. \n\nIn .Net, I accessed the PropertyCategoryCollection\
    \ class for every ModelItem in the entire model and ran If Statement to find a\
    \ unique PropertyCategory and PropertyData. However, this takes forever in a large\
    \ model.\n\nIn COM, I used GetGUIPropertyNode and GUIAttributes methods to accessed\
    \ InwGUIAttributesColl class for every InwOaPath in the entire model and ran If\
    \ Statement to find a unique InwOaPropertyAttribute and InwOaProperty. Same thing,\
    \ the process would take a long time. \n\nIs there any way to make this process\
    \ faster similar to the Find Items interface\n\n-----"
