  body: 'Hi there,


    very good example. I have a few questions:


    1) How can i save a new SavedViewPoint directly into a folder? It seams i always
    have to save a copy (AddCopy()) into the SavedViewpoints collection before i can
    append the SavedViewPoint to a folder. the Children collection of a folder does
    not have a AddCopy method.


    2) In the GUI there is the option in the global settings "Viewpoint Defaults"
    section to save hide/show settings with a view. How is this possible with the
    api? I am not able to "attach" hide/view settings to a new SavedViewPoint that
    i create using the api.


    Thanks and kind regards,

    Gregor'

    I wrote a blog to answer your first question.

    <a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/aec/2012/07/move-saved-viewpoint-to-folder.html">http://adndevblog.typepad.com/aec/2012/07/move-saved-viewpoint-to-folder.html</a>


    as to the second question, you will need COM API by InwOpView.ApplyHideAttribs
    ApplyMaterialAttribs.


    I hope I could post some blogs about how to access saved viewpoint by COM API
    soon.
