  body: 'Hi,


    I''m curious if support has been added in the API yet for graphic properties?


    I''m not concerned with adding a property into the property set (I''m happy to
    have that predefined in my templates), but I do need a way to override the default
    block/image on a specific object (like a structural member). This can be done
    manually in the extended data tab of the properties palette, but I''m hoping to
    automate it.


    In .NET I normally set the value of a schedule data property using something like
    this…


    propSet.SetAt(propSet.PropertyNameToId(propName), propVal)


    I have tried having propVal of type PropertyDefinitionGraphic/BlockTableRecord/ObjectId/String
    etc. but nothing is working (it works fine if it is not a manual property not
    a graphic one).


    PS. I only tried in 2013 version I will try again in 2015 to see if it has changed.


    Thanks,


    Graham'

  body: 'I would like to add a list of values within a property set definition.

    How do you do that?

    There is a DataType.List value in the DataType enum.

    There is a ListDefinitionId in PropertyDefinition.


    Can I add a list of values like


    Part Id, Supplier Name, Catalogue number'
