  body: 'Hello


    I''m wandering if there are any limitations/licensing problems with including
    nwcreate.dll and nwcreate_data sub folder with all necessary files in my custom
    application installation? My app has nothing in common with Autodesk, except it
    provides an option to make nwc file readable by NavisWorks.


    Thank you
