  body: "Hello Augusto,\nI find the add-in manager (AIM) very useful and use it often.\
    \ Thank you!\n\nThere is one small issue with it - I wonder whether you could\
    \ fix it and re-release it?\n\nIt only happens when debugging in 2014 after debugging\
    \ 2015. (My apps support Revit 2011-2015.)\nThe 'Loaded Commands' in the Revit\
    \ 2014 version of AIM default to the Revit 2015 dll version.\nIf I don't notice,\
    \ I end up trying to debug for issues that aren't there - it's just a versioning\
    \ variation in my code.\n\nAs Revit 2011-Revit 2014 don't do this to the other\
    \ versions, I figure this isn't by design.\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like\
    \ any more information. \n\nKind regards,\n\n\nMatt"

    The AIM is saving the .addins for 2014, even after you open on 2015.


    Please make sure the .addins are on the proper folder (for each Revit version).

    At the .addin file, replace:

    [TARGETDIR]AddInManager.dll


    With:

    .\AddInManager.dll


    And it should work.

    The DLL used on this video was not developed by Autodesk, you should contact the
    author of the video about it. Sorry we cannot help.

  body: Augusto, now that everyone has the addin running in revit can you address
    the issue that this release is simply the 2014 version? In fact, when i switch
    between 2014 and 2015 Revit I see the same loaded commands in both, indicating
    that the two are using the same configurations or settings, etc. Another issue
    is that trying to save a command to the addins folder from 2015 saves the addin
    manifest to the 2014 addins folder instead. I'm not sure if this is hardcoded,
    but I could not find anything in the .config to change this (is there anything
    written to the registryfrom the .msi installer?). I believe I am also having an
    issue with xaml resources due to this very problem. If Autodesk is unwilling to
    continue support of this tool, would it be possible to release the code to the
    community so that we can keep it viable? Thank you for responding.
