  body: Would like to see some one take the lead and begin printing 1:1 scale (framing
    data) on a substrates many of them that builders use to drive IPD on the jobsite.
    Proven to be a time/labor saver by our team.

  body: "Hi Michael, \n\nIs this an API wish? Or product feature? Or perhaps you are\
    \ asking a 3rd party developer to do this for you?  \n\nIf it's an API wish, please\
    \ keep eyes on the next wish list survey. \n\nIf it is the feature request, I\
    \ would suggest trying to post at one of Revit Architecture/Structure/MEP forum:\n\

    \nAlso, if you can add some links about substrates and IPD, that will help educate\
    \ a person like me (who does not know the detail on job site) :-) We are always\
    \ looking for an idea about API samples. I'm curious to learn about it. Thank\
    \ you.      \n-----"
