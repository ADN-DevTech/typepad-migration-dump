  body: 'I am wondering if it is possible to make the InwOpUserSelectionTreePlugin
    interactive with the current selection.

    In other word, is there any way to make the sub-tree generated by InwOpUserSelectionTreePlugin
    expand and highlight selected objects similar to main selection tree?
