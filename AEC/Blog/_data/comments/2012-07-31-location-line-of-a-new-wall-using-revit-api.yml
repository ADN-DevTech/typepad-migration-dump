    is there a document in which every enum parameter is explained in detail ?

    At the moment, we need to use Revit Lookup to evaluate the  different values.


    That means:

    Changing param in UI, using Lookup to get the relating integer, changing param
    per UI again, using Lookup again, and so on.


    That would be unnecessary if there would be a list, a document in which the enums
    are explained as you did in this posting.


    Cheers,

    Rudolf'

    are displayed in the correct order, so we can get the clear names easily.

    First string refers to 0, second to 1, and so on...


    But nontheless, it would be good to have a ready-made, complete list of all enum
    params with all corresponding UI strings.


    Cheers,

    Sorry for the delay in updating you about your comment on this post. I too agree
    that it will be good to have enum parameters listed which can be directly used
    instead of having to work with number. Infact the API does expose a enum called
    WallLocationLine enum which is used to create FaceWalls only at the moment. It
    might be good to use this existing enum itself to set the location line for a
    wall. I am discussing this further with my colleagues.


    cheers
