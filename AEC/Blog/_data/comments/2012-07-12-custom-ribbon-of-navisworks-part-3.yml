  body: 'Thanks a lot for the detailed example.

    I successfully created and addin with its custom Ribbon Tab and Button.


    If I develop more addins, how can I add more buttons to the same Tab? If each
    addin has a CustomRibbonCommandHandler.cs and CustomRibbon.xaml I see that it
    either overwrites the other tabs or more tabs with the same name are created!
    I couldn''t find a way to add buttons to an existing tab...


    Thanks,'

    Thanks for the article. I have the same problem as ''Teocomi'' and would like
    to find a solution to be used in App Store for multiple products.


    Is there any way to use the same Tab for different plugins?


    Thanks,

    Afshin'

  body: "Hello,\n\nI developed a plug-in that is already working and has it's own\
    \ Ribbon Tab with a title of \"Tool add/ins 1\" but I guess it's a default name\
    \ that I can't change. I'm using VS 2017 and Navisworks Manage 2018.\n\nThe weird\
    \ thing here is that I already have this:\n\n [Plugin(\"Timeliner.DumpTimelinerTasks\"\
    ,                     // Plugin name\n        \"ADSK\",                      \
    \                       // Developer ID or GUID\n        ToolTip = \"Timeliner.DumpTimelinerTasks\
    \ tool tip\",  // The tooltip for the item in the ribbon\n        DisplayName\
    \ = \"X\")]                          // Display name for the Plugin in the Ribbon\n\
    \n    [Strings(\"ADNRibbonDemo.name\")]\n    [RibbonLayout(\"ADNRibbonDemo.xaml\"\
    )]\n    [RibbonTab(\"ID_CustomTab_1\", DisplayName = \"X\", LoadForCanExecute\
    \ = true )]\n    [Command(\"ID_Button_1\", Icon = \"uno.ico\", LargeIcon = \"\
    uno.ico\", ToolTip = \"Show a message\")]\n\nAnd Ribbon Tab \"X\" does not even\
    \ apear at Navisworks UI! But if I change the Display Name at the Plugin declaration,\
    \ the display of the button changes. I already connected the Roamer.exe and placed\
    \ the correct path. And I don't know what else to do in order to continue.\n\n\
    My ultimate goal is to change the \"Tool add/ins 1\" and the icon of the Plugin.\
    \ \n\nAny ideas?\n\nRegards in advance"

    Neither metacharacters like \n or  nor "real" linefeeds do work.

    Does anyone have a solution to this?


    Is there any reference documentation for ALL features of the custom ribbon handling?


    Thanks
