  body: When using this method is it also possible to debug the program. When i'm
    testing and altering something I now have to close Navisworks and Restart it.
    It would be much quicker to just reload the plugin and debug it then.

  body: 'Thanks for the great article! How can I use this to test my code without
    having to restart Navisworks every time I change my "BasicPlugIn_LoadTest"?

    Now after the new assembly is loaded in Navis I cannot overwrite it while building
    the new one from Visual Studio..


    Is there such a way to unload a plugin/assembly?


    Thanks!'
