    Thanks for your post. I need to create nwc file using api to appending SAT (Acis)
    files. After append, I need attach Custom properties for each entity and after
    that,I need to build a Custom selection tree based in some custom properties.
    Is possible to do it just using API? Do you have suggestions? My SAT files have
    typically 130.000 entities.
