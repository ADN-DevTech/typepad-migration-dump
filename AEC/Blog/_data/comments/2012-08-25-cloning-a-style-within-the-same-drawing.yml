  body: "Just a small follow up - \n\nIf you are looking for a specific class and\
    \ method, one way to find out is to search in the documentation. There must be\
    \ a chm file called acamgd.chm in the product install. Using that, search, for\
    \ example, DictionaryMemberStyle. In the class description page, you will find\
    \ namespace and assembly name the class/methods are defined.  \n-----"
