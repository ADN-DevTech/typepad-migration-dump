  body: "Hi John,\n\nI assume you have read the other two blogs about ActiveX control.\
    \ \n<a href=\"http://adndevblog.typepad.com/aec/2012/05/navisworks-activex-controls.html\"\
    >http://adndevblog.typepad.com/aec/2012/05/navisworks-activex-controls.html</a>\n\
    <a href=\"http://adndevblog.typepad.com/aec/2012/05/web-server-with-navisworks-activex-control.html\"\
    >http://adndevblog.typepad.com/aec/2012/05/web-server-with-navisworks-activex-control.html</a>\n\
    \nThe Trouble shooting section in the second blog tells what version of IE is\
    \ needed. In short: Redistributable control of 32bit and 64bit can both be installed\
    \ on 64bit OS side by side. The Navisworks ActiveX Redistributable Setup.exe in\
    \ 64bit Navisworks provides the 64bit   Redistributable control. So to open it\
    \ , it requires IE-64bit.\n\nDoes this make sense?"

    Thanks for your help, I finally got it working.  One other thing, can you direct
    me to a place where I can find out how to create a web link from an element within
    the nwd file.


    thanks,
