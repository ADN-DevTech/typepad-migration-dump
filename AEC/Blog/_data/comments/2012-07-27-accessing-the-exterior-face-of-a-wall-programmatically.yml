  body: "Thank you for this, Saikat. Using HostObjectUtils is certainly much less\
    \ error prone than the other methods of determining exterior facing planes.\n\n\
    On that note, however, how would one get the exterior plane of a Roof element\
    \ for example? In my case I had to grab the elements using the FilteredElementCollector\
    \ to get elements of Category BuiltInCategory.OST_Roofs -- this grabs individual\
    \ Roof elements (even those that are custom made) and not RoofBase objects (which\
    \ would be usable in the HostObjectUtils class. Like so:\n\n var roofs = new FilteredElementCollector(this.doc)\n\
    \                .OfCategory(BuiltInCategory.OST_Roofs)\n                .WhereElementIsNotElementType()\n\
    \                .ToList();\n\nGiven that list of Roof Elements, how would one\
    \ determine the exterior face (facing the sky) planes?\n\nThanks for your help\
    \ in advance!"

  body: 'How could I dimension with a line based element, for example ductwork or
    a pipe. It works for the centerline, but if I want to dimension to one edge of
    the element, how could I do that?.

    Thanks a lot.


    Note:

    -Whitout creating another element becouse I will lost the reference and the dimension
    doesn’t update if I move the Ductwork or pipe, maybe if there is a way to restrain
    (lock) one line to the element with dynamo, please let me know How.'
