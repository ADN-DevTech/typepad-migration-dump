  body: 'Hi Namit


    For the elevation views, the rotation axis should be vertical (z axis). You can
    create a new line which is vertical and located on a specific location in the
    elevation view and use this as the rotation axis.


    The Location.Rotate() in the Revit API chm file contains a code snippet which
    creates a vertical axis too - you can refer to that.


    cheers
