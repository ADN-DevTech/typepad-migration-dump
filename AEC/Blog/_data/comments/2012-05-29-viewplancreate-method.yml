  body: "Hi, sorry for resurrecting this post, but I am wondering where you get the\
    \ level ID from. \nI try to make a view from a scopebox and the scopebocx has\
    \ a LevelId property, but I can't select the level of a scopebox in the Revit\
    \ UI. If I try to use the LevelId from the scopebox I get a warning that that\
    \ Id is not a Level Element. \nThanks in advance\n-----"
