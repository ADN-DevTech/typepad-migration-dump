  body: 'Hi


    my comment has nothing to do with the posting, but I did not find another way
    to contact you ...


    The url <a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/">http://adndevblog.typepad.com/</a>
    shows directly this AEC page, which is displayed under <a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/">http://adndevblog.typepad.com/</a>
    and under <a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/aec.">http://adndevblog.typepad.com/aec.</a>
    Only on the lower rights side of the blog are other blogs listed.


    It would be fine if <a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/">http://adndevblog.typepad.com/</a>
    directly displays a list of all blogs and not only the AEC block.


    Thanks and best regards


    Peter'
