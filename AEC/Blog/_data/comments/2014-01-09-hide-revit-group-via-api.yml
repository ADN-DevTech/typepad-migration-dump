  body: 'Hi Joe,


    Can you please show me how to implement a Revit add-in that can ''talk'' to an
    opened dwg file in an AutoCAD session? or an AutoCAD add-in that can drive Revit
    to do something?


    What I am trying to do is to read dwg lines data, from a specific layer, and send
    end points coordinate to Revit to create beams.


    Thank you very much.

  body: 'Hi Jacob,


    why not exchange the data by using a file ?

    No need to drive any program from outside.


    Just create an AutoCAD plugin which exports your points, e.g. into a xml file.


    Also create a Revit plugin which imports that files and creates objects.


    The xml format may be written by yourself.

    Just search for "XML serialization".


    This xml stuff may be defined in a common class library which will be referenced
    by both of your addins.



    Best regards,
