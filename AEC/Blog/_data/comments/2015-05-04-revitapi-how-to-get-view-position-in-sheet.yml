  body: 'Hi Aaron,


    Nice article.  I''ve been trying to do some stuff with arranging viewports on
    the sheet and when programmatically creating them, the viewport can wind up with
    any (seemingly random) size relative to the geometry.  Is there a way to get the
    outline of the geometry in the viewport in sheet coordinates?'
