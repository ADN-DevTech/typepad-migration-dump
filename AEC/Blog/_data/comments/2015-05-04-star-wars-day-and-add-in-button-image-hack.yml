  body: I feel like this is an issue that Mikako and I ran into some years ago- might
    even be on the blog somewhere. I feel like the issue was that you have to save
    the image with a nominal DPI setting that matches Revit's expectation.

  body: For Revit, you need to supply a 96 dpi image. The app_32.png is at 300 dpi.
    And you need to always supply a small image because if you don't and the user
    move the button to the quick access bar, it will result in a blank icon.

    \nAs Maxence rightly pointed out, it uses 96 as the default dpi."
