  body: "Dear Mr liang\n   I have a problem， I set up a response function to an event，\
    \ but in this function, it triggered this event again ,it caused my program crash。Is\
    \ there any way to not triggered （ex：not send the event message）in my function？\n\
    \   this is my code\n               Autodesk.Navisworks.Api.Application.ActiveDocument.CurrentSelection.Changed\

  body: "Hello. Although this is a question that has been asked for many years ago,nut\
    \ I answer it for other people who may have this question. \nI think the code\
    \ should be changed like this: when the event happens, you need to delete callback\
    \ from events, and after adding an item to the selection, add it back to the event:\n\
    \nAutodesk.Navisworks.Api.Application.ActiveDocument.CurrentSelection.Changed\
    \ += \n    new EventHandler(CurrentSlection_changed);\n\nprivate void CurrentSlection_changed(object\
    \ sender , EventArgs e)\n{\n    // delete your call back from event\n    Autodesk.Navisworks.Api.Application.ActiveDocument.CurrentSelection.Changed\
    \ -= new \n        EventHandler(CurrentSlection_changed);\n    // adding items\
    \ to your selection\n    Autodesk.Navisworks.Api.Application.ActiveDocument.CurrentSelection.Add(fatherItem);\n\
    \n    // add it back to the event\n    Autodesk.Navisworks.Api.Application.ActiveDocument.CurrentSelection.Changed\
    \ += \n        new EventHandler(CurrentSlection_changed);\n}\n-----"
