  body: It is not always clear as to which product the article refers (NW, Revit,
    etc). I'd suggest an opening comment so we don't need to sleuth the code... Compliments
    on a very helpful blog. Dale

  body: "Hi Dale,\n\nThanks for the suggestion. At the bottom of each post, we added\
    \ the catalog of the product and some other  catalogs. Does this help you?\n\n\
    In addition, sometimes I also need to search the blogs. What I did is to input\
    \ the key words (e.g. \"Navisworks delete\") and search. It works to me so far,\
    \ though I do not know  if there is a better trick. \n\nRegards,\nXiaodong"

  body: 'That was my very next guess ;) I originally posted that question to the forum.
    Thank you for the answer. Providing a link to this blog post as a response would
    have notified me and provided anyone else who came across my post the answer.

    Yea, this isn''t light reading. If i''m here it''s generally because I searched
    your blog or google brought me here. I would know exactly what I was reading pertained
    too. The catalog at the bottom is a bonus. And the ''you also might like'' are
    great when I am just killing time. Thank you!!!'

  body: 'oops, i apologize, you did leave a link to this blog in my post. I must have
    forgot to subscribe. I really appreciate you answering question right from the
    forum! For a long time there seemed to be very little involvement from Autodesk
    employees. I think it''s fantastic!
