    Only Autodesk documentation mentioning this of course is the API Reference Manual,
    but an example can be found in the api net examples...

    While in .NET API, it is AddGroup, as shown in the two posts I enclosed in the
    last reply.'

    Good to know since I''m try to avoid COM.  Thank you for your quick replies.

  body: 'Hello Xiaodong Liang,


    Does your code could be applied for excel VBA ? For example, is it possible to
    do a search in naviswork with vba.


    My purpose is to open naviswork in a first step (I can do it) and in a second
    step to find an item via what you call “Find Items functionality in Roamer”.


    Best regards,


    Diego,'

  body: "Hi Diego,\n\n.net API cannot be used in vba which is COM based.  Navisworks\
    \ also provides COM API which has find ability. You can get started with it by\
    \ the sdk sample actx_05(before 2013) which is written in vb6. From 2013 this\
    \ sample is written in c#, but the basic principal is still same. \nIn your case,\
    \ you can either start a Navisworks instance by COM API, open model and use find\
    \ API. Or embed an activex control in your app of excel vba, and use find API.\n\
    \nRegards,\nXiaodong"

    I have read about the sample "sdk sample actx_05" but I cannot find it. Do you
    have an Idea how could I get it? I''m pretty sure this could help me!


    By now, I know how to select everything, and how to change the background... However
    this is not going to help me!

  body: 'You are my hero. Once I recoded your example here in VBA, I learned lots
    - in fact I learned that "Item" (instead of Entity Name) means - don''t set a

    Here is a link for an example for anyone looking for "Item"->"Name"->"Value" and
    how, using VBA (or VBScript for that matter) to do that. It was all inspired by

  body: Xiaodong is quite correct. If you are ripping your hair out like I was, see
    my example below of a working VBA example and how you can figure out all sorts
    of custom finds as a result. This is the key article to unlocking how all the
    gears mesh together.
