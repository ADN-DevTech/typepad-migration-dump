  body: 'Hi Augusto, I believe that it is still not possible to truly delete a Shared
    Parameter (i.e. including the internal GUID). To test the above code: Add a shared
    Parameter, delete Shared Parameter from the family (as above), rename the Shared
    Parameter in the txt file (keep old GUID), add the new Shared Parameter. The new
    Parameter will have the name of the deleted parameter, not the new name. If you
    can come up with an example to rename a shared Parameter you will become the Grande
    Poobah of Revit API support. Regards, Dale'
