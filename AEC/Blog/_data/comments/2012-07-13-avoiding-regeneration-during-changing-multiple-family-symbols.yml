  body: 'Can you please give an example of how to properly use this method? It looks
    like it needs an Element and then it can be called on a whole set of element Ids,
    but when i use a single element and call it with three arguments (doc, elementids,
    typeid) i get an error that it only requires one argument and i am supplying three.
    this comes from the fact that there is another method with the exact same name
    that needs just one argument (typeid) and can be called on a single element. What
    am I doing wrong? How can I change type of multiple elements at once? Can you
    provide an example? Thank you in advance! -Konrad
