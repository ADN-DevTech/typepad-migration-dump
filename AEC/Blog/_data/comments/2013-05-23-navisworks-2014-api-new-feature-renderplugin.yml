  body: 'This is really a cool new feature, however, several things have changed in
    NW2015 and it no longer seems to work properly:

    - it''s no longer derived from ToolPlugin but directly from Plugin

    - there''s now only two functions: Render and OverlayRender

    - OverlayRender no longer seems to produce any visible graphics

    - Render seems to work like OverlayRender did previously, but only while debugging;
    when running NW2015 normally, the graphics pop up shortly then directly disappear
    again


    to summarize: what''s up?! How do I fix my code?'

  body: 'Thanks for the article. I just tried this in Navisworks 2018 and was able
    to make some progress so I can clarify on Michael''s questions.


    OverlayRender now seems to work in screen space, replacing BeginWindowContext-EndWindowContext.


    Render works for me, but does have some issues with the camera near clipping distance,
    so geometry that is outside the bounding box of the existing loaded models gets
    cut off depending on the camera angle.'

    Did you have any luck with it? I am having the same issue renderig geometries.
    As soon as I stop moving the camera, they disappear.


    There is little to none information in regards to RenderPlugin class.'

    You can test by removing your IF condition.

    If you want to keep your "counter_graphic", you have to save each geometries into
    a list and redraw each element in render method.'
