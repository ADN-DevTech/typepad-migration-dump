  body: 'Hi Saikat,


    is it possible to get a diagram of the whole Revit API ?


    I know that the API became huge over the years, but perhaps Autodesk itself already
    has something like this for internal purposes, so it would be only a little step
    to bring such a chart to the public...



    Best regards,


    Rudolf'

  body: "Hi Rudolf\n\nThere isnt any diagram of the whole of Revit API. And as much\
    \ as I know, there isnt any such diagram that is used internally either. \n\n\
    At the most, you can open up the Namespaces in Class View on the referenced Revit\
    \ API dlls inside Visual Studio, and then click on View Class Diagram button.\
    \ Doing this step by step assembles a partial class diagram for you.\n\nSorry\
    \ about this,\ncheers\nSaikat\n-----"
