    This is a very useful post and works well.  Can you tell me if it would be possible
    to display this Property data in a DockPane plugin, each time you select a new
    item?  I can see how to do it with an extra button press after the new select
    but I am trying to avoid that extra button press.'

    I want to extract properties from BIM models with Navisworks 2015. I think your
    post is very useful but the first sentence (Document oDoc = Autodesk.Navisworks.Api.Application.ActiveDocument;)
    returns null. I am new to Navisworks and could you tell me the reason? Looking
    forward to hearing from you. Thanks'
