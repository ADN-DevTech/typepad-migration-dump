    I’m the Community Manager with Anagram Interactive, where we specialize in connecting
    established brands with prominent bloggers. We’re currently working with Paperless
    Post, a company that designs customizable online and printed stationery, to show
    that communication can be personal and well-designed regardless of the medium.


    Paperless Post has partnered with several world-famous designers and lifestyle
    brands, including kate spade new york, Oscar de la Renta, Jonathan Adler, and
    Rifle Paper Co., and has delivered over 85 million cards to date. Since you have
    such an engaging and beautifully-designed blog, we’d like to offer you 800 Paperless
    Post digital Coins (a $80 value) for free to try out our online service and write
    about your experience.


    We really think you’ll enjoy Paperless Post and can’t wait to hear what you think.
    Please let me know if this is something you’d be interested in and I’ll show you
    how to get started.


    Best,

    Helen
