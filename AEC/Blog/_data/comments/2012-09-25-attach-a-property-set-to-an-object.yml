    From where can we nab (obtain) "Utils.findStyle(dictPropSetDef, propSetDefName)"
    ?

    Thanks in advance!'

  body: "Could you try PropertyDataServices.GetPropertySetDefinitionsUsed(DBObject)?\
    \ (I don't recall seeing utilities like those we see in .NET while I was using\
    \ OMF. So I cannot tell from the top of my head.  But the name sounds like the\
    \ one.)   \n\nAnd here is some more info.  When a property set is attached to\
    \ an object, it is saved in the object's extension dictionary called AEC_PROPERTY_SETS.\
    \ You can check the property set definition name. \n\nYou can actually check these\
    \ yourself using a tool MgdDbgAec posted earlier: \n<a href=\"http://adndevblog.typepad.com/aec/2012/08/flat-migrated-mgddbgaec.html\"\
    >http://adndevblog.typepad.com/aec/2012/08/flat-migrated-mgddbgaec.html</a> \n\
    If the above method does not work, you can actually check the extension dictionary.\
    \  \n\nI hope this helps."

  body: 'Hello Mikako,

    which assembly contains the class "AecDb.Dictionary" that you used in the first
    parameter of your function "findstyle"?

    I''m trying to compile your code and get into some problems with the classes and
    namespaces. Could you show me the Imports Statements and the References that you
    added for this sample code?

    Thank you for your assistance.
