  body: Just FYI but setting an AttachmentPoint is not required.  If none are specified
    the Label will be placed at the center point of the selection's bounding box.

  body: Is there a way not to use "override"? This way of adding hyperlinks seems
    to override any h-link set before. I would like to add multiple hyperlinks (a
    couple at least) to a model, but with this way the latest addition of a h-link
    overrides earlier additions. I tried to add attachment points to differ the h-links
    but it did not seem to work.

    \ side. It works well. 1 hyperlink and 2 labels. \n\nCould you post on Autodesk\
    \ forum with the model, code you tested with? And a snapshot on the result you\
    \ got. It will help to diagnose what is wrong.\n<a href=\"http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/navisworks-api/bd-p/600\"\

    Actually, there was a bug in the calling method so it was always telling it to
    use labels, not hyperlinks....

    I have a little problem with your code. When I try to run it I see an error: "A
    software problem has caused Navisworks Manage 2017 to close unexpectedly".


    I even don''t know how to check what is the reason of this problem.


    Any idea?


    I used Visual Studio 2015 and Navisworks Manage 2017.'
