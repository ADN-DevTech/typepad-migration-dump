  body: "HI Saikat.\n\nI have done this a different way in my Project Browser App.\n\
    \n Dim schCol As FilteredElementCollector = New FilteredElementCollector(doc,\
    \ sheetView.Id).OfClass(GetType(DB.ScheduleSheetInstance))\n        If schCol.Count\
    \ > 0 Then \n'do you stuff in here\n        End If\n\nThe only issue that I have\
    \ had with this is the creation of the FilteredElementCollector is slow as it\
    \ looks to be opening the sheet view, which if you have 400 sheets in a project\
    \ can take some time.\n\nRegards\nPhillip"

  body: "Thanks for sharing your approach Phillip. \n\nThis looks like a better way\
    \ of doing it - atleast for almost all cases, where there arent so many viewsheets\
    \ to work with in a model. If you happen to see if the faking deletion approach\
    \ is faster, please do share your findings. It will be good to learn from what\
    \ you find.."

  body: "Other Workaround coul be just ask the ScheduleSheetInstance for its sheet\
    \ through the property OwnerViewId;\nI have 500 sheets and only 7 schedules. Goes\
    \ a lot faster:\n\nScheduleSheetInstance vsch = \nviewSchedule as ScheduleSheetInstance;\n\
    ElementId shid = vsch.OwnerViewId;"
