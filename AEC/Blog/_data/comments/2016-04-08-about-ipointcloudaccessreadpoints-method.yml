  body: 'Our engine may prepare more points than that Revit is asking. Revit seems
    to ask the number of pixels and assume that is the maximum points needed. But
    if point cloud engine feeds also points blocked by other points in the view, the
    number may increase substantially. But, because Revit will stop asking, it becomes
    the case that a sparse (or even patchy or mosaic) point display results.


    Is it possible to make Revit fetch more points for rendering. Especially when
    it comes to printing or DWF exporting where we usually expect to increase detail,
    it won''t work at all, because the more points you prepare, the less you actually
    get.'

  body: 'When an engine feeds points in sequence of LODs, it would still stop at any
    number and leaves the display patchy or mosaic.


    When an engine does not order points in LODs, it would end up with totally uneven
    display with missing blocks here and there.


    Also IPointCloudIterator.ReadPoints when calling, does not tell which view is
    requesting the points. This makes it impossible for external point cloud engine
    to update each view with the matching points.
