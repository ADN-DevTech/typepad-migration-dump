  body: 'Which 2 viewpoints does this code move? I want to move a selected viewpoint/viewpoints
    to a specific folder. But Navisworks doesn''t allow us to move more than 2 viewpoints
    from 2 different folders. So I''d like to create plugin which will help move multiple
    viewpoints. Is this possible?
