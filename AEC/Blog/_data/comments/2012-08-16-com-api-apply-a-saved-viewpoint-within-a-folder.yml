    This is parts of code working with all savedpoints, but if i need to get collection
    of selected viewpoints?

    can i do that?

    i can get only one currentSelected viewpoint (last, if is multiselection).

    i think i cant get it by NET, maybe COM can help?

    Thanks.'

  body: 'Hi Sergey,


    yes, CurrentSavedViewpoint tells the last selected view points only. Can I know
    why you want to know the multi-selected items? As I know, only one saved viewpoint
    can be applied to the current view.


    If what you wanted is to do some post work after the user multi-selected the viewpoints,
    I would suggest you create your own panel to manage the viewpoints. Thus you can
    know multi-selected easily.
