    It does not seem like we can add image in a 3D view in Revit using the Revit User
    Interface itself. The image button appears disabled when the active view is a
    3D view. Similarly, I dont think it will be possible to insert an Image in a 3D
    view using the API either. If UI does not support it, in most cases, API will
    not be able to perform the same task either.


    cheers
