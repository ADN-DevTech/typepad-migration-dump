    \ Why is that?\n• Why use ObjectId.IsNull and ObjectId.IsValid alternatively rather\

  body: "Hi Carl, \n\nI'm not familiar with C3D.  But C3D uses AEC Base, too.  So\
    \ theoretically speaking, you may try referencing AEC related managed dlls that\
    \ you can find in C3D install, (not Arch specific ones), then additional C3D specific\
    \ managed dll. If this does not work, then you will need to ask C3D team on forum."
