  body: "Dear Matt, \n\nThank you for the hint. \n\nCan you just elaborate a little?\n\
    \nFor instance, what is the postable command id?\n\nDo you happen to have a sample\
    \ code snippet at hand?\n\nMaybe I could summarise Aarons findings and your comment\
    \ to replace the existing discussions on The Building Coder.\n\nThank you!\n\n\
    Cheers, Jeremy"
