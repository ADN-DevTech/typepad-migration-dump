  body: "Hi Xiaodong,\n\nThanks for your technical blog regarding the Navisworks .NET\
    \ API. My question for you is actually from your PPT regarding the following stated\
    \ information:\n\n\"Known Limitations\n-No Mouse, Keyboard events yet \n Although\
    \ derives from .NET control, these events have not been implemented \n-Some scenarios\
    \ can use  \n OnCurrenSelectionChanging \n OnCurrenSelectionChanged \"\n\nDoes\
    \ it mean I can't use my mouse to manipulate the model for zoom, pan and rotate\
    \ since the model is in the WPF instead of Navisworks itself? If so, do I need\
    \ to input coordinate values using code for the model so that to show different\
    \ angles to view? I hope this is not the truth as it will be very clumsy to apply\
    \ the advantage of this WPF. \n\nHope to receive your clarification.\n\nKind regards\n\
    Wei\n\n-----"
