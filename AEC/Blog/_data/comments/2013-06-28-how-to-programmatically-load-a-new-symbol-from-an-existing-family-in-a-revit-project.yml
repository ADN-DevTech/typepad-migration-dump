  body: "Hello Gopinath,\n\nWhat does document.LoadFamilySymbol(familyFile, symbolName,\
    \ new FamilyOption(), out gotSymbol) do when a FamilySymbol is already loaded\
    \ and is unchanged ? Does it load it again from disk and overwrite the current\
    \ FamilySymbol, or does it skip the loading as it is already there ? \n\nAnd secondly,\
    \ if it does skip the loading in this case, can I leave out the (time consuming)\
    \ checking for loaded Families and FamilySymbols before calling document.LoadFamilySymbol()\
    \ and let this method sort that out ?\n-----"
