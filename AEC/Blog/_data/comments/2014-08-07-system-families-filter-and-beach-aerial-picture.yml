  body: Jaime, I am guessing that you are on your honeymoon now, so probably not checking
    your blog (I hope). This worked perfectly thank you. I have to admit to being
    unclear as to how to implement the comment from Revit API Engineering Team, so
    your additional information helped a lot. I will update the original Forum page.
    Regards, Dale
