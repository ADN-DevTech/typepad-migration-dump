  body: "I think that I have found a very bad bug with Independent Tags. \n\nWhen\
    \ a Tag cannot display a parameter value (because the parameter has been renamed\
    \ or removed) Revit displays a '?'\n\nIf you try to read the text of any tag that\
    \ has a '?' Revit completely bombs out.\n\neg. Using Revit2013, Visual Studio\
    \ 2010, VB.net \n Try\n            tagText = aTag.TagText.ToString()\n       \
    \ Catch\n            tagText = \"This One is stuffed\"\n        End Try\n\nThe\
    \ 'Catch' above cannot be caught if its a bad TagText - it completely bombs out....\n\
    \nEven when using 'Revit Lookup' / 'Snoop DB', when it encounters an Independent\
    \ Tag that has a '?' it completely bombs out and quits.\n\nRegards,\nKon."

  body: 'Hi Saikat,


    I''m loading a floor tag using api (document.loadfamily)

    regenerating the model

    but Revit doesn''t want to use it: e.g.

    in user interface: Tag all recognize it, but tag by category says: no tag is loaded!!


    (using newtag method -in a new transaction after regenerating- also throws an
    exception that no tag is loaded!)


    thanks & regards
