  body: I have used code like this with success in the past for adding a body modifier
    to a wall.  I have tried the same technique for adding geometry to a duct fitting
    after it has been placed in the model with absolutely no success.  Is there a
    way using a similiar technique to add geometry to catalog based parts in Autocad
    MEP?  The content builder does not allow for certain scenarios and being able
    to add the geometry at run time would help fix this drawback with the Content
    Builder.
