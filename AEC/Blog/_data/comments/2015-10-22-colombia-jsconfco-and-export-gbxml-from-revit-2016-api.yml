  body: 'Hello,


    Actually I am not a programmer and I don''t know how to convert this codes correctly
    in python. I just wonder if it could be possible to have this code in .py too?
    I would like to try it in dynamo with python script nodes.


    I appreciate your time and help.


    Regards,

    Raha'
