  body: "Hi.\nI tried this plugin with Navisworks 2014, but most of the functions\
    \ don't seem to work(it crash navisworks). \n\nI managed to be able to create\
    \ a plugin that move the position of the camera by typing values, using the same\
    \ method of copying the current viewpoint, but whenever I try to manipulate the\
    \ rotation, it crashes too, despite all the references to the API being detected\
    \ as valid in Visual studio."
