  body: "Hi Xiaodong, \n\nI just follow your post and get your solution file down\
    \ hoping i could create a custom tab to host custom buttons. However, it doesn't\
    \ work. I am using navisworks 2018 sdk. and the error i get is \"NWRibbonButton\
    \ doesnot exist in gui.roamer\". Do you have any hint? I just need to creat very\
    \ simple tab. Don't need to have the fancy switch in there. If there any other\
    \ tutorial i could refer to as well?"

  body: 'Hi Xiaoxuan,

    probably this sample will need to be updated. Please use SDK sample CustomRibbon.
    It works well at my side. By that sample, you could check which is missing or
    updated in the new releases. As far as I know, no change, but in case something
    I do not know.'

  body: 'Hello,


    Is it possible to customize the Ribbon Tab and the buttons of a class derived
    of AddInPlugin  instead of a  CommandHandlerPlugin?


    Reference:

    public class DumpTimelinerTasks : AddInPlugin


    The question is because I need to perform some tasks that can only be done in
    AddInPlugin but the Ribbon Tab and buttons don''t seem to change as they do when
    the class derives from CommandHandlerPlugin.


    Need an answer and best regards'
