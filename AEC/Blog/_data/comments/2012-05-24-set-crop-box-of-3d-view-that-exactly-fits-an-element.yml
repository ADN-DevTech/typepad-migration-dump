  body: 'Hello Sir,


    I am trying to achieve something similar to this but with different approach.
    I am trying to fit the CropBox of a view which contains some pipes and fittings.
    I am doing this with the help of JtBoundingBox class. I have achieved this for
    floor plan, but it does not seems working for 3D Views and Section views, what
    I am getting is, the CropBox shape and size is correct but somehow, it lies at
    certain distance away from the exact bunch of elements. I am wondering if this
    issue is linked with JtBoundingBox or not?

    Please suggest.
