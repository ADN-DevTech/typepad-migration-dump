    It''s our own custom format, so the file extension could be anything. We simply
    use the exact file name including extension so that we know from which file the
    geometric information comes from.'

  body: 'Hi Andrew,


    There is not any viewer for developer on mobile currently. So, similarly to what
    Adam shared for Revit, you can get the geometries data from Navisworks model (they
    are a kind of triangles), upload triangles to cloud, and render the data on iOS
    by Open GL yourself.


    The blog below shows how to get triangles of Navisworks object.

    And in Exchange Store of Autodesk, one developer has published an application
    that export Navisworks model and render it in an HTML by WebGL. Hope it could
    help.

    Thanks for your reply.


    I would like to know more about creating viewer for mobile in Unity Framework
    something similar to what revitzo does ?


    is it possible to read a model of Navisworks in mobile using Unity3d framework
    ?


    Thanks
