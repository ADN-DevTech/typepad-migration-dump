    \ slab edge hosted to the slabs.\nIs it possible to split floor slab without losing\
    \ hosted slab edges?\nWill this work for it. I am getting errors while running\
    \ this code. What reference am I missing?\n\n'Autodesk.Revit.DB.Line' does not\
    \ contain a definition for 'GetEndPoint' and no extension method 'GetEndPoint'\
