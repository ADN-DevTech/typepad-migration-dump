  body: "Thanks. The top part of the code runs fine. (before transformation).After\
    \ \"oDoc.CurrentSelection.CopyFrom(items);\"\n\nI am actually looking to print\
    \ the collection in a text file but only the values in the properties of the items.\
    \ Like suppose I only want to print the item (from collection) if it has a property\
    \ category \"Entity Handle\" and contains Property \"Value\", and if its true\
    \ I will print the number contained in Value. \nI am able to write the displaynames,\
    \ boundingbox.min.x etc but how can I write the values of properties?"
