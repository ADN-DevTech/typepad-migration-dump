    I''ve tried using this example but can''t then read the InwSimpleVertex values
    back to usable forms in the Triangle call back. I can see the values in the debugger.
    but can find no way to convert the values to another float variable.

    Do you have the coe to do that?


    Thanks

    Besides GenerateSimplePrimitives, is there other way to get element''s geometries?

    Using GenerateSimplePrimitives is too slow. So I want to find a quicker way to
    get geometries.


    Thanks,

    It is clear that GenerateSimplePrimitives is the only way to get the geometry.  My
    question is, is there a performance difference in using C# via interop or using
    COM natively via C++?  If there is, how much faster is C++? 2x, 5x... ?

    Can you please explain how i get the InwSimpleVertex units in World coördinates
    using the InwLTransform3f created by GetLocalToWorldMatrix?


    Is there a Method that does this or do i have to do this manually?


    Thanks in advance,

    Could you please tell me what the colon is for in this statement


    ''class CallbackGeomListener : COMApi.InwSimplePrimitivesCB"


    & any relevant info regarding creating a similar statement in VB.net


    thanks'

  body: 'Hi All,


    Here is a quick tip,

    The code below returns the objects in Local Coordinates System.

    GenerateSimplePrimitives(nwEVertexProperty.eNORMAL,callbkListener);

    i.e. every objects is shown at the origin of the project.

    If you need world coordinates you will need to convert the coordinates using.

    ComApi.InwLTransform3f3 localToWorld = (ComApi.InwLTransform3f3)(object)frag.GetLocalToWorldMatrix()


    See this blog post for a full working solution. =)

    I''m pretty new with API with no experience with programming.


    I need to get geometry dimensions from Navisworks (piping diameter and length)
    and searching in goolgle I found this topic and I hope you could give a hand.
    Most of my search results leads me to perform a class library in c# using visual
    studio. Unfortunatelly my lack of knowledge doesn''t allow me to do it myself.


    I really appreciate if you could give some directions.


    thanks!'
