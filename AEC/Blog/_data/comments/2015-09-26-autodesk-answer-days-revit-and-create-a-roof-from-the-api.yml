  body: "We are currently transitioning our projects from Archicad to Revit and have\
    \ encountered a workflow question regarding design options in linked files.\n\
    In Archicad, we use a Unit Plan file containing different design options, which\
    \ is linked to a Main Project file. The Main Project file can then utilize the\
    \ design options from the linked Unit Plan.\nWhile we know Revit allows linking\
    \ files, we understand that design options in a linked Revit file cannot be directly\
    \ accessed or controlled in the host file.\n \nOur query:\n•\tIs there a solution\
    \ or workaround in Revit to replicate this functionality (e.g., using worksets,\
    \ filters, or third-party tools)?\n•\tIf yes, we’d like to schedule a consultation\
    \ session to discuss the approach and implementation.\n\n-----"
