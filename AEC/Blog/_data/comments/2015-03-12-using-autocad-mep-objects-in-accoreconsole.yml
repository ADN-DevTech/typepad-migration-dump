  body: I tried this on two machines... both with AutoCAD MEP 2014. One machine didn't
    recognize the mvBlock. The other one did. I checked DemandLoad variable... and
    believe this was the issue. I will test this.

  body: I think I found the issue... DEMANDLOAD was set to 1. According to help though..
    a setting of 1 should have helped.

  body: Alas... DEMANDLOAD 3 does not help. Does DEMANDLOAD have to be set before
    the drawing is loaded? It must be something with the profile?

  body: "Hi Mike,\n\nDEMANDLOAD set to 3 should be good enough for it to load the\

  body: "Hi Mike,\n\nWith DEMANDLOAD set to 3 (default) in AutoCAD MEP 2014, the core\
    \ console did load the enablers in my system. The MVBlock ref could also be moved\
    \ with the script that you shared.\n\nIn the sample files that you shared, i find\
    \ the /isolate switch being used. Can you try without that ? \n\nAlso since you\
    \ mentioned that the behavior was system specific, I would suggest comparing the\
    \ LOADCTRLS value for the enablers under : HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Autodesk\\\
    ObjectDBX\\R19.1\\Applications. Each dbx shoud have a LOADCTRL value with its\
    \ first and fourth bit set for it load on proxy detection. The ObjectARX developer\
    \ guide explains the relevance of each bit. \n\nRegards,\nBalaji\n\n-----"
