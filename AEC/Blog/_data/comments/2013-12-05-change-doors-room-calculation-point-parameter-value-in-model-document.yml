  body: 'hi joe,


    looks like familyDoc.LoadFamily(doc, new familyOverride()); won''t invoke familyOverride()
    afterall.


    quot from spiderinnet:

    In the Revit API 2014, the IFamilyLoadOptions continually does not work well together
    with the signatures of both LoadFamily and LoadFamilySymbol methods having the
    interface specified as an argument.


    cheers,

  body: 'Hi Ning,


    According to my experience, LoadFamily() and LoadFamilySymbol() can work well
    with the override of the signature with IFamilyLoadOptions for both Revit 2013,
    and Revit 2014. It can invoke the code in the IFamilyLoadOptions''s derived class.

    But one exception: if your family file was created with the Revit 2013 template,
    these two override cannot load the family  document.  Please check if your family
    file was created with the Revit 2013 family template.

    Seems like this line at the end isn''t needed :


    Transaction transLoc = new Transaction(doc);


    Anyways, thanks for the help.'
