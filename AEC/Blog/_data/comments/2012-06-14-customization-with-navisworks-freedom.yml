  body: "Thanks for this post. I am trying to create a windows forms application hosting\
    \ the Navisworks Control. I am looking into the API documentation for Control\
    \ namespace. \n\nI intend to support the product through an install of Navisworks\
    \ Freedom. However, I want to understand the flexibility in terms of what I can\
    \ do. For example, using just a freedom install can I do things like query the\
    \ objects in the model, their properties, change colors of objects etc. Thanks"

    \ only. From NW 2012, Freedom does not support .NET control, but API overlooked\
    \ removing the constant RuntimeNames.NavisworksFreedom. From NW 2013 this constant\
    \ is removed. And API help indicates: \n\n\"System Requirements \nIn addition\
    \ to the minimum system requirements of Navisworks; developers will need Navisworks\
    \ Simulate or Manage to be installed. No form of .Net API (plugin or controls)\
    \ will be supported for Freedom.\"\n-----"
