  body: 'Hi Saikat,


    I''ve found that you have to close the document after extracting the path. If
    you do not, you will be asked to save each family when you quit Revit.


    // Close the document

    famDoc.Close(false);'

  body: 'Hi Saikat,


    I need to perform an EditFamily() on a family element by selecting it in a legend.


    In other words, I want my code to allow the user to click on a family already
    inserted in a legend, then edit that family for extracting some information before
    closing it back.


    Can you help me with this, please?

  body: "Hi guys, I am trying to find some info on families and templates. The company\
    \ has different offices with different servers. When our office works on the server\
    \ in the head office the time to open files and run program's is very slow due\
    \ to poor band width. I want to know if we take their families and templates and\
    \ copy them over to our office server will they still reference the head office\
    \ server and if so can I easily repath the families and template to run them on\
    \ our server. Any help would be great. \nKenny"
