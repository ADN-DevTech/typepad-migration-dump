  body: 'Hi,


    Thanks for the post. I have a question which is somehow related to this question.
    I need to get the exterior face of wall. I have a "Generic Family on Face" and
    I want to attach it to the face of a wall using Revit API. I was wondering how
    I can access just the exterior face of a wall?


    I modified the the code in this answer but it gives me all faces of wall or any
    other objects/instances.


    Can you please help me.'

  body: "Dear Mohanmmand Rahmani asl,\n\nThere is a very useful and simple method\
    \ to get the side faces from a wall. \n  \n  HostObjectUtils.GetSideFaces(\n \
    \ \tHostObject hostObject,\n\tShellLayerType side\n  )\n\nPass in the target wall,\
    \ this method returns all the side faces. Then you can iterate all faces to find\
    \ your target face via the face normal or other criteria.\n\nEnjoy it.\n\nJoe\n\
