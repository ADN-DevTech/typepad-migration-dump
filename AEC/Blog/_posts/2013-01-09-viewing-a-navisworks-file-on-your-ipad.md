<p>Many of you probably heard about <a href="http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/pc/index?id=19729180&amp;siteID=123112" target="_self" title="BIM 360">BIM 360 Glue </a>by now.&#0160;It has an&#0160;<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/autodesk-bim-360-glue/id554629830?mt=8" target="_self" title="BIM 360 Glue iPad App">iPad application</a>. Being able to view and manipulate a model with your finger tips on your mobile device is&#0160;truly break through.&#0160;One tip that I learned from my colleague in Japan is that if you have&#0160;BIM 360 Glue iPad application installed, you can open a Navisworks nwd file attached to your e-mail&#0160;in your iPad.&#0160;(I must confess that our Navisworks API liaisons did told me about this viewer capability, but I wasn&#39;t simply getting it.)&#0160; </p>
<p>After you install BIM 360 Glue mobile app for iPad,&#0160;if you tap nwd file, you will see an icon to open&#0160;it in BIM 360 Glue (image below): </p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/.a/6a0167607c2431970b017ee7291a94970d-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Glue1a" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0167607c2431970b017ee7291a94970d" src="/assets/image_841575.jpg" title="Glue1a" /></a></p>
<p>You can then view it in the Glue app, and use your fingers to&#0160;scale, rotate and&#0160;zoom in/out. You can also view properties and use&#0160;the measuring tool.&#0160;Below show a sample image of using measure tool: &#0160;</p>

For more information, I refer to an article on the&#0160;<a href="http://beyonddesign.typepad.com/posts/2012/10/bim-360-glue-on-the-go.html" target="_self" title="BIM 360 Glue on the go">Beyond Design </a>blog. </p>
