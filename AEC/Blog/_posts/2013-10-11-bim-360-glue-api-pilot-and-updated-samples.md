<p>As mentioned in the <a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/aec/2013/05/a-new-glue-new-look-and-30-day-free-trial.html" target="_self" title="A New Glue, New Look, and 30-day Free Trial!">previous post</a>, <a href="http://www.autodesk.com/bim360glue" target="_self" title="BIM 360 Glue">BIM 360 Glue</a> has API. However, the access to the development environment is pretty limited at a moment. You can try the product itself, using <a href="https://b4.autodesk.com/freetrial/" target="_self" title="BIM 360 Glue free trial ">the trial version</a>. But it does not include development environment. Because of this reason, I hesitated to write about Glue API openly here on AEC DevBlog till now. I thought it might frustrate you while you don&#39;t have an access. At the same time, I have been continuously receiving inquiries about it. I finally changed my mind and thought I would update and clarify the current status here. &#0160;</p>
<p>In order to use the API, you will first need to be a member of ADN (ADN Professional or Standard) and need to be a part of a Glue API ADN pilot program. Autodesk is actively working on a way to widen the accessibility. In a mean time, if you are not the ADN member (Standard or Professional) and interested in developing a cloud and mobile solution using the Glue API, please contact ADN: <a href="www.autodesk.com/joinadn" target="_self" title="Join ADN">www.autodesk.com/joinadn</a></p>
<p>If you are ADN member, you can submit a proposal to request to join the ADN Glue API pilot. Please contact us with the information below
through DevHelp Online with the title “<strong>BIM 360 Glue - interested in pilot
program</strong>” including your:</p>
<ul>
<li>Company name</li>
<li>Main contact person’s name</li>
<li>E-mail address</li>
<li>ADN Developer ID</li>
<li>Company URL</li>
<li>Brief description of intention</li>
</ul>
<p>The last item, brief description of intention, is very important as we (ADN and Glue product team) will be using to evaluate the feasibility and advice you for the right timing to start. (For example, if what you are trying to do is obviously beyond the capability of what API offer at a moment, it may not make sense for the product team to support it.) We also expect your active participation after joining the pilot; i.e., testing API, giving us feedback, updating status, showing the demo of prototype, for example. We also keep the right to limit the number of participants at this stage due to the limited resources to support it.</p>
<p>Lastly, but not least, if you are a member of pilot, here is the link to the updated samples:&#0160;<span class="asset  asset-generic at-xid-6a0167607c2431970b019affee2eca970d"><a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/files/glue-api-samples.zip">Download Glue API Samples</a></span>. (The original versions are found in the <a href="https://b4.autodesk.com/api/doc/index.shtml" target="_self" title="Glue API SDK">Glue SDK page&#0160;here</a>). They are migrated to work with the viewer in Glue 2.&#0160;</p>
<p>We are truly looking forward to seeing exciting and creative usage of Glue API! &#0160;</p>
