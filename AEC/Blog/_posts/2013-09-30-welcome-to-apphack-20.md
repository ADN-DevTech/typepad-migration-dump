<p>APPHACK 2.0 is a virtual code-fest to produce apps and plug-ins for AutoCAD, Revit, Inventor and BIM 360 Glue. The theme of the event is <i>Connecting Autodesk to the Cloud</i> &ndash; and <strong>is open to creative interpretation</strong>. Perhaps you can think of a way to wire our software into your favorite social media network or make use of infinite cloud computing to carry out CPU-intensive tasks. Or maybe you have a way to help users better visualize and share their ideas using a web browser. Build a standalone app for an AutoCAD, Revit, Inventor or a BIM 360 Glue product. Or build an app that takes advantage of the integration capabilities of BIM 360 Glue with either of the three other AutoCAD, Revit or Inventor product families. It’s up to you. Code a new app, finish coding one you already have in progress or submit one you already have but haven’t published yet.</p>
<p>More details about the event are provided by the
