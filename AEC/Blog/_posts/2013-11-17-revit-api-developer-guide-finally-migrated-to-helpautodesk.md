<p>I&#39;m happy to inform you that finally Revit API Developer Guide has migrated to help.autodesk.com.</p>
<p>Here is the direct link:<br /><a href="http://help.autodesk.com/view/RVT/2014/ENU/?guid=GUID-F0A122E0-E556-4D0D-9D0F-7E72A9315A42">http://help.autodesk.com/view/RVT/2014/ENU/?guid=GUID-F0A122E0-E556-4D0D-9D0F-7E72A9315A42</a></p>
<p>Here is the marketing URL:&#0160;<br /><a href="http://www.autodesk.com/revit-2014-api-guide-enu" target="_self" title="http://www.autodesk.com/revit-2014-api-guide-enu">http://www.autodesk.com/revit-2014-api-guide-enu</a></p>
<p>Here is the link to the Revit documentation:<br /><a href="http://help.autodesk.com/view/RVT/2014/ENU/" target="_self" title="http://help.autodesk.com/view/RVT/2014/ENU/">http://help.autodesk.com/view/RVT/2014/ENU/</a></p>
<p>I did some review while it was still on staging and reported a few issues and they are fixed. &#0160;I hope it is in a good shape now. &#0160;</p>
<p>Many thanks for your patience and understanding while we are moving to the new system.</p>
