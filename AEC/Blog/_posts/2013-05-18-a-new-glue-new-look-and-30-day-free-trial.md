<p>We are excited to let you know that a major new release of Autodesk® BIM 360™ Glue® is available now:</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/.a/6a0167607c2431970b017eeb4f8378970d-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="BIM 360 Glue Image3" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0167607c2431970b017eeb4f8378970d image-full" src="/assets/image_787679.jpg" title="BIM 360 Glue Image3" /></a></p>
<p>BIM 360 Glue (the Glue) is a cloud-based, BIM Management solution that facilitates multidiscipline model coordination and collaboration. It provides all project members with access to the most up-to-date project models and data from anywhere anytime. You can upload models from Autodesk Navisworks®, Revit®, AutoCAD® and Civil 3D®, and literally “glue” them together up in the cloud. Now with the new UI, it will be more intuitive for you to use. For more detail, please&#0160;refere to&#0160;the&#0160;<a href="http://www.autodesk.com/bim360glue%20" target="_self" title="BIM 360 Glue">BIM 360 Glue product page</a>. &#0160;</p>

<p>I must also add; if you haven’t tried iPad app, please make sure you try “Immersive View”, too. &#0160;The walk through experience using iPad app is just a different user experience that you must know. </p>
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong> Access to the Glue platform through the API, or a development environment, is not a part of this product trial environment at this stage. In order to use the API, you will first need to a member of ADN (ADN Professional or Standard) and need to be a part of a Glue API ADN pilot program. Autodesk is actively working on a way to widen the accessibility. In a mean time, if you are interested developing a cloud and mobile solution using the Glue API, please contact ADN: <a href="http://www.autodesk.com/joinadn">www.autodesk.com/joinadn</a></em></p>
