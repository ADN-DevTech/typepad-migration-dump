<p>Sometime back, I had a honor of presenting at Autodesk University about a tool called &quot;RvtMgdDbg&quot;, which is also known as &quot;Snoop Tool&quot;.&#0160;&quot;Where is the Snoop Tool&quot;&#0160;is yet another inquiry I recieve occasionally.&#0160;It is now renamed as &quot;RevitLookup&quot; and became the part of SDK. Please take a look&#0160;under /RevitLookup/ folder to get this tool. &#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>The tool allows you to explore the internals of Revit database.&#0160;It is&#0160;a great learning tool as well as for&#0160;debugging. It is written using&#0160;only published API.&#0160; So it also&#0160;serves as a sample code. It is originally developed by&#0160;an internal&#0160;team led&#0160;by Jim Awe, and&#0160;Arjun&#0160;Ayyar was&#0160;mainly maintaining it. Currently it is owned by the Revit API&#0160;engineering team. The great tool.&#0160;Must have for any Revit API developers. &#0160;</p>
