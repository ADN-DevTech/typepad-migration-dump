<p>This week I received the visit of my colleague, ADN Manager of Russia, Natalia Polikarpova, and what a busy week we had. First on Tuesday night we attended NY Tech Mixer which hosted Demos and Drinks at Ainsworth Park Bar, A very interested setup for Startups to show and sell the idea of their project to the public in a lighting presentation where they only have 3 minutes to give you a broad idea on what they do, trust me, that is why they call it lighting.</p>
<p>Here is the lineup the Tech meetup had.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://jobsuitors.com/">Jobsuitors</a> - Steve Dean &amp; Andrew Koontharana, Co-founders</strong> <br />Jobsuitors applies the matchmaking power of online dating sites to the hiring space by revealing startups&#39; match % to prospective candidates as well as any major dealbreakers both sides would want to know before making a commitment.</p>
<p><strong><a>XLABS</a> - Oliver Christie, Co-founder</strong> <br />XLABS is a data compression company based in New York and Paris. ​ The world is facing a bandwidth shortage and scientists are endeavoring to find new ways to expand capacity. Elon Musk&#39;s solution is to spend 10 billion dollars building the internet in space to increase speeds. We can solve the world&#39;s bandwidth shortage with our sophisticated data algorithms that allow us to achieve a 99% compression rate, with no data loss. There is no one in the world producing a better compression than us.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.transitory.me/">Transitory</a> - Shaun Salzberg, Founder</strong> <br />Transitory is like the Snapchat of location sharing. It lets you share your whereabouts at a private URL for a set amount of time, which you can then send to as few or as many people as you want. After the time is up, your URL self destructs and can no longer be viewed. Recipients of the private URL don&#39;t need the Transitory app or even a smartphone -- as long as they can view a URL in a browser they can see where you are for the amount of time you allow. Transitory doesn&#39;t require you to create any accounts, is completely anonymous, and completely free.</p>
<p>And after that we were given a couple of ours to mingle with the attendees and evangelize, and of course we talked about View and Data API and the people we got to talk to got very excited about it. Some of them already signed up to try it.&#0160;</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>On Wednesday after enjoying a great early dinner with my colleague, we headed to the Tech in Motion Meetup at the SVA theater where this event presented a panel by NYC Women Transforming Technology, where 3 amazing women currently making history in the tech industry shared their stories and experiences from different fields within the tech industry.</p>

<p>It was definitely a great experience to see so many women enthusiasts and passionate about the computer development world and the many expertise they have in the field.</p>
<p>Next week my traveling spree starts, but first I will present the <a href="http://developer.autodesk.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank">View and Data API</a> at the local <a href="http://www.meetup.com/QueensJS/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">QueensJS Meetup</a> on Wednesday 4th, and then off to my first stop at the <a href="http://aechackathon.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">AEC Hackathon</a> in Chicago, followed by going to the Bay Area for the exciting <a href="http://autodeskcloudaccelerator.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Cloud Accelerator Program</a>, it definitely will be a very exciting month of March.</p>
<p>Thank you for reading until next time.</p>
