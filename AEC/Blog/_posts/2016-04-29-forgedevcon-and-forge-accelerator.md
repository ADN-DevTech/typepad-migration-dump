<p>By Jaime Rosales (<a href="https://twitter.com/AfroJme">@afrojme</a>)</p>  <p>We are only a month and a half away from the first Forge Developer Conference, and things are starting to wrap up nicely with the various tracks, which will target a wide variety of industries for the Future of Making Things enthusiasts. Forge DevCon covers a wide range of class themes for application development in product design and manufacturing. Our team of experts are curating more than 50 classes to help you influence the FOMT, including how to apply disruptive technologies to every part of the design, make, use, and manage lifecycle phases in the manufacturing, engineering, and building industries. This is a great opportunity if you follow in the category of a true Maker.</p>  <p><a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/forge-devcon-2016-tickets-21357894036"><img title="Screen Shot 2016-04-29 at 1.40.31 PM" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="Screen Shot 2016-04-29 at 1.40.31 PM" src="/assets/image_2267.jpg" width="823" height="276" /></a></p>  <p>Here is a list of the tracks and sessions that will make Forge DevCon a memorable experience. </p>  <p><strong>1. Virtual and Augmented Reality</strong></p>  <p>&#160;&#160;&#160; - Tony Parisi (<a href="https://twitter.com/auradeluxe">@auradeluxe</a>), one of the early pioneers of VR will be speaking about an Intro to WebVR.</p>  <p>&#160;&#160;&#160; - Autodesk Researcher and Evangelist, Kean Walmsley (<a href="https://twitter.com/keanw">@Keanw</a>) showing us his latest proyects with Collaborative VR using the cheapest of the VR devices on the market, Google Cardboard. </p>  <p><strong>2. Forge Basic</strong>&#160;</p>  <p>&#160;&#160;&#160; -&#160; A dedicated track to the use of Forge API’s and its various applications to create game changing business for you to explore. Drones, Photogrammetry,&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Design Data and Visual Reporting are some of the topics to discuss. </p>  <p><strong>3. AEC</strong> </p>  <p>&#160;&#160; - A meeting point for people who are concerned with our built environment. Topics in this track include cloud-based collaboration for construction and building management; workflows connecting Building Information Modeling (BIM) with fabrication; and Generative Design, and if you have been working with any of these API’s you probably already know Mikako Harada or Jeremy Tammik (<a href="https://twitter.com/jeremytammik">@jeremytammik</a>)</p>  <p><a href="http://forge.autodesk.com/tracks-and-speakers/">Continue…</a></p>  <p>I could continue talking more in detail about the rest of the tracks, but my post is intended to talk and announce the open call for proposals of the event that will follow DevCon. </p>  <p><a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/.a/6a0167607c2431970b01b7c84dbd78970b-pi"><img title="Screen Shot 2016-04-29 at 2.04.47 PM" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="Screen Shot 2016-04-29 at 2.04.47 PM" src="/assets/image_883506.jpg" width="845" height="199" /></a></p>  <p>As part of our Forge DevCon week, we've scheduled our next Autodesk Forge Accelerator (formerly known as the <a href="http://autodeskcloudaccelerator.com/">Autodesk Cloud Accelerator</a>) for June 19-24 inclusive in our San Francisco office . If your application is accepted, you will spend the week in our office working on your projects that make use of Autodesk Forge APIs - with the help of the ADN DevTech team and members of the Autodesk engineering teams. The Autodesk Forge APIs include the View &amp; Data, AutoCAD I/O, BIM 360, RecCap Photo and Fusion 360 APIs - as well as a number of new APIs that will be launched at the conference. You can find a full list of APIs at <a href="http://forge.autodesk.com/">forge.autodesk.com</a>. </p>  <p>To apply for this program, you will need to submit a proposal of not more than 2000 words describing the project you'd like to work on and how it will make use of the Autodesk Forge APIs. More information on how to apply is available here. </p>  <p><a href="http://autodeskcloudaccelerator.com/apply/."><img title="Screen Shot 2016-04-29 at 1.44.24 PM" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="Screen Shot 2016-04-29 at 1.44.24 PM" src="/assets/image_2863.jpg" width="848" height="200" /></a></p>  <p>Instead of setting a deadline for proposals, we'll be accepting suitable projects as they come in, so don't wait too long!</p>  <p>This will be the 4th Cloud Accelerator in San Francisco and let me tell you, every single one has been an amazing experience, not only for the attendees to get to work shoulder to shoulder with Autodesk experts, but for us also has been a great experience to create new partners and definitely friends for life. </p>  <p>I'm looking forward to receiving your application.</p>  <p>We're deliberately holding this Accelerator the week after Forge DevCon, so you can come for the conference, spend the weekend at the hackathon (details to be announced soon), and then attend the Accelerator - all in one trip. Why not register for the <a href="http://forge.autodesk.com/conference/">Forge DevCon</a> today and enjoy the rainiest and foggiest Summer of your life <img class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-smile" style="border-top-style: none; border-bottom-style: none; border-right-style: none; border-left-style: none" alt="Smile" src="/assets/image_637884.jpg" />. </p>
