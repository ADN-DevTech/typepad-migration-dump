<p>By <a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/aec/katsuaki-takamizawa.html" target="_self">Katsuaki Takamizawa</a></p> <p>I got this inquiry and would like to share with you because I was also confused. Both NewFloor and NewSlab method creates a Floor element. The question was what is the difference?. The only difference is that NewSlab method can create a Floor with a slope.</p>
