<p>Happy new year from AEC workgroup, Developer Technical Services team.&#0160;I hope you all had a good rest over the holidays. (Personally, I certainly did.&#0160;After rather hectic traveling and lots of talking, I lost my voice toward the end of the trip and I needed to put myself in&#0160;the recovery mode.)&#0160;&#0160; </p>
<p>Last two months had been quite busy with Developer Days tours.&#0160;Traveling to the cities near equator and&#0160;in southern hemisphere&#0160;in November was&#0160;enjoyable in terms of weather. My second stretch to Korea and Japan in December,&#0160;on the other hand,&#0160;turned out to be another memorable experience with a&#0160;little different kind&#0160;of reasons;&#0160;it made me re-think of the power of mother nature.&#0160;On the day to fly from&#0160;Seoul&#0160;to Tokyo, snow started to fall. Our flight&#0160;was delayed by&#0160;five hours due to the snow.&#0160;I ended up being stuck&#0160;in&#0160;the airplane&#0160;for the whole time.&#0160;</p>
<p>While we were in Tokyo, another relatively big earth quake (magnitude 7.3, I hear) hit Touhoku area and we felt a big, long&#0160;shake while sitting in Autodesk Tokyo office.&#0160;The Tokyo office is in a high-rise building built on a man-made island off the Tokyo bay.&#0160; We were on the 24th floor. The duration felt like 10 min, although some said 5 min. I could hear the building making some noise.&#0160;It was quite scary even for me who used to live in Tokyo.&#0160; </p>
<p>What&#39;s interesting to me at that time is the role of internet and mobile devices&#0160;in the situation like this.&#0160;When the quake is coming, people gets notification to their mobile devices.&#0160;My colleagues around me all seems to get a message to their phone.&#0160;(I had a my phone roaming, but it did not help.)&#0160;One of my colleague was on bullet train when the quake hit.&#0160; He said he got the notification to his phone.&#0160; So he knew&#0160;what is going to happen next, he said. My sister, who is further away from epicenter, also sent me a text to make sure I was okay and not in a trouble or anything. There was a sequence of checking all the employees&#39; safety shortly after that, including&#0160;our director and myself who&#0160;were visitors on that day. &#0160; </p>
<p>I&#39;m now back in&#0160;Manchester,&#0160;admiring beautiful icicles and snows from the windows - gentle side of mother&#0160;nature. &#0160; </p>
<p>Wishing you peace and happiness in 2013. </p>
