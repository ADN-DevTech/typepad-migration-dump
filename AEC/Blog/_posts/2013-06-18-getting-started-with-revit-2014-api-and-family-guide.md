<p>Last year, I wrote about&#0160;my handy &quot;Getting Started with Revit API&quot; document (sometime I called it &quot;phase zero&quot;) as I get inquiries about Revit API&#0160;every so often.&#0160;Here it is the updated version:&#0160;&#0160;<span class="asset  asset-generic at-xid-6a0167607c2431970b0191037da892970c"><a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/files/getting-started-with-revit-2014-api.pdf">Download Getting Started with Revit 2014 API</a></span>. The changes are very minor: version number update and pointing to newer recordings. Old recordings&#0160;may be&#0160;still valuable for learning basics as the newer ones tend to focus on more advanced and specific topics.&#0160;So I&#39;m not going to repeat it here; rather&#0160;I&#0160;refer to the <a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/aec/2012/07/getting-started-with-revit-2013-api.html" target="_self" title="Getting Started with Revit API 2013">last year&#39;s page </a>for the majority of part. </p>
<p>Another inquiry I received recently is about&#0160;learning materials about Family creation. I double-checked the content manager here and he confirms that the&#0160;<a href="http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/item?siteID=123112&amp;id=13376394" target="_self" title="Family Guide">Family Guide posted here </a>is still the most complete one you can refer to&#0160;(although it was not updated for a few years.)&#0160; This page include guides translated in various languages, such as Chinese, German, French, and Japanese. If you are new to Revit, this will be a good starting point to learn Family creation.&#0160;If you are coming from Programing background, I must also emphasize that&#0160;to master Revit API, you will need to understand how Revit works in UI. </p>
<p>Good luck!</p>
