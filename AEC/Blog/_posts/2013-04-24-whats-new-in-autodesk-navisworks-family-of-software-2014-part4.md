<p>By <a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/aec/xiaodong-liang.html" target="_self">Xiaodong Liang</a></p>
<p>Continuing&#0160;from the&#0160;<a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/aec/2013/04/whats-new-in-autodesk-navisworks-family-of-software-2014-part3.html">last post</a>, we talk about the enhancements in the point cloud and clash detective in the Navisworks Simulate and Manage. </p>
<p><strong>Enhanced Point Cloud Engine and File Support</strong></p>
<p>An improved point cloud engine has been added to the Navisworks family supporting more formats (*.rcs /*.rcp) and enabling greater accessibility to large amounts of data. With this new engine, customers can import and visualize massive amounts of point information from laser scans and LiDAR hardware. </p>

<p>Now, it supports to measure, snap and clash these point clouds has also been added all to further support a reality capture workflow which can be extended into other Autodesk software like AutoCAD, Revit and Inventor. </p>
<p><strong>Clash Detective Enhancements</strong></p>
<p>A number of enhancements to the Clash Detective tool have improved the identification and management of clashes. Customers using Navisworks Manage can now set the highlight color of clashing items when viewing clashes and have the option of viewing clashes by clash status. Clash viewpoints can be automatically updated by using the Auto-Update Viewpoint setting, and an additional column with a camera icon indicates when a clash has an updated viewpoint. These viewpoints can also be manually updated by right-clicking on the camera icon, then clicking Save Viewpoint .</p>

<p>By popular demand, the single click to switch between Dim Other, Hide Other, and no isolation has been restored to the clash detection window. Other clash workflow enhancements to the interface include an additional column indicating the number of comments that have been made on a clash. Additional filter tools let you filter clashes based on your current object selections: </p>
<p>•None - will show all clashes </p>
<p>•Exclusive - will show clash results where both of the clashing items are included in your current item selection. </p>
<p>•Inclusive - will show clash results where one or both or the clashing items are included in your current item selection. </p>
<p>When generating reports, select the ‘Include only filtered results’ tick-box to include only clashes that are displayed in your currently filtered clash results list at the time you generate the report. </p>

<p>Last but not least, when multiple clashes are found between the same pair of composite objects, they will be treated as a single clash. Clashes between two parts of the same composite object will not be reported. This aids in reducing the amount of clashes in your model by reducing the repeating or redundant conflicts.</p>
