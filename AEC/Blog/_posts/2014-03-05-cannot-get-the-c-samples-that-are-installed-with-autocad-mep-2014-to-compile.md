<p>By <a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/aec/gopinath-.html">Gopinath Taget</a></p>  <p>Some of you may find that MEP .NET samples do not compile because the references to the AecArchMgd.dll and AecBaseMgd.dll assemblies could not be found.</p>  <p>You will find these assemblies (as well as other ACA specific assemblies) in the subfolder <strong>&lt;AutoCAD MEP Install Folder&gt;\ACA</strong>.</p>  <p>You will also find MEP specific assemblies in the subfolder <strong>&lt;AutoCAD MEP Install Folder&gt;\MEP</strong>.</p>
