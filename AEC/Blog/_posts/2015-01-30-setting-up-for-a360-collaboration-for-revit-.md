<p>I&#0160;recently went through the process of setting up the A360 Collaboration for Revit environment for our DevTech AEC team. I just made one blog post on <a href="http://the360view.typepad.com/" target="_self" title="The 360 view">The 360 view</a> based on my experience about it. I thought some of the audience here might find it interesting, too. (Also serves as a note to myself. I probably don&#39;t need to do this often, so I&#39;m sure I will forget ;-) &#0160;</p>
