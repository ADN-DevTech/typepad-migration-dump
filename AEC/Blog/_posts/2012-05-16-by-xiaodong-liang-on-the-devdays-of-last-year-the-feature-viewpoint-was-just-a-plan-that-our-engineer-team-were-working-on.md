<p>By <a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/aec/xiaodong-liang.html" target="_self">Xiaodong Liang</a></p>  <p>On the DevDays of last year, the feature viewpoint was just a plan that our engineer team were working on. With their effort, the feature is completed. I personally like the new feature very much. Not only many .NET developers are eager to having the ability, but also it allows us to manipulate the camera, which is widely used in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality">virtual reality</a>. </p>  <p>2013 .NET API provides the object ViewPoint. It corresponds to the anonymous viewpoint anytime how the eyes look at model. It has the properties to access/manipulate camera directly. You can move, rotate camera, set its align up vector, view direction etc. It has also other properties such as NearPlaneDistanc, FarPlaneDistance, LinearSpeed,AngularSpeed etc. It is not difficult to understand what they mean from the names. DocumentCurrentViewpoint is a new document part to access current viewpoint. </p>  <p>The first code we will see how to access the current viewpoint.</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>In the next post, we will introduce saved viewpoint.</p>  <p>(to be continued)</p>
