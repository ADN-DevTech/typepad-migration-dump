<p>Every once in a while, people contact us, asking the latest MgdDbgAec, a tool known as snoop tools.&#0160;Unfortunately, we haven&#39;t&#0160;had a chance to update it.&#0160; But it is still useful for learning and debugging AutoCAD Architecture. Here is&#0160;a minimum, flat migrated MgdDbgAec.&#0160;&#0160;We still keeps the obsolete methods&#0160;for the sake of debugging.&#0160; But at least it builds and load to ACA 2013.&#0160;We hope you find it useful.</p>
