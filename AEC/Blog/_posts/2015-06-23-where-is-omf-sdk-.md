<p><strong>Q.</strong> Where can find OMF SDK? &#0160;</p>
<p><strong>A. </strong>OMF SDK is posted on the ADN extranet http://adn.autodesk.com, the members only site. &#0160;</p>
<p>After logged into the ADN extranet, go to &quot;Software &amp; Support&quot; &gt;&gt; AutoCAD Architecture &gt;&gt; Download &gt;&gt; Object Modeling Framework (OMF). Follow the link and accept the license agreement. It will take you to the download page.</p>
<p><em>Note: OMF requires a separate license agreement and is provided to the member of ADN only.</em>&#0160;&#0160;</p>
