<p>By <a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/aec/jaime-rosales.html">Jaime Rosales</a></p>
<p>This upcoming weekend I will be attending my first Hackathon and I couldn’t be more excited about it. Here is a link from our evangelist Jeremy Tammik that explains more in detail about <a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2014/08/autodesk-exchange-apps-hackathon.html">Autodesk Exchange Apps Hackathon</a>.</p>
<p>Some of the topics to be discuss are:</p>
<p>How to architect your Autodesk App Exchange application for the following platforms:</p>
<ul>
<li>AutoCAD</li>
<li>Revit</li>
<li>Inventor</li>
<li>3ds Max</li>
<li>Maya</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Handling IPN notifications</li>
<li>Implementing simple copy protection for your app</li>
<li>Architecting your app to sell on monthly subscription</li>
<li>Selling online web services on Exchange Apps</li>
<li>Making use of Autodesk ‘cloud&#39; services such as our new, web-based, zero-client 3D model viewer</li>
<li>Sustainability apps</li>
</ul>
<p>Head on over to <a href="http://exchangeapphack.com/">exchangeapphack.com</a> for details on the event, a FAQ, the schedule and speaker line up, Rules and Registration link.</p>
<p>If you want to know more about it head over to this <a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2014/09/job-opportunities-events-plans-and-planes.html" target="_blank">link</a> to find out about Preparation, System requirements, Hardware and Interactive Q&amp;A of the Hackathon.</p>
<p>So as some of you already know, I have an amazing hobby that involves a Quad copter (Drone), a GoPro and a 3 year old excitement for new toys, and for some time I’ve been thinking about how making it more interesting with the awesome technologies that Autodesk have.</p>
<p>In my <a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/aec/2014/07/familytypes-value-aerial-pictures.html" target="_blank">first post</a> I showed you an aerial picture of the Autodesk Waltham office and this time using Recap 360 I created a 3D model of that office which I will show you here (<em>Keep in mind that this is my first time using Recap 360 and also now I will pay more attention on what kind of pictures I need to take in order to have a better looking model hehe</em>).</p>

<p>Nothing too fancy, but it is a little step to start doing some cool things with the use of these technologies and API’s. I heard from another ADN Evangelist about a group of enthusiastic guys who are starting to use Revit with their Drone. I will start investigating more about it and keep you guys posted.</p>
<p>Here is the <a href="http://revitmydrone.com/" target="_blank">link</a> about the group of guys called Revit my Drone who came together for the first time on the AEC Hackathon this past weekend in Seattle,WA.</p>
<p>Thank you for reading, until next time.</p>
