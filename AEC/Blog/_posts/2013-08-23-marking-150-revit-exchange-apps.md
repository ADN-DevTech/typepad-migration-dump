<p>By Mikako Harada</p>
<p>It wasn&#39;t long time ago that we celebrated marking the 100 <a href="http://apps.exchange.autodesk.com/RVT/en/Home/Index" target="_self" title="Revit App Store">Revit apps on the Exchange Store</a>. This week, we hit another -- 150 this time! &#0160;The Revit store is steadily gaining momentum, and becoming a &quot;meeting&quot; point for both customers and developers.&#0160;</p>
<p>We would like to use this opportunity to say thank you to the members of the DevTech store team, in particular to Roopa A.s, Nachikethan S, and Prashant S Potadar, who has been tirelessly working behind the scenes, packing and testing Revit apps. Great job and many thanks for assisting publishers.&#0160;</p>
