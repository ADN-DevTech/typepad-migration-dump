<p>The SDK of&#0160; Navisworks 2022 has been posted on&#0160; ADNOpen:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.autodesk.com/developer-network/platform-technologies/navisworks">https://www.autodesk.com/developer-network/platform-technologies/navisworks</a></p>
<p>The contents are mostly same to the previous releases, while <strong>ActiveX redistributabl</strong>e dll is deprecated. The following two are no longer included in the SDK:</p>
<ul>
<li>activex_redistributable_x64.msm</li>
<li>&#0160;Navisworks ActiveX Redistributable x64 Setup.exe</li>
</ul>
<p>These are based on an old technology. As an alternative solution, we encourage you to look at Forge Viewer. If you are new to Forge, here is a good getting started tutorial: <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/developer-network/platform-technologies/navisworks">https://learnforge.autodesk.io/</a> If you need help using Forge API, please contact <strong>forge.help@autodesk. com </strong>(*) . Forge team is happy to assist.</p>
<p>In a mean time, if you still requires redistributable dll while transitioning to an alternative solution, you may use 2021 version of dll. &#0160;2021 version of dll should continue function with 2022 version of Navisworks files. There is no change in the Navisworks file format between 2021 and 2022.&#0160;</p>
<p>Updated on July 14, 2021: updated the instruction to use 2021 redistributes.dll version. &#0160;</p>
