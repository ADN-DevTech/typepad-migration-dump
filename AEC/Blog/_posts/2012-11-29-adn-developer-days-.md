<p>By <a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/aec/mikako-harada.html" target="_self" title="Mikako Harada">Mikako Harada</a></p>
<p>This is <a href="http://au.autodesk.com/" target="_self" title="Autodesk University">AU (Autodesk University) </a>week.&#0160; A half of DevTech members are in Las Vegas right now, attending, teaching classes, and talking with customers.&#0160;One day before AU officially starts, we also host so-called Developer Day event to the members of ADN program, where we discuss what&#39;s coming in the new releases and encourage our partners to start migrating their applications so that when our new releases come out,&#0160;3rd party applications that our customers need are&#0160;also ready.&#0160;Because of those two events coming at the same time,&#0160;this time of the year is the busiest time for our team.&#0160;</p>
<p>Since this is a public blog, we cannot disclose everything right away.&#0160;But even if you are not ADN member, or you missed the conference, don&#39;t get disappointed; we plan to have a recorded version after new releases come out. So stay tuned for that.&#0160; </p>
<p>Personally, myself isn&#39;t attending the AU.&#0160;However, thanks to&#0160;a little&#0160;mobile app that Augusto wrote for his AU class and that we have being demo&#39;ing, I&#0160;could&#0160;have a little peek into the atmosphere&#0160;of this event right from my home.&#0160; Below is the a photo&#0160;from the morning session of Developer Day at AU in Las Vegas. (A big person with a white shirt in the front row is Fenton Webb.&#0160;He is always&#0160;very difficult to miss. So I can tell it is indeed our event.) &#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</p>

<p>For those who are interested in, what Augusto&#39;s a little mobile does is&#0160;as follows; he takes a photo using his mobile device. His app stores the photo in the cloud together with the location information.&#0160;I can then use AutoCAD Civil 3D to view a map like below&#0160;and&#0160;by clicking a mark on the map, I can see the picture like above.&#0160; </p>

<p>You can see where my teams are and where they have been.&#0160;We have been demo&#39;ing this app just to show how easy it is to write a little apps like this, using cloud and mobile technology. I will leave the detailed discussion to Augusto.&#0160;He has an AU class explaining how to do this. If you are interested in&#0160;taking a look, you can get a source code from his class. </p>
<p>Have&#0160;fun for the reminder of stay in&#0160;Vegas for the people who are attending AU, and have a safe trip home. </p>
