<p>The Autodesk Exchange Apps Hackathon event is over. We have received more than&#0160;<strong>180</strong>&#0160;Apps as part of this event.</p>
<p>On behalf of the Autodesk Developer Network (ADN) team I’d like to say a big “thank you” to all the publishers who has registered and submitted Apps to Autodesk exchange store.</p>
