<p>On Wednesday Autodesk announced the launch of <a href="http://usa.autodesk.com/revitlt/" target="_self" title="RevitLT">Autodesk Revit LT 2013</a>. As the name suggests, Revit LT is based on the Revit platform and is an intuitive 3D Building Information Modeling (BIM) application. Revit LT is a cost-effective entry point for architects, designers and building professionals to transition to BIM workflows. </p>
<p>We have already received inquiries about its API support. The answer is: no API with Revit LT.&#0160; If you are a developer who has a Revit application, there is no need to worry about testing your application against it.</p>
