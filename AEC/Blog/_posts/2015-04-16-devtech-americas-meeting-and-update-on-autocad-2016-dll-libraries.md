<p><a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/aec/jaime-rosales.html">By Jaime Rosales</a></p>  <p>Last week we had our annual DevTech Americas meeting in the San Francisco Autodesk office. 3 full days of activities with my teammates where we shared knowledge about the different roles and technologies, each one of us have expertise on and also experienced the culinary demand that San Francisco has to offer. Some examples will be Curry Up Now food truck and Roli Roti Gourmet Rostisserie, amazing food and the wait is worth it. </p>  <p><a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/.a/6a0167607c2431970b01b7c77a8424970b-pi"><img title="Roli Roti Gourment Rostisserie" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="Roli Roti Gourment Rostisserie" src="/assets/image_715695.jpg" width="240" height="235" /></a> <a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/.a/6a0167607c2431970b01bb081e7842970d-pi"><img title="Deconstroctude samosa" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="Deconstroctude samosa" src="/assets/image_948861.jpg" width="240" height="235" /></a> </p>  <p>We also had the chance to spend some time playing with Arduinos with our ADN Sr. Director&#160; Jim Quanci, who without much experience with the hardware got impressive results and even a couple of songs played by the mini speaker the Arduino kit brings. Me on the other side ended up with a burned finger when using the temperature sensor in the wrong way, I guess that happens when you have very big chubby fingers and use really small pieces. </p>  <p><a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/.a/6a0167607c2431970b01b7c77a842c970b-pi"><img title="Arduino Uno" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="Arduino Uno" src="/assets/image_441525.jpg" width="240" height="180" /></a> <a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/.a/6a0167607c2431970b01b8d10414cb970c-pi"><img title="DevTech America Arduino Workshop" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; margin-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; margin-right: 0px" border="0" alt="DevTech America Arduino Workshop" src="/assets/image_8144.jpg" width="240" height="180" /></a></p>  <p><strong>AutoCAD 2016 DLL Libraries Update.</strong></p>  <p>This week I got a developer asking about a missing DLL in the new version of AutoCAD 2016 Architecture. Check it out. </p>  <p><strong>Question</strong>:Where is the DLL &quot;AecUIBaseMgd.dll&quot; in AutoCAD Architecture 2016. I use the method Autodesk.Aec.ApplicationServices.Utility.CloningHelper. I can't find any hint to any changes to this dll.</p>  <p><strong>Response</strong>: <em>CloningHelper</em> now resides in &lt;install folder&gt;\ACA\AecCoreMgd.dll. Most of the legacy API from AecUIBaseMgd.dll has been moved to the new assembly in ACA 2016 release.</p>  <p>Thank you to Tony Zou from the ACRD AutoCAD team for sharing this important information with our developer community. </p>  <p>Thanks for reading until next time. </p>
