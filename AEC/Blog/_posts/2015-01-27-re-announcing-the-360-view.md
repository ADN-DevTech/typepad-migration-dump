<p>A little announce to make. I have been occasionally writing to Manu&#39;s &quot;<a href="http://the360view.typepad.com/" target="_self" title="The 360 view">The 360 View</a>&quot; blog. Over the weekend, Manu kindly put my photo to his blog &lt;blush&gt;, making me as an official co-author. I will be posting about BIM related topics from my point of view. So far, I have posted the materials for BIM 360 Glue API based on our AU presentation. Please visit <a href="http://the360view.typepad.com/" target="_self" title="The 360 view">there</a> occasionally and find out what we are up to.</p>
