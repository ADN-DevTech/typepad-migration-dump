<p>We are excited to announce the 2014&#0160;<a href="http://exchangeapphack.com/">Autodesk® Exchange Apps Hackathon</a>. While similar in concept to the Portathon that we held in 2013, this event is bigger, better, has new competitions and great prizes. Anyone can participate from anywhere in the world and at any time both before the event and during the Hackathon days. We’ve assembled a great line up of speakers to give presentations and demos on hot topics that will help your overall app development and technical experts will be on hand to help and guide you.</p>
<p>The Autodesk Exchange Apps Hackathon is a virtual web based Hackathon.&#0160; It’s a community event that gives you the opportunity to work closely with other members of the software development community and Autodesk engineers — in real time, developing new apps for Autodesk Exchange.&#0160;</p>
<p>The Hackathon will run from 9:00 a.m. U.S. Pacific Time (PT) on Saturday, September 20, 2014 to 4 p.m. PT on September 21, 2014. You can participate from anywhere you have internet access. &#0160;</p>
<p>The Hackathon is a free event.&#0160; Plus, there is a reward!&#0160; For all new apps submitted to the Autodesk Exchange Apps store by midnight on September 30, 2014 and accepted for publication in the store by November 30, 2014, you will receive US$ 100 per “non-Free” app and US $50 “Free or Trial” app for up to 5 apps per company.</p>
