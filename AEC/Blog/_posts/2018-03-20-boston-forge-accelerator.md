<p>The Forge team is accepting proposals for the upcoming Accelerator taking place in the Autodesk Boston office from April 30 - May 4, 2018.</p>
<p>It is a great opportunity for your software development team to learn and work intensively on a Forge-based project with one-on-one support and advice from Autodesk Forge API experts.&#0160; If you have an idea for a new web or mobile application based on Autodesk Forge APIs, or you need help getting an existing application working, then come along to the event. There is no cost to attend the Accelerator other than your own travel and living expenses. However, we do ask that you submit a proposal as part of your application so that we can verify that the intended use of the Autodesk Forge APIs in your project is feasible.</p>
<p>Apply and submit your proposal <a href="http://autodeskcloudaccelerator.com/apply/">here</a>. For more information, please visit the Forge Accelerator <a href="http://autodeskcloudaccelerator.com/forge-accelerator/">website</a>.</p>
