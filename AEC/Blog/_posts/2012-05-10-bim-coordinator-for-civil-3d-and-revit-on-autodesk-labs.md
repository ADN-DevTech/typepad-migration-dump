<p>Miroslav Schonauer, our colleague in Autodesk Consulting, informed me of&#0160;the availability of&#0160;a new application at <a href="http://labs.autodesk.com/utilities/bim_coordinator/" target="_self" title="BIM Coordinator">Autodesk Labs: BIM Coordinator for AutoCAD Civil 3D and Revit</a>.&#0160;You may be interested to have a look at this useful Autodesk Consulting utility for aligning the coordinate systems between AutoCAD/AutoCAD Civil 3D and Revit’s Shared Coordinates (also applicable to Revit’s Navisworks export). You can find the&#0160;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSxbv7QPero" target="_self" title="BIM Coordinator YouTube demo">demo on YouTube</a> as well.</p>
<p>For those of you who are attending the forthcoming AEC DevCamp in Waltham 6/7 June, Miro will be&#0160;presenting and explaining some more background and sharing some source code. For anyone coming in direct contact with customers, this will be an excellent&#0160;example of what Autodesk Consulting can do.&#0160; &#0160;</p>
<p>Currently, this is for 2012 versions. 2013 version will be available in coming weeks.</p>
