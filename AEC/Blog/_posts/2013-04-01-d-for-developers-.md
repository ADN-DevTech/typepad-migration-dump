<p>Happy Easter!&#0160; As you have seen by now, Autodesk has announced new 2014 product lines last week.&#0160; Together with, the new branding was also officially announced --- from bold and black to many pastel colors. As we celebrate Easter and arrival of spring, feels very appropriate. Changes to our web pages are still on going. The brand services team is very busy right now, making those changes.&#0160; </p>
<p>If you have watched the <a href="http://www.livestream.com/autodesk/video?clipId=pla_9d701de9-a386-4bc7-91ab-be3621c5b6e8&amp;utm_source=lslibrary&amp;utm_medium=ui-thumb" target="_blank" title="Global Launch Webcast Amar Hanspal">global launch webcast by Amar Hanspal last week</a>,&#0160;you heard this new brand image was inspired by Origami, or the Japanese art form of folding paper. It was also designed by internal people in the Autodesk using our own software; Autodesk makes many software that help people to imagine, design and create. Why can&#39;t we do it ourselves?&#0160; The result is – as you’ve all seen.&#0160; </p>
<p>I played a lot with Origami as a child. I still remember how to make a crane, basket, beach ball, morning glory, boat, organ, air plan and so on.&#0160; I sometimes&#0160;show to&#0160;children how to make them. It’s always fun to&#0160;watch how fascinated children are when they play with it---we then realize they are all play of your imagination. </p>
<p>It was during the DevDay tour when my director first told me about our needing a new image of Developer Network aligned with company&#39;s plan and asked me about it. At first I wasn’t sure if I wanted to do it, but it did not take too long before I was really into it; on the same day, I started to hold papers and make sketches wherever and whenever I got an idea in the coffee shop, on the kitchen counter, using report papers, even post-it, too! </p>
<p>Everything was going well and I was happy playing with Origami, until suddenly my manager came in and said: &quot;Mikako, nobody is writing a blog. Please make sure somebody is writing it.&quot;&#0160; That was literally a wakeup call. I had to think very hard which day it was today.&#0160; Happy April Fools Day! </p>
