<p>Since 2013 releases, Revit offers &quot;one box&quot; version which includes all three flavors of Revit (Architecture/Structure/MEP) as one product. However,&#0160;it is&#0160;available only as a part of Building&#0160;Design Suite Premium and Ultimate, and not as a standalone product.&#0160;You can find a trial version from the <a href="http://usa.autodesk.com/revit/trial/" target="_self" title="Autodesk Revit Products">Revit product page</a>. If you are&#0160;an ADN member, you can find it under <a href="http://adn.autodesk.com/adn/servlet/index?siteID=4814862&amp;id=16829938&amp;linkID=16829826" target="_self" title="Autodesk Building Design Suite Downloads">Autodesk Building Design Suite download page</a>&#0160;of the ADN extranet.</p>
