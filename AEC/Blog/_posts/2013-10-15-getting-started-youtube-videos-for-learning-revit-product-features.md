<p>Trying to answer a customer who asked for materials to learn product feature, I just bumped into the following links that brings to &quot;Getting Started&quot; YouTube videos to learn Revit product features. I thought I should share with you, too. &#0160;</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLY-ggSrSwbZogzHAEuvvzzTX0fiVGkxrc" target="_self" title="Revit Architecture Getting Started ">Revit for Architecture Getting Started</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLY-ggSrSwbZrIHb8SPjwQFHZOuEJzeykP" target="_self" title="Revit MEP Getting Started">Revit for MEP Getting Started</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLY-ggSrSwbZrZxrcrompAi9mCqqOTpW0A" target="_self" title="Revit Structure Getting Started">Revit for Structure Getting Started</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Just clicking the first one, and viewing the first video, I already learned what I did not know; you can right click on ViewCube and there are more menus in there! Choosing &quot;Orient to View&quot; allows you align the view direction to the same direction as other views in the project. Enjoy!</p>
