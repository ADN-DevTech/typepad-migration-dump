<p>During the past months Autodesk has been working in collaboration with the big Social Media app, Snapchat in order to develop a new on-site application that will help many customers in their daily job. We called it SnapBIM, and we are very excited to share some of the first Snaps the app can do with you today.</p>

<p>SnapBIM will make the collaboration in the field using the social media platform so much easier. Will allow you to make text and drawing Markups on the spot, adding all those Snaps to a designated Cloud Folder where will automatically sync and create a daily report, to be reviewed by your BIM Manager with a single sign on using your Autodesk ID.</p>

<p>SnapBIM will simplify creating and updating markups; reference Snaps in your personal cloud folder by creating a daily report with the issues found anywhere on the job site —online or offline.</p>

<p>This will become available in the fall and currently we are in Beta, requesting your help in order to try the app. It is a free download (for now) and only 500 lucky Beta testers will get the chance to make their daily workflow a little bit more stress-free and productive when being on the job-site.</p>
