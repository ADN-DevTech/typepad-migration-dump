<p>I&#39;m pleased to announce that Manu Venugopal, Integration Expert in Autodesk Consulting and our API liaison to the BIM 360 Glue product team, has recently started a blog called &quot;<strong><a href="http://the360view.typepad.com/blog/" target="_self" title="The 360 View ">The 360 View</a></strong>&quot;. He was warming up a bit, trying to familiarize himself with the system. He tells me that he is ready to let others know now.&#0160;The goal of the blog is to provide technical resources about BIM 360 products families including Glue and Field, including APIs.</p>
<p>Manu and I have been working very closely for the last 18 months or so through BIM 360 Glue API. He has been the behind the scenes &quot;brain&quot; for the ADN support for BIM 360 Glue API. He has helped a lot when preparing for the last two Developer Days presentations about BIM 360. &#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>As <a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/aec/2013/10/bim-360-glue-api-pilot-and-updated-samples.html" target="_self" title="Glue pilot status">mentioned previously</a>, Glue API is still in the pilot stage. The number of people who can actually use API is still very much limited. We are actively discussion the way to expand it. I hope you can still find it as a good source to learn and keep eyes on the progress of BIM 360. &#0160; &#0160;</p>
