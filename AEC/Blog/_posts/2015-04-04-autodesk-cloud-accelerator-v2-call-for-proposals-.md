<p>Autodesk Developer Network has hosted so called &quot;Autodesk Cloud Accelerator&quot; program between March 9th and 20th, where invited cloud developers of Autodesk cloud technologies gathered at Autodesk&#39;s San Francisco office and spent two weeks developing the proposed applications, while mingling with various decision makers from Autodesk. Jaime Rosales represented AEC workgroup and spent time there. Sounds like it was a big success. (I hear that Hazel Wood of ADN marketing are preparing a video to show the activities. So stay tuned for that to get the idea about the program.)</p>
