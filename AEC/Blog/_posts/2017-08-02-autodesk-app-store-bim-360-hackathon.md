<p>We are excited to announce the Autodesk® App Store BIM 360 Hackathon – a virtual web based event.&#0160; This hackathon is a great way to quickly climb the BIM 360+Forge API integration learning curve with Autodesk engineers close at hand (virtually).</p>
<p>Now is a great time to get started working on integration with BIM 360 – with the new ability to create your own folders in BIM 360 using Forge just enabled in the last week.&#0160; You can now quickly and easily build a “presence” for your company and apps data within BIM 360.&#0160; During the hackathon introduction webinar on August 15th, we’ll be talking about what you can do right now to integrate with BIM 360.</p>
<p><br /> The Autodesk® App Store BIM 360 Hackathon consists of two segments:</p>
<ol>
<li>A series of web training sessions related to the Autodesk Forge platform and BIM 360 - open to anyone interested in learning about these APIs.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li>An online hackathon where developers can develop new apps that integrate with BIM 360 for submission to Autodesk App Store.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is an online hackathon so you can participate from anywhere in the world on your own schedule.&#0160; There’s no cost to participate—but there is a reward!&#0160; You may find yourself quickly building an app that works with BIM 360—and if you submit it to the App Store by September 30 and it is accepted for publication by October 31 you will receive $500 for one eligible app per entrant.&#0160; Another reason to work on BIM 360 integration sooner rather than later is that we’ll be launching a BIM 360 app “Showcase” on&#0160;<a href="http://www.autodesk.com">www.autodesk.com</a> plus a BIM 360 app storefront in the Autodesk App Store in the next few weeks.&#0160; Both offer a great way to get maximum exposure for your business with Autodesk BIM 360 customers (when there are just a few dozen apps so you don’t risk getting lost in the crowd later when there are hundreds of apps).</p>
<p>You may attend the educational webinars without publishing an app. Click&#0160;<a href="https://bim360hackathon.devpost.com/details/webinars">here&#0160;</a>for Webinar only registration&#0160;or get full details and register for the Hackathon at&#0160;<a href="https://bim360hackathon.devpost.com/">https://bim360hackathon.devpost.com/</a>.
