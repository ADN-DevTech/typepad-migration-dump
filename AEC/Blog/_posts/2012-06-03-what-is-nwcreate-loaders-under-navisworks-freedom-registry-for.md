<p>By <a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/aec/xiaodong-liang.html" target="_self">Xiaodong Liang</a></p>  <p><b>Issue</b></p>  <p>As I am aware, Freedom has no support of COM API. But there is a registry [<b>NWCreate Loaders</b>] under Freedom. What is it for? Even though I put the similar setting as Manage within it, Freedom does not know my loader. </p>  <p><a name="section2"></a></p>  <p><b>Solution</b></p>  <p>Freedom can only open NWD and NWF files. It is a bit confusing to have this registry [ NWCreate Loaders ] under Freedom. We have log this problem to remove it in the future release of Freedom. </p>
