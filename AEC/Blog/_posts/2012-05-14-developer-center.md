<p>By <a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/aec/saikat-bhattacharya.html" target="_self">Saikat Bhattacharya</a></p>  <p>This is a quick announcement post – we have recently updated the layout, structure and the content for each of the AEC product’s Developer Center pages (this is a part of a larger overhaul/redesign project for the Developer Center’s online content for all our products- which is nearing its completion). The AEC product’s Developer Center pages can be accessed via each of the following links -</p>  <p><a href="http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/index?siteID=123112&amp;id=3377116">Autodesk Architecture</a></p>  <p><a href="http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/index?siteID=123112&amp;id=15024694">Autodesk Navisworks</a></p>  <p><a href="http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/index?siteID=123112&amp;id=2484975">Autodesk Revit</a> </p>  <p>These pages contain all the resources (and further links) that might be helpful in your customization and application development efforts with each of our Product APIs. </p>  <p>We hope you find the Developer Center pages very useful!</p>
