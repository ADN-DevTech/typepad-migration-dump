<p>Having an&#0160;additional role as a DevTech geo manager, I get all sort of inquiries. (literally all kinds ...) Licensing questions is one of them.&#0160;Maybe not be so excising as a programing topic; yet, still important to know from legal perspective for both partners and Autodesk. So here it is&#0160;one question about the licensing. </p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> </p>
<p>We have developed a plug-in for an Autodesk product. I want to bring in clients for training on this plug-in.&#0160; What kind of license do we need for this?&#0160; </p>
<p>Let’s say, we would have 10-12 people coming to&#0160;learn about our analysis application integrated with Revit. What type of licensing would be required for the training PCs like this?&#0160; I’m an ADN member.&#0160; I intend to charge for such a training. But the training is solely about our plug-ins. </p>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong></p>
<p>If you are providing trainings for free of charge and you are the member of ADN, you can use the ADN copies of software.&#0160; Please contact local ADN marketing for additional licenses.&#0160;&#0160; </p>
<p>For others, i.e., you intend to charge fees for the training, or you are not the ADN member, you will need to be the member of Autodesk Training Centers (ATC).&#0160; Please contact your local ATC representatives about how to become ATC member. You can find the information about ATC program at the following site: &#0160;<br /><a href="http://www.autodesk.com/atc">http://www.autodesk.com/atc</a>,&#0160;</p>
