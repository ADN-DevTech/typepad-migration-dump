<p>Some of you may heard, DevTech EMEA (European) team is heading to Prague shortly to host the third <a href="http://autodeskcloudaccelerator.com/" target="_self" title="http://autodeskcloudaccelerator.com/">Cloud Accelerator</a>&#0160;program. Prior to the event, they are holding a meetup there:</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.meetup.com/I-Love-DWG-Prague/events/225070857/">“I Love DWG” MeetUp</a> in Prague on Tuesday evening September 8th</strong></p>
<p>For this gathering, <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/" target="_self" title="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/">Kean Walmsley</a> (famous AutoCAD blogger, AutoCAD software engineer) and <a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/autocad/adam-nagy.html" target="_self" title="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/autocad/adam-nagy.html">Adam Nagy</a> (DevTech Manufacturing Technical Lead who know almost every API’s we support) will be there to meet you and show you the latest about AutoCAD I/O and View and Data API. Kean created very interesting sites, <a href="http://jigsawify.com" target="_BLANK">http://jigsawify.com</a>&#0160;using AutoCAD I/O &#0160;and <a href="http://vrok.it" target="_BLANK">http://vrok.it</a>&#0160;with View &amp; Data API. If you want to find out how he did it, and to take advantage of meeting him in person, it will be a great opportunity. &#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>I know for most of us it’s a long shot for being there just for one evening. But if you are in Europe, looking for a last summer escape, you may consider heading that direction. They say they will take you for dinner :-)</p>
<p>Prague is one of the places I want to visit one day. I was hoping that they will ask me to come to support BIM 360 API. But looking like it is all covered for now. Maybe some other time ...</p>
