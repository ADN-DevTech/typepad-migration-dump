<p>Announcing yet another blog by DevTech team, &quot;<a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/technology_perspective/" target="_self" title="Technology Perspective Japan">Technology Perspective from Japan</a>.&quot; This is by DevTech team in Japan + myself.&#0160;As this will be written in Japanese, many of you are most likely not able to read it.&#0160; Still, with the assumption that some of the audience out there understand Japanese like myself, I&#39;m putting a note here.&#0160;I will be writing mostly about Revit API and other AEC related products API&#39;s. Toshiaki will be focusing on&#0160;platform including could and mobile. Shigekaze,&#0160;manufacturing. &#0160;</p>
