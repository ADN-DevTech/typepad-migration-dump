<p>ADN Developer Days are not an event just for the U.S. members. We hold the same event across the world in various countries. Two weeks ago, I was in Singapore to present AEC sessions.&#0160;Again, technical detail to follow at more appropriate time. For now, I just wanted to share a few photos I have taken during the trip: the photos of&#0160;so-called &quot;supertree.&quot; </p>
<p>In case you haven&#39;t heard, the supertrees and surrounding area is one of&#0160;Singapore&#39;s latest attraction. It is a part of the park&#0160;called <a href="http://www.gardensbythebay.com.sg/en/the-gardens/attractions/supertree-grove.html" target="_self" title="Gardens by the bay">Gardens by the Bay</a>. The idea of this supertree&#0160;is to create a man-made mechanical forest in vertical direction, self-contained using solar power; although I heard it is not 100% self-contained, yet.&#0160;But certainly it&#39;s attracting lots of&#0160;tourist around the world, contributing for the economy.&#0160;You can find more pictures and read an&#0160;article about it <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2012/06/08/world/asia/singapore-supertrees-gardens-bay/index.html" target="_self" title="supoertree on cnn ">here</a>.&#0160;Their <a href="http://www.gardensbythebay.com.sg/en/the-gardens/attractions/supertree-grove.html" target="_self" title="Gardens by the Bay">official site</a>&#0160;includes a page describing&#0160;about&#0160;their <a href="https://www.gardensbythebay.com.sg/en/the-gardens/about-the-gardens.html#!/sustainability-efforts" target="_self" title="sustanability effort ">sustanability effort</a>.&#0160;If you are curious who designed this, here is&#0160;one <a href="http://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/news/daily-news/first-look-at-wilkinson-eyre-and-grants-singapore-supertrees/8632024.article" target="_self" title="architects of supertree">link</a>&#0160;to find out.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>During the Asia Pacific DevDays, we cover three countries in one week.&#0160;The&#0160;DevDays trip is like running around in full speed among airports and conference venues one after another. Our conference ends 5:00pm~.&#0160;Our flight next day&#0160;leaves 7:15am.&#0160; I almost thought I would not have a chance to see this.&#0160;But I found that it is open till 2am!&#0160; I managed to convince&#0160;our director to go and see this.&#0160; </p>
<p>In the picture below, the funnel like structures with colorful lights are supertrees. The dinosaur&#0160;like structure behind are conservatories.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/.a/6a0167607c2431970b017ee5c9dd90970d-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="SuperTree1" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0167607c2431970b017ee5c9dd90970d image-full" src="/assets/image_280661.jpg" title="SuperTree1" /></a></p>
<p>Below, you can see the light changes.&#0160; My original plan was to come closer and take a look at the details of those structure. Unfortunately, due to the bad weather we had on that day, we couldn&#39;t get&#0160;up to the observation deck for the tour.&#0160;And it was too dark to see the detail from outside.&#0160; But we did go on top of the biggest supertree.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/.a/6a0167607c2431970b017c3426364f970b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="SuperTree2" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0167607c2431970b017c3426364f970b image-full" src="/assets/image_55946.jpg" title="SuperTree2" /></a></p>
<p>Here is a photo of the hotel next to the garden, looking&#0160;like a spaceship, taken from the top of the supertree. </p>

<p>Hopefully&#0160;I will have another chance to visit there. And if I do, I will try to go there during the day time.&#0160;Many thanks to our director, who accompanied me to visit there in spite of the super busy schedule.&#0160; </p>
