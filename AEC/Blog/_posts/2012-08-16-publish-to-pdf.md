<p><strong>Issue</strong></p>
<p>I want to publish Revit files as PDFs.&#0160;How can I do it using Revit API? &#0160;</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
<p>There are many software that you can install on your machine and create PDF.&#0160; (Some are free. Please search on the web.) Once you have it installed, you can use print API and set the PDF writer software as a name of the printer. Please take a look at ViewPrinter SDK sample for&#0160;the usage of the print API.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
