<p>By <a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/aec/katsuaki-takamizawa.html" target="_self">Katsuaki Takamizawa</a></p>  <p>I delivered Revit 2013 API webcast in Japanese in July 26<sup>th</sup> last week mainly for Japanese speaking audience. We had 20 attendees. Thank you very much for those who attended the webcast. </p>  <p>The webcast covered the introduction of new 2013 API and new SDK samples. I demonstrated some interesting new SDK samples including idling/external event for asynchronous access to Revit API and UI integration API features.</p>  <p>The recording and the slides (.PDF) are available at <a href="http://www.autodesk.co.jp/adsk/servlet/item?siteID=1169823&amp;id=10281985">Japanese Developer Center webpage</a> and <a href="http://adn.autodesk.com/adn/servlet/index?siteID=4814862&amp;id=5475217&amp;linkID=4901650">ADN extranet (for ADN members)</a> for download.</p>
