<p>By <a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/aec/katsuaki-takamizawa.html" target="_self">Katsuaki Takamizawa</a></p> <p>The contextual tab will be displayed with the selection. For example, [Modify| Walls] tab is displayed when a wall is selected with a cursor. However, you might not want this happen in some cases.&#160; For instance, you want to keep your plug-in’s ribbon tab displayed when an element is selected. </p>  <p>Unfortunately, you can not achieve this using API. But you can go to R&gt;Options dialog&gt;”User Interface” tab and unclick the “Display the contextual tab on selection”. Then, The tab stays with the selection.</p>
