<p>By <a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/aec/xiaodong-liang.html" target="_self">Xiaodong Liang</a></p>  <p><b>Issue</b></p>  <p>I'm using Navisworks ActiveX. With some methods, I get &quot;Navisworks Error - API Unlicensed&quot;. Could you explain which version of ActiveX controls work in what context?&#160; </p>  <p><a name="section2"></a></p>  <p><b>Solution</b></p>  <p>The functionalities of Lite/Full control (before Navisworks 2012) or Redistributable control (since Navisworks 2012) are limited. Basically all you can do is open a model, change navigation mode and select pre-defined viewpoints. Please refer to the <a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/aec/2012/05/navisworks-activex-controls.html">post</a> for more details. </p>  <p>Please note: currently, we do <font color="#ff0000">NOT</font> have any policy to enable the&#160; Lite/Full/Redistributable control with full API abilities.</p>
