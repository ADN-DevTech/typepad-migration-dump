<p>One of the things that ADN team does together with&#0160;various product teams is API wishlist survey.&#0160;This year&#39;s wishlist survey is now open for Revit and Navisworks from the following links:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.zoomerang.com/Survey/WEB22FR9A8WHJ9" target="_self" title="Revit API wishlist survey">Revit</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.zoomerang.com/Survey/WEB22FRMLV62H3" target="_self" title="Navisworks wishlist survey">Navisworks</a></p>
<p>Please take a moment to complete these surveys and give us a feedback.&#0160; It will take less than&#0160;5 minutes to complete each survey.&#0160;Our engineering teams use this feedback to help prioritize the areas of API enhancements in coming releases. If you leave your e-mail address, we will send you the final results after it is concluded.&#0160;</p>
<p>The deadline for the&#0160;survey for Revit and Navisworks API is <strong>June 1st, 2012</strong>.&#0160;We look forward to&#0160;receiving your feedback!</p>
<p>The wishlist surveys for other products will follow shortly.</p>
