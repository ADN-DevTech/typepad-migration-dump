<p>First, we are very sorry about problems we are experiencing with online help site.&#0160;</p>
<p>I just heard from the User Experience team that the following link as been restored:&#0160;</p>
<p><a href="http://wikihelp.autodesk.com/Revit/enu/2014/Help/3661-Developers" target="_self" title="WikiHelp Revit 2014 API Guide">http://wikihelp.autodesk.com/Revit/enu/2014/Help/3661-Developers</a></p>
<p>This is a temporary remedy till the migration to new help.autodesk is completed. I just tested the above link, and I see that it does not redirect to the new site. &#0160;One thing I noticed is that if we try to search, it redirects to the new site, which is inconvenient. I already asked if they can stop that, too. &#0160;We will see...</p>
<p>We sincerely appreciate your understanding and patience. &#0160;</p>
