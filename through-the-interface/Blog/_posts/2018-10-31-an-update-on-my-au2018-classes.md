<p>There’s just over a week to go before the craziest week of my year (i.e. <a href="http://au.autodesk.com" target="_blank">Autodesk University</a>) kicks off, once again. I’ve been heads-down preparing various slide-decks and handouts for the big event. Things are in reasonably good shape, but there’s still a bit of work left to do.</p><p>I had a quick glance at the class list – mainly to make sure that I had the classes themselves in my calendar, before people start double-booking me for meetings – and I noticed the numbers of registrations:</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad3bca76d200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="504" height="357" title="My AU2018 classes" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="My AU2018 classes" src="/assets/image_874056.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Here’s a list to the various classes with links so you can check out the descriptions:</p><p><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2">

<p></tbody></table><p>The ones that have been posted for a while have decent enough attendance: the third in the list is already full, it seems. The second of my classes is perhaps a little undersubscribed – which is completely normal, given the fact it was added very late in the day – but that particular class is going to be super-cool: it’ll contain information about all the things we’ve been doing with the Forge viewer in <a href="http://dasher360.com" target="_blank">Dasher 360</a> around realtime and historical sensor data. I gave this class at the Forge DevCon in Darmstadt, but that was the week before we were able to display realtime skeleton data for the MX3D bridge and animate a robot based on data we’d collected in a lab. So much cool stuff!<a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad376e1e9200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="222" title="Robots, skeletons and streamlines" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Robots, skeletons and streamlines" src="/assets/image_776679.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Anyway – if it looks like you’re going to be at either the Forge DevCon or Connect &amp; Construct, please do <a href="https://autodeskuniversity.smarteventscloud.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=254393" target="_blank">sign up for this class</a>. You won’t be disappointed!</p></p>
