<p>During the general wind-down before Autodesk’s annual “week of rest”, I’ve been spending some time this week getting more of my AutoCAD-Kinect integration samples working with the pre-release Kinect for Windows 2.0 device and SDK. Things are actually working pretty well: all samples – barring those that rely on capabilities that aren’t yet part of the SDK – are functional and some have even been enhanced based on new capabilities of the 2.0 device.</p>  <p>For instance, I’ve reworked the “piping” sample (the one that extrudes a circular profile through 3D space) to make use of the distance between the palm and the thumb to define a finer-grained profile than was possible using the distance between two hands.</p>  <p>Here’s an example of some text I was able to draw in 3D using the updated sample, along with the associated point cloud.</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201a3fabe3bf2970b-pi"><img style="display: inline" title="Merry Xmas" alt="Merry Xmas" src="/assets/image_743012.jpg" width="470" height="366" /></a></p>  <p>I’d like to wish all the very best for the festive season – whether you’re celebrating or not – and for 2014. May this coming year bring you everything you wish for, personally, professionally and technologically. :-)</p>
