<p>The awesome Jacqueline Rohrmann – who you may know as <a href="https://twitter.com/ThatBIMGirl" target="_blank">That BIM Girl</a> – has recorded a great “virtual unboxing” video introducing a couple of useful Dynamo packages, <a href="https://dynamobim.org/dynamaps/" target="_blank">DynaMaps</a> (which has it origins from the <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2019/04/the-first-dynamo-hackathon.html" target="_blank">Dynamo and Generative Design Hackathon held in London in April</a>) and <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2019/03/the-space-analysis-package-for-dynamo-and-refinery-is-now-available.html" target="_blank">Space Analysis</a>.</p><br><p align="center"><iframe width="500" height="283" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7Yq9hAgFKmo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"></iframe></p><br><p>Jacqueline shared <a href="https://youtu.be/7Yq9hAgFKmo" target="_blank">the video</a> with me earlier this week – when we were both at <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2019/06/au-london-2019.html" target="_blank">the Dynamo Day in London, and then AU London 2019</a> – but I hadn’t found the time to watch it until now. She’s done – as ever – an amazing job at presenting things in an entertaining and accessible style, stepping through the example shared in <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2019/04/using-the-space-analysis-package-for-pathfinding-and-visibility-in-dynamo.html" target="_blank">this post</a>. Check it out!</p><p>On a side note, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6536306862432768000" target="_blank">I know from LinkedIn</a> that Jacqueline has now wrapped up her studies and is thinking about what’s next. In her own words, Jacqueline is “looking for innovative, digital (or wanting to digitalise) companies - preferably with an environmental or social agenda.” I know she’s considering moving abroad, so geographical location doesn’t appear to be a constraint. If you’re interested in hiring someone with boundless energy and enthusiasm, as well as a strong technical background and a mastery of social media, you should definitely <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacqueline-rohrmann-b17130141/" target="_blank">contact Jacqueline through LinkedIn</a>. (Jacqueline doesn’t know I’m making this request on her behalf… I just feel it’s a great opportunity for some lucky company to snap her up.)</p><p>And finally, something I revealed about the Space Analysis package during our AU London class was the fact that Rhys Goldstein has found a way to implement acoustics analysis using the same core data structures we’re currently using for both visibility and pathfinding (i.e. what’s shown in the above video).</p><p>Here are a couple of GIFs that show this new (or future) capability, firstly with a basic scene:</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a46870a1200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="327" title="Simple acoustics" style="margin: 30px auto; float: none; display: block;" alt="Simple acoustics" src="/assets/image_677304.jpg"></a></p><p>And this one with the MaRS office floorplan:</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a46870a8200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="327" title="Office acoustics" style="margin: 30px auto; float: none; display: block;" alt="Office acoustics" src="/assets/image_100701.jpg"></a></p><p>This is really exciting! I’ll post an update once acoustics have been added to the publicly posted package (and maybe even to <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2019/06/project-rediscover-is-now-available-for-download.html" target="_blank">Project Rediscover</a> – we’ll see).</p>
