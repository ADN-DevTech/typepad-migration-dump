<p>I woke up this morning thinking “it’s about that time of year”. Sure enough, it was eight years ago today that I made <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2006/06/welcome.html" target="_blank">the first post to this blog</a>.</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201a3fd214913970b-pi" target="_blank"><img title="Lego cake" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 20px auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="Lego cake" src="/assets/image_587677.jpg" width="410" height="279" /></a></p>  <p>[This reminds me that the blog really could use a face-lift, if only for my photograph: I keep meaning to get a new profile snap taken, as I now have significantly more facial hair… nothing too crazy, just a small part of my ongoing southerly follicular migration ;-). And as I’m bound to look older – especially as I’ll forgo the Photoshopping my photographer friend insisted on, last time around – should it really be called a face-lift? Perhaps my blog actually needs a face-drop?]</p>  <p>Many thanks to all of you for your readership. Please don’t forget to continue to post comments, whether via the blog itself or via other social media. It’s your feedback and continued interest that keep the whole thing moving along…</p>  <p><font color="#666666">photo credit: </font><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/carbonnyc/9694730998/"><font color="#666666">CarbonNYC</font></a><font color="#666666"> via </font><a href="http://photopin.com"><font color="#666666">photopin</font></a><font color="#666666"> </font><a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/"><font color="#666666">cc</font></a></p>
