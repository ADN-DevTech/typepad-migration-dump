<p>I think I’ve mentioned in the past that in Switzerland the annual winter half-term break – the <em>Winterferien</em> or <em>semaine blanche</em> – is basically meant for skiing or snowboarding. Or sledging, I suppose.</p><p>The canton of Neuchatel has its Republic Day on March 1st, so the holiday week always falls to include this day (other cantons have theirs sometime earlier in February). Frankly, with the shifting seasons, this is starting to feel a little late – snow is far from guaranteed, these days, at this time of year, and this winter season turned out to be exceptionally dry in the Alps.</p><p>We felt really lucky that the weekend before our holidays started we received&nbsp; a smallish dump of snow. It always makes a difference to see snow in the trees.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202b7519998b7200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Lots of snow-filled trees" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Lots of snow-filled trees" src="/assets/image_789345.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202b751754d5b200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="375" height="500" title="A snow-filled tree" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="A snow-filled tree" src="/assets/image_41130.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Soon afterwards the sun came out, and stayed with us all week. Some mornings I went up early, on my own, so I could get some work done in the afternoons.<p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202b7519998bf200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="A quick selfie" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="A quick selfie" src="/assets/image_20338.jpg" border="0"></a></p></p><p>Other days I went up with our younger two kids, who have both now far surpassed my own ability on a snowboard.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202b6852c783e200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="281" height="375" title="Anokhi on her board" align="left" style="margin: 30px 20px 30px 50px; border-image: none; float: left; display: inline; background-image: none;" alt="Anokhi on her board" src="/assets/image_810566.jpg" border="0"></a><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202b75175442f200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="281" height="375" title="Zeph on his board" align="right" style="margin: 30px 50px 30px 0px; border-image: none; float: right; display: inline; background-image: none;" alt="Zeph on his board" src="/assets/image_279585.jpg" border="0"><br></a></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Our eldest didn’t have last week off – his second semester at EPFL has kicked in with a vengeance – but he did come up with us for the weekend, at least.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202b751754433200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Kalan on his board" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Kalan on his board" src="/assets/image_805660.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrouille_Suisse" target="_blank">Patrouille Suisse</a> were practicing quite a bit, during the week.
