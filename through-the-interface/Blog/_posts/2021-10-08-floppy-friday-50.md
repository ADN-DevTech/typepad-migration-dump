<p>We made it to 50 episodes! I’ll only record another 14 – to take it up to a round 64 – so we’re getting close now.</p>
<p>I wanted to make it a special one, but as I was a little busy getting ready to leave on holiday I didn’t quite get the time to research each game ahead of time. I do think <a href="https://youtu.be/u7v1MmQ7byU" rel="noopener" target="_blank">this episode</a> has a nice selection, nonetheless.</p>
<p>We started by playing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradius_(video_game)" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Nemesis</a>, which was released in some places as Gradius, apparently, and then played <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flimbo%27s_Quest" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Flimbo’s Quest</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destroyer_(video_game)" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Destroyer</a>. All gdecent games. I also tried (and failed) to load <a href="https://csdb.dk/release/?id=169036" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Asterix in Morgenland</a>, but so it goes.</p>
