<p>Tomorrow we’re heading on an extended* family trip to Cuba. My thanks to President Obama for timing his trip to finish just before ours (<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/20/barack-obama-cuba-visit-us-politics-shift-public-opinion-diplomacy" target="_blank">apparently it was all a bit hectic</a>).</p>
<p><em>* It’s an extended (2 week) trip with my extended (on my wife’s side) family, so I suppose it’s an extended<sup>2</sup> family trip.</em></p>

<p>I’ve always wanted to visit Cuba, so I’m really happy to be making this trip. We’ll be spending 10 days on <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Tourism-g737152-Cayo_Largo_Cuba-Vacations.html" target="_blank">Cayo Largo</a> – mostly diving and snorkelling – with a couple of days in Havana on either side to soak up the culture. I suspect it’s the days in Havana that I’ll enjoy the most, but then it’ll probably do me good to kick back on a beach for a few days.</p>
<p>I don’t expect to have internet access while I’m there, so this blog is likely to go a quiet, aside from a few blog posts I’ve managed to queue up over the last few days. I’ll do my best to post the occasional <a href="http://twitter.com/keanw" target="_blank">tweet</a>, assuming I manage to find a wifi hotspot from time to time.</p>
<p>¡Hasta luego!</p>
