<p>As people who have seen <a href="https://keanw.com/retro-computing" target="_blank">my regular Friday posts over the last 6 months</a> will realise, I have a deep fondness for historical technology. It’s not limited to video games or event electronics: I have a decent collection of antique View-Masters, as for me the stereoscope was an early ancestor of modern VR. I do have a few <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2018/04/one-mans-treasure-unboxing-autocad-26.html" target="_blank">old copies of Autodesk software</a>, but it’s not something I collect actively – I tend to leave that to <a href="https://autodesk.blogs.com/between_the_lines/autocad_history/" target="_blank">Mr. Hurley</a>.</p><p>When Alessandro Miele <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6797403189881700352/" target="_blank">tagged me in a LinkedIn post</a> a week or so ago, I didn’t expect to find myself watching 2 hours of video footage from 1985. I was utterly captivated by this video of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RUCAPS" target="_blank">RUCAPS, the Really Universal Computer Aided Production System</a> (the RU originally stood for Riyadh University, apparently). Bear in mind that this was the former generation of CAD-centric technology – in the sense it needed a minicomputer to run, not even a high-end workstation – but the main thing I found impressive was the extent to which concepts implemented in this system are relevant today. Amazing stuff.</p><p style="text-align: center"><br /></p><p style="text-align: center"><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="333" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z8DVySK2ZWg" title="YouTube video player" width="500"></iframe></p><p><br /></p><p>Now I’m far from being an expert on modern BIM technology (I needed a Zoom call with a colleague, last week, for him to show me how to split some rooms inside Revit, as I almost never use the tool) and frankly am almost completely unaware of the history of the products developed in this space. Please feel free to educate me by posting comments on this post – or on social media – about things of which I’m unaware.</p><p>So I found it very interesting to find this quote mentioned on the RUCAPS wikipedia page, that Jerry Laiserin shared via <a href="http://laiserin.com/features/issue17/feature02.php" target="_blank">this site</a> :</p><blockquote><p><i>While Autodesk Revit may not contain genomic snippets of Reflex code, Revit clearly is spiritual heir to a lineage of BIM &quot;begats&quot; – RUCAPS begat Sonata, Sonata begat Reflex, and Reflex begat Revit.</i></p></blockquote><p>Thanks to Alessandro also tagging <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Ingram" target="_blank">Jonathan Ingram</a> on his post, we ended up connecting and having a quick online chat about the history of BIM. Jonathan recently wrote a book on the topic, entitled <a href="https://www.routledge.com/Understanding-BIM-The-Past-Present-and-Future/Ingram/p/book/9780367244187" target="_blank">Understanding BIM – The Past, Present and Future</a> and published by Routledge (it’s also <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Understanding-BIM-Past-Present-Future-ebook/dp/B08B9PMW4P" target="_blank">available via Amazon</a>). I haven’t read it myself, but it looks very interesting.</p><p>For those unfamiliar with Jonathan’s background, after working for some years on RUCAPS, he single-handedly coded <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonata_(building_design_software)" target="_blank">Sonata</a> and then went on to develop <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflex_(building_design_software)" target="_blank">Reflex</a>.</p><p>Something Jonathan mentioned during our chat – which I had absolutely no idea about – was that Autodesk very nearly bought Sonata back in 1987. Jonathan and members of his team met with Autodesk’s leadership in Sausalito early on October 19th 1987. The morning of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Monday_(1987)" target="_blank">Black Monday</a>. Here’s what happened to the Autodesk share price on that fateful day:</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20282e1029817200b-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="Black Monday 1987 - ADSK" border="0" height="327" src="/assets/image_105769.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="Black Monday 1987 - ADSK" width="500" /></a></p><p>The purchase was about to be finalised when the phone rang. Scan through to the 30-minute mark of this (also very interesting) video, to hear the story from Jonathan directly.</p><p style="text-align: center"><br /></p><p style="text-align: center"><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="283" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rHNezbVvkAc" title="YouTube video player" width="500"></iframe></p><p><br /></p><p>How different would the world be if the timing had been even slightly different? What if the sale had been finalised the week before? I’d love to hear your speculations in the comments. Just please stay polite. :-)</p>
