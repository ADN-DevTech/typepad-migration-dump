<p>I know this one is going to be <em>extremely</em> popular with the readers of this blog. While starting the clear-out of her bookshelf, a colleague in the Neuchatel office, Maria Elena Santoyo Torres, found a copy of <a href="http://fourmilab.ch/autofile/" target="_blank">The Autodesk File</a> in book form. I hadn’t realised it had been bound into a book, so this was really exciting to me! I admit to having been more than a little tempted to hang on to it for myself. Ah well.</p><p>(For those of you who are new to <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/one-mans-trash/" target="_blank">this series</a>, we’re using this blog to give away interesting items we’ve found while emptying the Neuchatel office, which will sadly be <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2017/12/the-end-of-an-era-for-autodesk-switzerland.html" target="_blank">closing its doors later this year</a>. So far we’ve found new homes – in Australia and the UK – for <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2018/02/one-mans-trash-an-rs-232-breakout-box.html" target="_blank">a couple of</a> <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2018/02/one-mans-trash-another-rs-232-breakout-box-sold.html" target="_blank">RS-232 breakout boxes</a> that our support techs used to troubleshoot digitizers and plotters back in the early 90s.)</p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b7c955e6cd970b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="589" title="The Autodesk File in physical form" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="The Autodesk File in physical form" src="/assets/image_359514.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p><a href="http://twitter.com/fourmilab" target="_blank">John Walker</a>, Autodesk’s founder and the book’s author, still lives in the area and has kindly agreed to sign the book for the lucky person who wins it. I say “win”, because I can’t bring myself to give something so precious to the first person who emails me… it has to be <em>earned</em>. And I think people will have a little fun, along the way.</p><p>John provided a couple of trivia questions to help raise the participation bar. The answer to the first – the main question in this competition – can be found in The Autodesk File itself.</p><blockquote><p><strong>What was the first Autodesk product which, after having been sold, was subsequently discontinued?</strong></p></blockquote><p>The second is much more challenging, so I don’t actually expect anyone to know this. As it’s such a stretch, I’m categorizing this question as being only for bonus points. Don’t feel as though you have to answer this one to be eligible for the book: although it certainly won’t hurt your chances if you do.<blockquote><p><strong>What was the original in-house name for the product eventually introduced as AutoSketch?</strong></p></blockquote><p>I’m going to have to make Autodesk employees and their families ineligible for this competition, even though it’ll probably make Shaan Hurley foam at the mouth. Sorry, Shaan, but if I can’t have it then none of my colleagues can, either. ;-)<p>So, if you want a chance at winning, please <a href="mailto:kean.walmsley@autodesk.com" target="_blank">email me</a> your response to the first question, above, by the end of the day on <strong>March 11th, 2018</strong>. I’ll put the names of all the people who responded correctly in a hat and get one of my kids to draw a single winner. If you manage to answer the second question correctly, too, then I’ll write your name on a slightly bigger piece of paper.<p>I’ll give the winner the chance to specify a person (probably the winner, themselves) to whom John will inscribe the book. Otherwise John can just sign it with his name, of course, if the winner prefers that. As a condition of entry I’ll ask the winner to send a photo of themselves with the book so that we can add it to this post. I’ll also publish the winner’s name alongside it.<p>That’s it for the rules of the competition. Here’s another photo, to whet your appetites.<p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b7c955e6d5970b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Another shot of the book" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Another shot of the book" src="/assets/image_872236.jpg" border="0"></a><p>Let the fun commence!
