<p>Happy New Year!!! I’m sure everyone’s thankful that 2020 is behind us (what a year that was). Let’s all hope 2021 is going to be at least somewhat better.</p>
<p>At the time I recorded this Floppy Friday, I hadn’t connected the dots on the date (i.e. that Friday was due to fall on New Year’s Day). So please do forgive it not being mentioned.</p>
<p>What I do mention is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman_%281986_video_game%29">Batman from 1986</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman_%281989_video_game%29">1989</a> – at the suggestion of Francesco Cappilli – as well as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkanoid">Arkanoid</a> and <a href="https://www.c64-wiki.de/wiki/Spacefighter">Spacefighter</a>. Enjoy!</p>
