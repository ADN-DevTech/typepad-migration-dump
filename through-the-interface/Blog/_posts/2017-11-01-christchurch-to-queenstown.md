<p>After spending <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2017/10/south-island.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">most of the day in Christchurch</a>, last Wednesday, we headed towards <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Tekapo" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Lake Tekapo</a>. Much of the drive was fairly flat and straight, so we made good progress despite starting out late. As we got closer to the lake the weather set in again, though – it started to rain fairly heavily – so we opted to stay in a place called Fairlie, which was half an hour closer than the lake. <a href="http://www.musterers.co.nz/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Musterers High Country Accommodation</a> ended up being a great place to stay: when we woke – thankfully to much better weather – we found ourselves basically on a farm with goats, sheep, donkeys and llamas.</p>
<p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201bb09d259f7970d-pi" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img alt="Donkeys" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_689326.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="Donkeys" width="500" /></a><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b8d2b9a250970c-pi" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img alt="Llamas grazing" border="0" height="154" src="/assets/image_269291.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="Llamas grazing" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>The kids (and their parents) loved it. A great start to the day.</p>
<p>We eventually headed on to Lake Tekapo, which was also fantastic…</p>
<p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b8d2b9a254970c-pi" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img alt="Lake Tekapo" border="0" height="141" src="/assets/image_782784.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="Lake Tekapo" width="500" /></a><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201bb09d25a00970d-pi" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img alt="A river feeding Lake Tekapo" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_851441.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="A river feeding Lake Tekapo" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>After enjoying the lakeside – visiting the little chapel down by the water, and enjoying a simple picnic on some nearby rocks – we decided to treat ourselves to a dip in the <a href="http://www.tekaposprings.co.nz/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Lake Tekapo Hot Springs</a>. While days are often warm(ish) in New Zealand at this time of year – we’re now properly in spring – the nights can often get really cold. A soak in warm pools was just what we needed to thaw our bones and prepare us for the following night.</p>
<p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b7c92f35e1970b-pi" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img alt="Soaking in the Lake Tekapo Hot Springs" border="0" height="281" src="/assets/image_248071.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="Soaking in the Lake Tekapo Hot Springs" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>As we’d warmed up nicely we ended up deciding to “freedom camp” that night, which meant going without power (and heat).</p>
<p>An aside about our camping rhythm: Our campervan is certified self-contained, which means we can camp pretty much anywhere they let you park overnight. That said, we generally find we need to camp somewhere with power every other night: without power you end up draining the “leisure battery” (a 12-volt system in addition to the one connected to the van’s normal electrics) fairly quickly, especially if you use the heating. And as we don’t like leaving the power connected overnight – we like the heat, but the transformer to charge the leisure battery is under one of the beds… we tried to sleep one night with power connected, and it was a disaster – we also don’t have as many hours connected to mains power as we otherwise might.</p>
<p>All this to say that we typically try to find a powered site every other night at a minimum. In Omarama – the town we stopped at after Lake Tekapo – we did check out a holiday park but its powered sites were on the pricey side, so we headed back to the Ahuriri Bridge Campsite – just a kilometre outside the town – to stay there. Which was just fine, and completely free.</p>
<p>Here’s a shot we took that night as we visited the dumping station in Omarama:</p>
<p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b8d2b9a3df970c-pi" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img alt="Mount Doom" border="0" height="99" src="/assets/image_367961.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="Mount Doom" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>After our stay by the Ahuriri Rover we continued on towards Queenstown. By this point it was Friday: we knew we had to drop the campervan back in Queenstown on Saturday morning and so decided we’d stop in Arrowtown for Friday night. A big thanks to <a href="http://c3dxtreme.blogspot.com.au/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Justin Ralston</a> for the <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2017/10/rotorua.html#comment-3583122464" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">great suggestions</a> about what to do there! They were extremely helpful.</p>
<p>The road to Arrowtown passes through the Lindis Valley – another beautiful place.</p>
<p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201bb09d25bf1970d-pi" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img alt="Lindis Valley" border="0" height="107" src="/assets/image_261384.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="Lindis Valley" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Nearing Arrowtown we saw a sign for <a href="https://www.goldfieldsmining.co.nz/tours/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Goldfields Mining Centre</a>. This looked like a lot of fun: we booked a tour and learned a lot about the local goldrushes of the 1850s and 1860s. The kids got to hold a few nuggets of gold, which they loved.</p>
<p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b8d2b9a3ec970c-pi" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img alt="Gold nuggets" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_34482.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="Gold nuggets" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>We even saw some old mining equipment that was (incredibly) still operational!</p>
<p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b7c92f3606970b-pi" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img alt="A grinding machine that feeds the resulting powder into a mercury amalgam" border="0" height="500" src="/assets/image_898359.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="A grinding machine that feeds the resulting powder into a mercury amalgam" width="375" /></a></p>
<p>After the tour – which was really interesting – we had the chance to try our hand at panning for gold. We shovelled some river rocks and mud into our pans and were shown how to gradually remove the waste material. One trick is to put a lead ball into the pan: lead has a specific gravity of 11, while gold’s is 19, which means that if you still have your lead ball at the end then any gold in the pan should be near it.</p>
<p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b7c92f360c970b-pi" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img alt="Kean panning for gold" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_76119.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="Kean panning for gold" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>It was great fun: I have to admit I was sceptical that any gold was actually in the river mud they had there, but I ended up finding a gold flake! Here it is next to my lead ball.</p>
<p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201bb09d25c18970d-pi" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img alt="My gold flake" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_327695.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="My gold flake" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>After this we headed into Arrowtown where – keeping with the mining theme – we visited the old <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrowtown_Chinese_Settlement" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Chinese Mining Settlement</a>. It was very interesting – and a little sad – to learn about the conditions these miners lived in when they came to New Zealand.</p>
<p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b7c92f365c970b-pi" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img alt="A building at the Chinese Mining Settlement in Arrowtown" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_445263.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="A building at the Chinese Mining Settlement in Arrowtown" width="500" /></a><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b7c92f362c970b-pi" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img alt="Another building at the Chinese Mining Settlement in Arrowtown" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_118557.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="Another building at the Chinese Mining Settlement in Arrowtown" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>We spent the night at <a href="http://arrowtownholidaypark.co.nz/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Arrowtown’s only campervan park</a> – which was really lovely – and then headed into Queenstown to drop the campervan off.</p>
<p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201bb09d28e29970d-pi" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img alt="Dropping off in Queenstown" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_709088.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="Dropping off in Queenstown" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>A few weeks ago we’d realised we weren’t going to have enough time in New Zealand, so we’d pushed our onwards flight to Sydney out by 3 days… from the 28th to the 31st. We couldn’t extend the campervan rental and so opted to stay in a hostel in central Queenstown: this was really a lot of fun – the <a href="http://www.aqhostel.co.nz/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Adventure Queenstown Hostel</a> regularly wins awards for being one of the best in New Zealand, and I can see why. It was great for the kids to get a feel for the backpacker lifestyle, so I’m really happy we did it.</p>
<p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b7c92f67b3970b-pi" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img alt="Hanging in the Adventure Queenstown Hostel" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_807088.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="Hanging in the Adventure Queenstown Hostel" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>It was strange (but actually great) to have proper beds again for a few nights. We toyed with various options – taking a tour to Milford Sound, taking the gondola up to get the view across the surrounding area – but in the end we just enjoyed the town of Queenstown, visiting the <a href="http://kiwibird.co.nz/kiwi/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Kiwi Birdlife Park</a> (where we could see kiwis feeding, as they have enclosures with the day and night cycles reversed so visitors could see these otherwise reclusive, nocturnal birds), exploring the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queenstown_Gardens" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">botanical gardens</a>, taking the <a href="https://www.realjourneys.co.nz/en/experiences/cruises/tss-earnslaw-steamship-cruises" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">TSS Earnslaw across Lake Wakatipu</a> to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Peak_(New_Zealand)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Walter Peak</a>, even trying the <a href="http://www.escapequest.co.nz/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">local escape room</a>. We knew there were lots of things we were missing out on, but that’s life. We had a great time with absolutely gorgeous weather, so we have no complaints at all about our choices in Queenstown.</p>

<p>On the last night we managed to catch up with Justin and Rachel Ralston for a quick drink. Thanks again for all the tips, Justin!</p>

<p>And so our New Zealand adventure comes to a close. We loved every bit of our 16 days here. We saw spectacular sights and had a warm welcome from all the people we met. There are a hundred more things we would have done if we’d had the time (and the energy), but these will have to wait for another trip. I have no doubt that we’ll be back.</p>
<p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b7c92f680e970b-pi" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img alt="Leaving New Zealand" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_753059.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="Leaving New Zealand" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>From here we’re in Australia for about two weeks, initially in Sydney and then back in a motorhome for the road trip from Brisbane to Cairns.</p>
