<p>Well, this just happened: after having had <a href="http://www.keanw.com/2018/08/registration-is-now-open-for-autodesk-university-forge-devcon-and-connect-construct-2018.html" target="_blank">three generative design-related classes accepted for AU 2018</a> (well, really two were accepted and one ended up getting a repeat slot at the Connect &amp; Construct pre-conference), I wasn’t due to talk about anything I’ve been doing lately with the Forge viewer. Which frankly was a shame, because between <a href="http://www.keanw.com/2018/09/animating-robots-in-the-forge-viewer.html" target="_blank">robots</a>, <a href="http://www.keanw.com/2018/09/when-in-rome.html" target="_blank">skeletons</a> and <a href="http://www.keanw.com/2018/09/displaying-streamlines-in-the-forge-viewer.html" target="_blank">streamlines</a>, as feel as though I’ve got lots of fun stuff to share, at the moment.</p><p>That was until yesterday, when I got pinged by Stephen Preston (for the US DevCon) and Cyrille Fauvel (for the European one), to ask if I’d be ready to speak at both events.</p><p>So I’m now in the official speaker line-up for both of the upcoming Forge DevCons – or should be soon. I’ve submitted a class entitled “<em>Robots, skeletons and streamlines… pushing the limits of the Forge viewer for 3D data visualization</em>” for the two events. I don’t have the confirmed time of either session, as yet, but if you’re coming to a DevCon in the coming month, please do your best to attend one. I promise there’ll be something of interest to everyone. :-)</p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad398399a200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="222" title="Robots, skeletons and streamlines" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Robots, skeletons and streamlines" src="/assets/image_851264.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Tomorrow I’m heading across to Basel to talk with Autodesk’s architecture customer council about knowledge management, so it looks as though I’ll be putting a slide deck for the European DevCon together on Monday’s train to Darmstadt. I’m now rather happy I opted for the 5.5 hour train journey, rather than shuttling to and from airports!</p>
