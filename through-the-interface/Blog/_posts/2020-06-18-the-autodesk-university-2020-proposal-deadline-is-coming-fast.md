<p>I’ve just realised that time is running out for people to <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/autodesk-university/conference/call-for-proposals">submit their class proposals for AU 2020</a>. The deadline is on <strong>June 22nd</strong>, which is this coming Monday.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20264e2e3710d200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="320" title="AU2020 CFP" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="AU2020 CFP" src="/assets/image_360096.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>From my side I’m almost certainly going to submit a class to discuss the details of <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2020/05/an-update-on-our-post-covid-office-layout-explorations.html">the work we’ve been doing on post-COVID return-to-workplace efforts</a>. Essentially digging into how we’ve used the Space Analysis package to implement metrics that make sense for this type of analysis.</p><p>If you’re thinking of submitting something, but haven’t yet put pen to paper (or rather fingers to keyboard), then I suggest giving it some thought over the weekend: Monday is the day you’re going to need to submit.</p><p>As this year’s AU events are all online, there are different ways of highlighting your work and expertise than just presenting something synchronously: this year you can also submit written content, for those of us who prefer the written medium to hearing our voices out loud (believe it or not this includes me, although I’m OK with presenting, too).</p><p>I’m very much looking forward to seeing how the AU team makes the transition to “full virtual”, this year. I’m pretty sure they’re going to find a way to bring the spirit of AU to many more people around the world, which is really exciting.</p>
