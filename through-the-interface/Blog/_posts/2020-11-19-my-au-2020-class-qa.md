<p>Yesterday evening was the Q&amp;A for my Autodesk University 2020 class, <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/autodesk-university/class/Lessons-Project-Dasher-Building-Digital-Twin-Using-Forge-2020" target="_blank">Lessons from Project Dasher: Building a Digital Twin Using Forge</a>.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2026be4252448200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="312" title="My first online AU class Q&amp;A" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="My first online AU class Q&amp;A" src="/assets/image_136993.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>People registered for AU you can use the above link to access the recording for the next 30 days.

It’s AU week, so I understood, and did my best to muddle through managing the questions. I went sometime before realising that unless I ignored – or changed the priority of the questions – they stayed at the top of the list. Once I understood this I managed to clear out the older comments – that I’d absolutely asked for, as at times I wasn’t sure things were working properly – from the 180+ questions in the list.</p><p>There were also some audio quirks – perhaps related to me wearing a shirt that brushed against the mic? – but I hope this didn’t prove too distracting for people.</p><p>The questions themselves were <strong><em>fantastic</em></strong>: I loved the engagement from people, and many questions were genuinely thought-provoking (perhaps too much so for me to do justice to on the spot). Thanks to all who attended and I really appreciate your patience.</p><p>I’ve just seen that for some reason a number of questions from the BIM Guru himself – Gavin Crump – didn’t show up until after the session was over. Sorry about that, Gav, I have no idea why you were being filtered! Anyway, here are the questions, which I’ll answer now:</p><blockquote><p>Hi Kean, Gav from Australia. Two questions, one formal, one not.<br>Formal - awesome to see Autodesk moving into the digital twin realm! Are there any key areas of change we should expect to see in the current BIM authoring/design tools (Revit,C3D,Inventor etc.) to better support this end of the BIM model useage, or will it mostly be handled via data wrangling and associations?<br>Informal - have you figured out why the joystick sticks on floppy friday?</p></blockquote><p>For the formal one: this is a great question! In the near-term I daresay there will be a fair bit of data-wrangling going on. My current experience with Autodesk Tandem is that it quickly shows up issues in the data – such as coordinate systems being misaligned – that will need fixing somewhere, whether in the authoring tool or in the Autodesk Tandem environment. A lot of issues can be fixed in Tandem, which is great, but others will need to be dealt with back in the authoring tool. Ideally some streamlined review/feedback mechanism would facilitate that, of course, and later on a change in the tooling or process would help address the data problems up-front… but these are things that are likely to bubble up as priorities as we head down this path.</p><p>For the informal one: I have not – I’m looking into getting a new old joystick, but for this week’s session (that I’m now going to record), I’ll be muddling on through, much as I did in yesterday’s Q&amp;A session. ;-)</p><p>If anyone has further questions relating to this class, then please do submit them as comments via the button on <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/autodesk-university/class/Lessons-Project-Dasher-Building-Digital-Twin-Using-Forge-2020" target="_blank">this page</a>.
