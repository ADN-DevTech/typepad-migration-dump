<p>I’m here, once again, for our annual Developer Day and DevLab, in between Paris (on Friday) and Farnborough (Monday and Tuesday). Others in the team are doing many more dates, so I have it easier, in many ways.</p>  <p>Just as I did, <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2010/12/arrived-in-mnchen.html" target="_blank">last year</a>, I ended up flying from GVA –&gt; ZRH –&gt; MUC to get here, mainly from a cost perspective (I fly back directly, MUC –&gt; GVA). This time, though, I took the train from Neuchâtel to Geneva and flew back across to Zürich’s new airport only to find my onwards flight to Munich had been cancelled. I had visions of having to get back on a train to Neuchâtel (essentially doing an afternoon trip around Switzerland), but luckily I was put on the last flight of the day to Munich, which meant getting to the hotel at midnight.</p>  <p>One other thing I tried, for the first time, was to go “green” on this trip (although just from the aspect of not printing any tickets – my carbon footprint was clearly not helped by the GVA –&gt; ZRH leg :-S). It ended up a “fail” at various levels, though: the Swiss Railways (SBB) app on my BlackBerry – which allows you to buy tickets from your phone and let them be scanned by the conductors – didn’t authorise properly with my online account, so I ended up buying an old-style ticket at the station. The Swiss (Airways) app that allows me to get my boarding pass locally worked really well (even going through security in Geneva, which felt strange), but then I was given a printed ticket when I was rescheduled. Bah.</p>  <p>I’ll post again on Friday, either with a special announcement (that my team and developers in Munich are also now aware of), or with an interesting side project that has just been sent my way.</p>
