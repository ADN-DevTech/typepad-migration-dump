<p>Some of you are probably aware of this activity from <a href="http://autodesk.blogs.com/between_the_lines/2014/04/3drv-tour-explores-the-future-of-how-things-are-designed-and-made.html" target="_blank">Shaan’s</a> and <a href="http://labs.blogs.com/its_alive_in_the_lab/2014/07/autodesk-3drv-continues-its-journey.html" target="_blank">Scott’s</a> blogs, but I thought it was overdue a mention here, too.</p>  <p>Autodesk is sponsoring <a href="http://news.autodesk.com/press-release/architecture-engineering-construction-civil-infrastructure-and-natural-resources/3drv-" target="_blank">the mother of all road trips</a>: over the course of 8 months, <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/tjmccue" target="_blank">TJ McCue</a> is travelling the length and breadth of the United States in a brightly decorated <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_vehicle" target="_blank">recreational vehicle (RV)</a>, spreading the word about 3D technology. TJ is talking to people around the country about <a href="http://realitycomputing.typepad.com/" target="_blank">reality computing</a> – capture, processing and fabrication processes such as 3D printing – as well as the availability of <a href="http://www.123dapp.com/" target="_blank">low-cost design tools</a>.</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201a73e01b61e970d-pi" target="_blank"><img title="TJ and the 3DRV" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 20px auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="TJ and the 3DRV" src="/assets/image_527990.jpg" width="454" height="191" /></a></p>  <p>TJ is documenting his travels and experiences on the <a href="http://3drv.com" target="_blank">3DRV.com</a> website: right now they’re in Connecticut, which is <a href="https://twitter.com/TJMcCue/status/499754500274798592" target="_blank">their 25th state</a>. The site makes for fascinating reading: <a href="http://3drv.com/blog/2014-07-03-lessons-from-the-roadtrip-update-one" target="_blank">this summary of the first 6 weeks</a> is a good place to start, but there’s a great deal of other really interesting content there, discussing topics such as <a href="http://3drv.com/blog/2014-07-13-u-s-navy-3d-prints-its-way-into-future" target="_blank">how the US Navy makes use of 3D printing</a> and <a href="http://3drv.com/blog/2014-06-13-dirty-socks-and-drones" target="_blank">some fun with flying – and finding – UAVs</a>.</p>  <p>I’ve always wanted to do a proper coast-to-coast road trip across the US, although I’m not sure I’d want to spend 8 months on the road (this one started in May and wraps up at the end of this year… totally hardcore). Looking at <a href="http://3drv.com/schedule" target="_blank">the schedule</a>, it looks – perhaps unsurprisingly – as though the 3DRV will be in Las Vegas for AU2014, so perhaps I’ll get the chance to see both the RV and TJ in person then.</p>  <p>A couple of quick updates that relate to this overall topic…</p>  <p>On <u>3D printing</u>… on Monday I spent a few hours working through an interesting <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course" target="_blank">MOOC</a> provided by Deloitte University Press: <a href="https://novoed.com/3d-opportunity/home" target="_blank">3D opportunity: The course on additive manufacturing for business leaders</a>.</p>  <p>The course is unfortunately pretty much over – the last day is August 17th, if you want to earn a certificate, although the material will remain available until August 31st, it seems – but I didn’t have the chance to go through it sooner. The good news is that the video lectures can be ripped through really quickly – I burned through them at 1.75X speed… when I watched one at normal speed I was stunned at how slowly everyone seemed to talk – and so it only took about 3 hours to work through the whole thing. Hopefully there’s still time for some of you to get the benefit of this course.</p>  <p>There are some quizzes to complete if you want to get a certificate of completion, as well as some optional written exercises that at this stage it’s too late to submit, of course. I found the course really interesting both from a technology – they spent some time looking at each of the technologies commonly being used for additive manufacturing – and a business – whether related to opportunities for product design or supply chain optimization – perspective. Very interesting stuff.</p>  <p>On <u>using UAVs for reality capture</u>… <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2014/08/our-holiday-on-andros.html" target="_blank">as reported last week</a>, I received <a href="https://store.3drobotics.com/products/bluetooth-data-link" target="_blank">the Bluetooth module</a> that will allow me to <a href="http://diydrones.com/profiles/blogs/adding-3dr-radio-telemetry-to-the-quanum-nova-apm-powered-copter" target="_blank">add telemetry</a> – and <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2014/06/autonomous-drone-navigation-for-autodesk-photo-on-recap-360.html" target="_blank">enable the use of DroidPlanner</a> for “<a href="http://diydrones.com/profiles/blogs/how-to-do-one-button-building-mapping-with-droidplanner" target="_blank">one button 3D capture</a>” – to <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2014/07/the-need-for-autonomous-drone-navigation.html" target="_blank">my Quanum Nova drone</a>. Sadly, though, it turns out that mine is part of a batch of misconfigured modules: <a href="http://3drobotics.com" target="_blank">3D Robotics</a> are sending a free replacement as soon as they have one in stock, but one hasn’t been shipped as yet. Presumably I could take the misconfigured one and <a href="http://diydrones.com/profiles/blog/show?id=705844%3ABlogPost%3A1645890" target="_blank">configure it myself</a> if I had <a href="http://store.3drobotics.com/products/ftdi-cable-3-3v" target="_blank">an FTDI cable</a>, but then it would probably take me as long to get the cable as the replacement module. More on this in due course…</p>
