<p>On Sunday night I hopped back across to Birmingham airport in the UK in order to visit the <a href="http://the-mtc.org" target="_blank">Manufacturing Technology Centre (MTC)</a> in Coventry on Monday. The weather has been gorgeous in the UK for the last month or more, so everything was a little parched. That, in combination with the fact England was still in the running for the World Cup, meant the country seemed imbued with optimism: seemingly welcome respite from the Brexit-related anguish the UK has been suffering since the EU referendum.</p><p>After a nice dinner with old friends and a quick sleep at a hotel, I took a taxi into the Birmingham office to await a colleague, Chris Jones, with whom I’d be visiting the MTC.</p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad380c314200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="345" title="Quick stop at Autodesk Birmingham" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Quick stop at Autodesk Birmingham" src="/assets/image_557072.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>It took us about 45 minutes to drive across to the MTC, where we were welcomed by Peter, Hannah and Tehseen.</p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad35ab8fb200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="The MTC" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="The MTC" src="/assets/image_415894.jpg" border="0"></a><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad35ab903200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="338" title="Bridging buildings" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Bridging buildings" src="/assets/image_705154.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p align="left">Here’s an introductory video that describes what the MTC is about:</p><p><br></p><p align="center"><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/218589002?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" webkitallowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><br></p><p>The main focus of our trip was to learn about T-ERA – the Thermal Energy Research Accelerator – and their “<a href="http://www.the-mtc.org/news-items/manufacturing-to-go-mtc-launches-factory-in-a-box-solution-for-industry" target="_blank">Factory in a Box</a>” (FIAB) project, with a view to us integrating <a href="http://dasher360.com" target="_blank">Dasher 360</a> into their toolchain.</p><p>Here’s a little background video specifically about T-ERA:</p><p align="center"><br></p><p align="center"><iframe width="500" height="284" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/5dy-b86zKx8?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media"></iframe></p><p><br></p><p>FIAB is a platform to create microfactories housed in shipping containers that can be deployed in a variety of situations where you want to maintain local manufacturing but don’t want the resource investment associated with building out fixed infrastructure. We had a tour around the first prototype FIAB – which was borne from a collaboration with Dearman, a company specializing in sustainable, mobile refrigeration systems – where the factory will bend and assemble cryogenic copper piping for vehicles’ cooling systems. This is just the first, though: there’s another FIAB project already in the works to manufacture a phase-change material for thermal energy storage, and the idea is clearly that FIAB will be a platform that can take on all kinds of manufacturing challenges.</p><p>I wasn’t able to take photos (or even have my phone) in the area where the FIAB prototype was being worked on: at some point I’m hoping to receive some approved FIAB photos from T-ERA that I’ll share in a follow-up post.</p><p>The topic of “configurable microfactories” is a hot one at Autodesk, right now. Members of the FIAB team travelled across for a symposium held at <a href="http://keanw.com/2014/03/pier-9.html" target="_blank">Pier 9</a> in June on this very subject.<p><p><br></p><p align="center"><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/279373649?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" webkitallowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p align="left"><br></p><p align="left">If you have an interest in the area of configurable microfactories and believe you have a project that would be interesting to work on with support from Autodesk, do consider <a href="https://www.autodesktechnologycenters.com" target="_blank">applying for a technology center residency</a>. These residencies are not funded, but residents do get access to technology and expertise that’s relevant to their field of interest.</p><p align="left">Beyond FIAB, the MTC has many other ongoing projects and the afternoon was an opportunity to learn about more of these. As a member of the MTC, Autodesk gets to attend regular Technical Advisory Board (TAB) meetings, and there happened to be one being held on the day I visited. It was a great opportunity to get an overview of the areas in which the MTC is working. Here’s a quick photo I took that relates to another area that’s keenly discussed at Autodesk, these days, the future of work.</p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad3a097a8200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="281" title="TAB and the MTC" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="TAB and the MTC" src="/assets/image_620965.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Having filled my brain with information, it was time for me to head homewards. I had a pint and a burger at the airport (a veggie burger with salad, rather than a Yorkshire pudding burger with chips ;-) before getting on my flight home.</p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad380c322200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="375" height="500" title="Dinner of champions (or not as it turns out)" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Dinner of champions (or not as it turns out)" src="/assets/image_694463.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>The sky was stunning as I landed in Zurich.</p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad380c32a200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Lovely sky arriving in Zurich" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Lovely sky arriving in Zurich" src="/assets/image_31017.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Next week I’ll be heading across to Berlin for the <a href="http://keanw.com/2018/07/just-a-few-weeks-until-the-aec-hackathon-in-berlin.html" target="_blank">AEC Hackathon</a>. I’ll also be stopping by our Potsdam office to meet with members of the InfraWorks team, which should be very interesting.</p>
