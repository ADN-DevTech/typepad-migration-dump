<p>This weekend I had a very strange task to perform: I had to book travel for work. Remembering how our corporate travel system worked was just one hurdle to cross – beyond that I had to deal with getting the appropriate management and travel department approvals, along with the fact I’ve booked a separate ticket for my 16-year old son to come along, and wanted to be 100% sure that we’re on the same flight. Was life really this complicated pre-pandemic? I’m sure I’ll get used to it all again, before long.</p><p>The reason I’m travelling is pretty exciting, at least. After various delays – mostly pandemic-related, but also due to issues such as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/05/world/europe/amsterdam-crumbling-infrastructure-canals.html" target="_blank">crumbling canal walls</a> – the <a href="https://mx3d.com/industries/infrastructure/smart-bridge/" target="_blank">MX3D smart bridge</a> is finally being installed over the canal in Amsterdam’s red-light district next week. As the “local” member of the Autodesk project team, I’ve volunteered to head up to the Netherlands and do what I can to help out. Which is likely to mostly mean taking photos and capturing videos, and perhaps doing the odd write-up for this blog.</p><p>Here are a few shots from the archives, to remind people what this awesome bridge looks like.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20282e10c5dfb200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="In the NDSM warehouse" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="In the NDSM warehouse" src="/assets/image_239024.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20282e10c5dff200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="With Gijs by the bridge" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="With Gijs by the bridge" src="/assets/image_373559.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202788033f433200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Before we had a floor" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Before we had a floor" src="/assets/image_795059.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>The big “coming out” event for the bridge was at Dutch Design Week in October 2018, where the project <a href="https://ddw.nl/en/news/234/mx3d-bridge-wins-public-award-at-dutch-design-awards-2018" target="_blank">won the Public Award</a>.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202788033f43c200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="During the day at DDW" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="During the day at DDW" src="/assets/image_65477.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20282e10c5e14200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Mike on the bridge" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Mike on the bridge" src="/assets/image_898666.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2026bdedc16c5200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Evening light" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Evening light" src="/assets/image_835901.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>My role is around the visualization of data coming off the bridge: there’s a much bigger team – within Autodesk Research and the other partner companies engaged in the project – working on aspects such as the sensor network, the camera-based computer vision pipeline, and the database technology, so my involvement is fairly localised.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2026bdedc182e200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="312" title="Heatmaps for the MX3D bridge large" style="margin: 30px auto; float: none; display: block;" alt="Heatmaps for the MX3D bridge large" src="/assets/image_407414.jpg"></a></p><p>With some luck within the coming weeks we’ll be able to deliver this kind of visualization based on live data coming off the bridge in <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/w4WRmp9onUtEMCUf7" target="_blank">it’s new location</a>. Here’s what its predecessor looks like, in case you’re wondering, courtesy of Google Maps:</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2026bdedc1821200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="312" title="The old bridge" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="The old bridge" src="/assets/image_867587.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>My understanding is that there isn’t currently a bridge in place at this location, but all that should change in a week’s time!</p>
