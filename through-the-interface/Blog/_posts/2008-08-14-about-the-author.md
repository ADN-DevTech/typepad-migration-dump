<p><strong>Kean Walmsley</strong></p>
<p>Kean works at Autodesk Research, based in Neuchâtel, Switzerland.</p>
<p>He&nbsp;joined Autodesk in 1995 and has worked in a number of Autodesk offices around the world – in the UK, the US, India and Switzerland – and in a number of roles, both technical and management-focused. He spent several years working in the Autodesk Developer Network and four years as a Software Architect for the AutoCAD product line.</p>
<p>In 2006 Kean started this blog, through which he enjoys a regular dialog with software developers working with Autodesk technologies. He also uses it&nbsp;to share his research into how Autodesk technologies connect with emerging industry trends, such as reality capture, natural user interfaces, virtual reality, and the internet of things.</p>
<p>Kean can be contacted <a href="mailto:kean.walmsley@autodesk.com">by email</a>, but please don't expect him to provide support: if you need support for our products or APIs, please visit Autodesk's <a href="http://support.autodesk.com/">support website</a>, use our <a href="http://discussion.autodesk.com/">discussion groups</a> or post a question via your reseller or the <a href="http://adn.autodesk.com/">Autodesk Developer Network website</a>, if you're a member.</p>
<p>Here's a video introduction recorded by Kean, although this describes his previous role and really needs updating.</p>
