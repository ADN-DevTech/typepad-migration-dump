<p>The dates and location were announced for the SF edition of the Autodesk DevCon 2023 <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2023/05/register-today-for-autodesk-devcon-2023-in-sf.html" target="_blank">a few weeks ago</a>, and now <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jim-quanci-13a695_register-for-autodesk-devcon-2023-activity-7069804590321340417-nCHC" target="_blank">it’s Europe’s turn</a>.</p><p>Join the Autodesk team in Munich on September 11th and 12th at the Holiday Inn Munich-Westpark. Registration hasn’t yet opened, so right now it’s just about putting the dates in your diaries and (potentially) planning travel/accommodation. I expect to come across to be there – it’ll be great to catch up with everyone!</p><p>As I couldn’t remember the location, off the top of my head, I went ahead and searched my Google Photos for the venue and it tells me we were there early in 2016, at the tail-end of the DevDays 2015 tour. As I’d shared a few photos taken from the SF-based Forge DevCon at Fort Mason in my other announcement post, it seemed right to share some from the Munich event in 2016 here.</p><p>It’s fun to see the logos Jim presented, at the time, when talking about web technology: honestly most are still relevant today, although a few front-end frameworks (e.g. React and Vue.js) have become very popular since.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202b685391169200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="281" title="Jim Quanci talking web tech" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Jim Quanci talking web tech" src="/assets/image_889094.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>I hope we get a nice full room in September, once again.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202b68539116d200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="281" title="Cyrille Fauvel presenting in 2016" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Cyrille Fauvel presenting in 2016" src="/assets/image_201693.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Perhaps the most memorable demo of that tour (and perhaps any DevDays tour!) was Cyrille’s IoT-enabled home. I do have a video of Jim controlling the shutters from the Forge Viewer (as it was known, back then), but here’s an additional still image I snapped.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202b685391172200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="281" title="Cyrille's IoT home" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Cyrille's IoT home" src="/assets/image_516534.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>I’ll post again once when registration opens up: <a href="https://aps.autodesk.com/blog/register-autodesk-devcon-2023" target="_blank">the main APS blog post</a> has already been updated with the Munich information, so it’s good to bookmark that in the meantime. See you in Munich!</p>
