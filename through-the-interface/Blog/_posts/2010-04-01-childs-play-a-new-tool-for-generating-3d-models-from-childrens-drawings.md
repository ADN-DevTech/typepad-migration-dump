<p>On the heels of hot products such as <a href="http://photosynth.net/" target="_blank">Photosynth</a>, which generates 3D point clouds from 2D photos, expect to see (any day, now) a new product on <a href="http://labs.autodesk.com" target="_blank">Autodesk Labs</a> called Child’s Play. This innovative, cloud-based design engine processes images drawn by children and cranks out 3D models to be imported into AutoCAD or Revit.</p>
<p>We&#39;ve had a team of PhDs in our Shanghai R&amp;D centre spending man-years implementing cutting-edge algorithms that can effectively take any simple line drawing - irrespective of your child&#39;s&#0160;ability with a pen&#0160;- and create a 3D model of a house meeting local building standards. Quite an achievement, I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll agree.</p>
<p>We’ve started with the building industry, but I can certainly see this technology being adapted to the design of cars, planes and even space-craft.</p>
<p>Harness the talents of the next generation! Reduce your labour costs! 3D modelling is now Child’s Play!</p>
