<p>So far it’s been a great few days in Montreal at this year’s Autodesk Tech Summit. The event just keeps getting bigger: we’re now up to 750 attendees over a 3-day conference with around 150 speakers.</p> <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201bb090733a1970d-pi" target="_blank"><img title="A big crowd" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 30px auto; border-left: 0px; display: block; padding-right: 0px" border="0" alt="A big crowd" src="/assets/image_838368.jpg" width="504" height="286"></a></p> <p>I spoke on the first day about using the View &amp; Data API to enable VR – something I’ll be talking about again at the <a href="http://forge.autodesk.com/conference" target="_blank">Forge DevCon</a>, for external attendees. I’m happy with how the session went – it was a fun crowd. Here’s a selfie posted by a couple of people who came along…</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b7c863a7dc970b-pi" target="_blank"><img title="Boys having fun" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 30px auto; border-left: 0px; display: block; padding-right: 0px" border="0" alt="Boys having fun" src="/assets/image_471214.jpg" width="324" height="281"></a></p> <p>The rest of the day was spent in other people’s sessions, whether on Generative Design, micro-service architectures or mobile rendering engines. All very interesting and worthwhile.</p> <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b8d1ed7394970c-pi" target="_blank"><img title="Sensors" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 30px auto; border-left: 0px; display: block; padding-right: 0px" border="0" alt="Sensors" src="/assets/image_718532.jpg" width="504" height="379"></a></p> <p>The second day of the conference was spent at the IoT Hackday, which my team hosted. I’d put together a simple custom Dynamo node that connects Dynamo Studio to our IoT back-end (I talked about this <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2016/05/connecting-dynamo-to-the-internet-of-things.html" target="_blank">last week</a>), so I spent some time demoing that and supporting people integrating it into their projects. It was gratifying to see a number of the teams using it – including “Mr. Dynamo” himself, <a href="https://twitter.com/ikeough" target="_blank">Ian Keough</a>.</p> <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b7c863a7e6970b-pi" target="_blank"><img title="Ian Keough multi-tasking" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 30px auto; border-left: 0px; display: block; padding-right: 0px" border="0" alt="Ian Keough multi-tasking" src="/assets/image_997695.jpg" width="496" height="281"></a></p> <p>There were some great projects: many used Node-RED on the front-end to trigger actions based on the sensor data streaming in via a Raspberry Pi, feeding our back-end with historical data that could be picked up and used in a geometric Dynamo model. And do important things as send messages to Slack, of course.</p> <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b7c863a7eb970b-pi" target="_blank"><img title="Sensors driving Dynamo" style="float: none; margin: 30px auto; display: block" alt="Sensors driving Dynamo" src="/assets/image_537267.jpg" width="500" height="282"></a></p>   <p>We’re now entering the third day. I’ll be back attending technical sessions again, today, before spending the day tomorrow at Autodesk Montreal.</p>
