<p>My wife and I celebrated <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2021/11/an-interview-and-an-anniversary.html" target="_blank">our 20th wedding anniversary back in November</a>. We celebrated as a family with our three great kids making vegan sushi for us all. At the time my wife said that there was a present on its way, but that it may take a while. I didn’t think much of it, until this weekend.</p><p>On Saturday I was told “you need to get an early night, as tomorrow we’re leaving for our anniversary surprise at 5am.” At the time it didn’t seem like much of a gift – getting out of bed at 5am isn’t the easiest thing for a family comprising three teenagers to do (and that’s as much down to me as it is the kids, in fairness). But we managed and were on the road up to the Val-de-Ruz by 5:10am.</p><p>We arrived at the same time as a car pulling a trailer, at which point we all figured out what was in store: a trip in a “Montgolfière” (this is the French term for a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_air_balloon" target="_blank">hot air balloon</a>, named after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montgolfier_brothers" target="_blank">the aviation pioneers who invented this mode of transport</a>). My wife had been working to make this happen since November, but for various reasons it ended up being delayed to our 20½th anniversary, give or take.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202942fac2ea1200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Arriving" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Arriving" src="/assets/image_664965.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>The last time I’d gone in one of these was in Napa Valley, back when we lived in the US. It was a very different experience, as you just rolled up and got in the balloon. This time (much to our genuine delight) we helped with the process to assemble and inflate the balloon.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202942fac2ea9200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Unloading" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Unloading" src="/assets/image_803982.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>The equipment was surprisingly compact, considering.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20282e156fd98200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="All very compact" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="All very compact" src="/assets/image_177285.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>The sun had still not risen, at this point. It wasn’t cold, just atmospheric.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20278807e7967200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Enjoying the pre-dawn twilight" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Enjoying the pre-dawn twilight" src="/assets/image_630560.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>The first step was to assemble the basket with the burners and the supports.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20282e156fda4200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Setting up the basket" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Setting up the basket" src="/assets/image_762298.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>The next step was to unfold the canopy.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20282e156fdaf200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Unpacking the canopy" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Unpacking the canopy" src="/assets/image_557060.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>This needed unpacking, with the various ties removed.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20282e156fdb7200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Canopy unpacked" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Canopy unpacked" src="/assets/image_222950.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>At which point it could be stretched outwards.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20282e156fdbc200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Stretching it out" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Stretching it out" src="/assets/image_774183.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Once fully stretched out, it was ready to be inflated.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20282e156fdc3200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Ready to inflate" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Ready to inflate" src="/assets/image_488626.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>A large fan was used to fill the canopy with cool air.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202942fac2ec2200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="281" title="Thar she blows" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Thar she blows" src="/assets/image_785254.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Once fully inflated it was time to heat the air.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20282e156fdce200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Nearly there" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Nearly there" src="/assets/image_732888.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>This was done with an extra gas canister – rather than using gas from one of the four canisters that would be used during the flight. Here’s a video showing the process.</p><p align="center"><br></p><p align="center"><iframe width="500" height="283" title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YvggNdimD3k" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"></iframe></p><p><br></p><p>This is a photo showing the burners in action, something that happened on and off during the flight (of course).</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202942fac2eca200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Adding some heat" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Adding some heat" src="/assets/image_528209.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Then we were off! The lift-off was smooth, and we soon had a lovely view across the surrounding area. We had the sound of cow-bells as went up – all that was missing was a group of yodelers accompanied by the Alpenhorn.</p><p>As the balloon could only hold four people at a time – including the pilot – we had to go up in two groups. As we also needed to have someone to drive our car to follow the balloon’s journey, this also meant that my wife and I couldn’t go up together this time. Ah well.</p><p>I ended up going up with our two younger kids, while my wife went up with our two eldest (our middle child won the coin toss and so got to go up twice).</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202942fac2ecf200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Up up and away" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Up up and away" src="/assets/image_550832.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>The slight haze in the distance just made the experience more magical.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202942fac2ed7200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Still a touch misty" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Still a touch misty" src="/assets/image_852573.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>The view just kept on getting more and more impressive. I do suffer from vertigo, but somehow this wasn’t so bad. I think it has to do with your feet being on a solid surface throughout… I just made sure I had an arm around a support whenever I felt wobbly.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202942fac2f29200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="The patchwork of fields" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="The patchwork of fields" src="/assets/image_738461.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Here’s a panorama of the area.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202942fac2f2d200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="131" title="A panoramic view" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="A panoramic view" src="/assets/image_487609.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>It was lovely to see Lake Neuchatel, when we got high enough.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20278807e7c10200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Looking across to Lake Neuchatel" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Looking across to Lake Neuchatel" src="/assets/image_890317.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>At one point we could see all three lakes in our region: Biel, Murten and Neuchatel. We couldn’t see the Alps – there’s another <a href="https://www.thelocal.ch/20220315/dust-from-the-sahara-desert-covers-parts-of-switzerland/" target="_blank">dust cloud from the Sahara</a> that unfortunately made it a little hazy, although still quite beautiful.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20278807e7a16200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="The 3 lakes - Biel, Neuchatel and Murten" style="margin: 30px auto;
