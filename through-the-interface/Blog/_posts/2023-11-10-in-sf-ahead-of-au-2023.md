<p>On Wednesday I headed back across to Zurich airport to fly to San Francisco for a few days ahead of Autodesk University 2023 in Las Vegas.<a href="/assets/image_497098.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Waking up" src="/assets/image_497098.jpg" alt="Waking up" width="375" height="500" border="0" /></a>The flight was direct and largely uneventful: I didn't sleep but did feel moderately sane when I arrived in SF. I hopped on BART from the airport to Embarcadero - it's really the best mode of transport if you arrive around 5pm.<a href="/assets/image_15807.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="View from BART" src="/assets/image_15807.jpg" alt="View from BART" width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a>My room in the Hyatt has a view across SF’s financial district. Here’s a picture I snapped before sleeping...  </p>

<p>… and one on waking.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_696326.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="By day" src="/assets/image_696326.jpg" alt="By day" width="375" height="500" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>I always like seeing the view towards The Bay, too.<a href="/assets/image_795823.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="View towards The Bay" src="/assets/image_795823.jpg" alt="View towards The Bay" width="375" height="500" border="0" /></a>Thursday was split between Pier 9 and 1 Market.</p>
<p>After a few internal meetings I was thrilled to finally get to walk across the Pier 9 bridge. I talk about the instrumentation of this bridge - and it's importance to the MX3D project - all the time, but it was incredibly the first time I'd walked on it.<a href="/assets/image_623745.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><br /><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Me on the bridge" src="/assets/image_623745.jpg" alt="Me on the bridge" width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Here I am with Hans Kellner - who was heavily involved in the instrumentation work - and Jacky Bibliowicz - who was the driving force behind the back-end time-series data storage.<a href="/assets/image_838777.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Kean, Hans and Jacky on the bridge" src="/assets/image_838777.jpg" alt="Kean Hans and Jacky on the bridge" width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>I've always wanted to try this, but sadly it turns out I'm too short. (And - I hate to say - heavy.)</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="/assets/image_121581.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83452464869e202c8d3a2c1fa200d img-responsive" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Swinging Hans" src="/assets/image_121581.jpg" alt="Swinging Hans" width="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Hans pointed out some interesting features of the bridge.<a href="/assets/image_287209.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Hans pointing things out" src="/assets/image_287209.jpg" alt="Hans pointing things out" width="375" height="500" border="0" /></a>There were several 3D-printed brackets - each of them designed for different loads, which was neat.<a href="/assets/image_165598.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Custom 3D-printed supports" src="/assets/image_165598.jpg" alt="Custom 3D printed supports" width="375" height="500" border="0" /></a></p>

<p>Dagmara Szkurlat joined us for an “us-ie”.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_128720.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="On the bridge" src="/assets/image_128720.jpg" alt="On the bridge" width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>The Pier 9 office has some really nice areas and a spectacular view. It's really a great place to work.<a href="/assets/image_383487.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="A quiet spot with a view over the Bay Bridge" src="/assets/image_383487.jpg" alt="A quiet spot with a view over the Bay Bridge" width="375" height="500" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>And the equipment is very impressive. There were various prints on display that were made in the workshop.<a href="/assets/image_929735.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Exhibit of 3D prints etc." src="/assets/image_929735.jpg" alt="Exhibit of 3D prints etc" width="375" height="500" border="0" /></a><a href="/assets/image_592409.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="More 3D prints" src="/assets/image_592409.jpg" alt="More 3D prints" width="375" height="500" border="0" /></a>After the meetings were over we headed to lunch together.<a href="/assets/image_628265.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Heading for lunch from Pier 9" src="/assets/image_628265.jpg" alt="Heading for lunch from Pier 9" width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a>We chose a nice Peruvian spot halfway between the Pier and 1 Market. I ordered a chicha morada - the first I'd had since our round-the-world trip back in 2016-7 - but it wasn't at all the same.<a href="/assets/image_808586.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Chicha morada kinda" src="/assets/image_808586.jpg" alt="Chicha morada kinda" width="375" height="500" border="0" /></a>The food was very good, though.<a href="/assets/image_77964.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="The team at lunch in la Mar" src="/assets/image_77964.jpg" alt="The team at lunch in la Mar" width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a>We managed to pay and head across to the 1 Market Street office just in time for our meeting with Sherri from The Gallery team.<a href="/assets/image_795506.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Entering The Gallery" src="/assets/image_795506.jpg" alt="Entering The Gallery" width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a>I'd worked with Sherri back when The Gallery was renovated, mainly for the NEST exhibit. Sherri showed us the AR experience that Hans had helped implement.<a href="/assets/image_320824.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="The AR experience" src="/assets/image_320824.jpg" alt="The AR experience" width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a>The Gallery was hosting an internal team event during our visit, so I only managed to take photos from the one side.<a href="/assets/image_967773.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="NEST cutout" src="/assets/image_967773.jpg" alt="NEST cutout" width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a>It was great to see it in person, in any case.<a href="/assets/image_201501.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="NEST from the side" src="/assets/image_201501.jpg" alt="NEST from the side" width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a><a href="/assets/image_900140.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Me at the NEST" src="/assets/image_900140.jpg" alt="Me at the NEST" width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>There were several other Autodesk Research projects on display, too, of course.<a href="/assets/image_734695.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="The NASA JPL lander" src="/assets/image_734695.jpg" alt="The NASA JPL lander" width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>It was nice to talk about The Gallery with a member of the team who created it.<a href="/assets/image_632872.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Chatting with Sherri in The Gallery" src="/assets/image_632872.jpg" alt="Chatting with Sherri in The Gallery" width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a>As the event was getting noisier, we headed across into another part of 1 Market to get some quiet. This space definitely fitted the bill.<a href="/assets/image_345139.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="A gorgeous room" src="/assets/image_345139.jpg" alt="A gorgeous room" width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a><a href="/assets/image_170583.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Social area" src="/assets/image_170583.jpg" alt="Social area" width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a><a href="/assets/image_397581.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Lots of greenery" src="/assets/image_397581.jpg" alt="Lots of greenery" width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_637781.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Views onto Market Street" src="/assets/image_637781.jpg" alt="Views onto Market Street" width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a>At 3pm there was a Diwali celebration in the office, where I managed to catch up with some old friends.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_371623.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Diwali celebrations at 1 Market" src="/assets/image_371623.jpg" alt="Diwali celebrations at 1 Market" width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a>It was great to see various performances by members of the Indian community at Autodesk SF.<a href="/assets/image_245847.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Dancing at Diwali" src="/assets/image_245847.jpg" alt="Dancing at Diwali" width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>I did’t end up leaving feedback, but suffice to say I’d have mashed the left-hand button.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_17943.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Very satisfied" src="/assets/image_17943.jpg" alt="Very satisfied" width="375" height="500" border="0" /></a>After this I had the chance to catch up with Pete Heald and Clayton Hotson, both of whom I've known for more than 20 years. It was great to catch up.<a href="/assets/image_60060.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Pete and Clayton" src="/assets/image_60060.jpg" alt="Pete and Clayton" width="375" height="500" border="0" /></a>Another old friend is Elise Youmans, who also took the time in a very busy week to join us for drinks.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_228140.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="The crew at Gotts" src="/assets/image_228140.jpg" alt="The crew at Gotts" width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a>It was a lovely day spent in SF. On Friday we’re heading to Stanford University for some meetings, so we didn’t have a very late night, which I’m also happy about.</p>
