<p>I’m a little late to the announcement party on this one – as I was busy gushing about <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2021/07/the-mx3d-bridge-opens-to-the-public.html" target="_blank">the</a> <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2021/07/data-from-the-mx3d-smart-bridge.html" target="_blank">MX3D</a> <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2021/07/the-mx3d-bridge-and-its-colours.html" target="_blank">bridge</a>, last week – but it does still feel like it’s worth posting a reminder to people.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20278803b4b71200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="280" title="Forge at AU2021" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Forge at AU2021" src="/assets/image_213274.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>While it may seem like a long way away – as the event itself is in early October – it certainly doesn’t hurt to <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/autodesk-university/conference/overview" target="_blank">register early for AU</a>, even when it’s free, virtual and with no restrictions on the number of participants (at least none that I’m aware of).</p><p>The Forge team, for instance, has a number of plans to engage with the development community ahead of the event: check <a href="https://forge.autodesk.com/blog/what-going-forge-autodesk-university-2021" target="_blank">this blog post for details</a>. I see there’s an online bootcamp for developers planned for mid-September, as well as another Forge Hackathon (yay!) during the week before AU.</p><p>I don’t have any classes planned for this year’s AU – a very strange feeling, as the only one I’ve skipped since the early 2000s was because I was <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2017/11/airlie-beach-to-cairns-and-the-great-barrier-reef.html" target="_blank">travelling with my family</a> <a href="https://www.keanw.com/round-the-world" target="_blank">back in 2017</a> – but I do expect to participate in some way. I’m considering proposing some kind of meetup of some kind: perhaps for people interested in Forge-based Digital Twins or something related to learning more about Autodesk Research.&nbsp; We’ll see.</p><p>In the meantime, do go ahead and register for AU: it’s a good idea to engage early, as there’ll be lots of good stuff coming between now and the event!</p>
