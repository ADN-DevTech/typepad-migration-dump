<p>Tomorrow is April 30th, which brings to a close the <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2024/04/the-au-2024-call-for-proposals-is-open.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Call for Proposals for Autodesk University 2024</a>, which is being held in San Diego from October 15-17.</p>
<p>To get you excited, here are a few images taken by one of the official AU photographers. And yes, it’s at least as cool as it looks in the photos, so do make sure you submit your proposal before tomorrow’s deadline.<a href="/assets/image_791466.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="AU 2023" src="/assets/image_791466.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a>

Let’s see if it makes the cut.</p>
<p>Hopefully see you in San Diego!</p>
