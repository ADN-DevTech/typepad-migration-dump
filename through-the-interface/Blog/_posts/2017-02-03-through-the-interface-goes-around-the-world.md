<p>I have some big news. My wife and I have decided to take our three children out of school for a semester and travel around the world for six months. We’ll be leaving at the beginning of July and spending a month in each of North America, South America, the South Pacific, ANZ, South Asia and South Africa, returning at the beginning of 2018. This is the reason I’m likely to be skipping AU 2017 and this year’s Forge DevCon, by the way. So it goes.</p> <p>During the trip my wife will be “road schooling” the kids for a couple of days per week – and I’ll be dropping down to a 50% schedule for Autodesk – so you should expect to see this blog continue: in fact I plan on using the trip to meet with Autodesk customers and developers in all kinds of interesting places. I’m particularly interested in talking to people about Forge and its use with emerging technology such as AR, VR and IoT. I’m even considering bringing a HoloLens with me – we’ll have to see how the packing goes.</p> <p>On the personal side, you’ll probably get to know a little more about my family during the course of the 6 months (a subject I’ve tended to avoid blogging about, until now, mainly out of respect for their privacy). One way or another it’s going to be a really interesting journey. :-)</p> <p>We haven’t yet bought our plane tickets: we have the broad strokes worked out, but there’s still a fair amount of wiggle-room in terms of both the route and the schedule.</p> <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b7c8d1a908970b-pi" target="_blank"><img title="Around the world, around the wor-uld" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 30px auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="Around the world, around the wor-uld" src="/assets/image_241283.jpg" width="500" height="244"></a></p> <p>So if you’re interested in helping plan our trip, in some way – perhaps suggesting a “must see” location, whether personal or professional – please do post a comment here or <a href="mailto:kean.walmsley@autodesk.com" target="_blank">send me an email</a>.</p>
