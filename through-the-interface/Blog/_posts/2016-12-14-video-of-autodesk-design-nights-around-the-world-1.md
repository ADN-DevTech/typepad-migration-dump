<p>I was just sent this video (thanks, <a href="https://twitter.com/Aurelia_GF" target="_blank">Aurelia</a>!) featuring scenes from the amazing Design Nights Autodesk has held around the world. Yes, including the one we organised here in Neuchatel, Switzerland.</p> <p align="center">&nbsp;</p> <p align="center"><iframe height="281" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3BHvpxkZyFU?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" width="500" allowfullscreen></iframe></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>I’ve had a pretty hectic start to the week, so this is (unusually, as it’s Wednesday) my first post. But I have quite a bit to talk about, so it won’t be my last.</p> <p>Right now I’m heading off to see Rogue One at the cinema: once again a Star Wars film is being released in French-speaking Switzerland two full days ahead of its US release date, but I promise not to post any spoilers. I will say I’m really excited, though!</p>
