<p>Like many of you (with some countries unfortunately having been excluded due to privacy regulations) I’ve just received an awesome customized video about this year’s Autodesk University. <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/autodesk-university/las-vegas/message-for-you?vyemail=kean.walmsley@autodesk.com&amp;vycustom_id=uNnv2GiHRPdKBJRKPFKTik&amp;mkt_tok=eyJpIjoiWkdaa01EZGhZakV6TnprNCIsInQiOiJjcDlYY0RTWWZ2MSthV2RmajA4T081VVFkV3c3XC9meXFURjA1K2FMZzJJbXg5bktlNzh3eG5RTzk1aUI3UTRtQmxJTG5tQTEwMFltYXBtUDFwdlJ3VXpZeUhUVFA2TENzclhqSUlxNDMzcnYzQmhTd3h4NjNTcnlINVFRempvXC92In0%3D" target="_blank">Here’s a link to the one I received, in case you didn’t get one yourself.</a> I’m guessing they didn’t actually record a custom video – perhaps by training an infinite number of monkey videographers – to make this. Anyway – it was a great job, however it was done.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad3a373c8200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="281" title="A still from the customized AU video" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="A still from the customized AU video" src="/assets/image_57500.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>The video was to announce a <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/autodesk-university" target="_blank">new web platform for AU content</a>, including the recordings from this year’s event.</p><p>Of my classes two were recorded (the pre-conference sessions, including <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/autodesk-university/forge-content/au_class-urn%3Aadsk.content%3Acontent%3A12a977f8-3790-43e6-918d-e45dc95f0e0f" target="_blank">this one</a>, unfortunately were not). Here’s <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/autodesk-university/class/Generative-Urban-Design-collaboration-between-Autodesk-Research-and-Van-Wijnen-2018-0" target="_blank">one of the sessions I co-presented</a> with <a href="https://twitter.com/lorenzovillaggi" target="_blank">Lorenzo Villaggi</a> from The Living:</p><p align="center"><br></p><p align="center"><iframe width="500" height="283" src="https://player.ooyala.com/static/v4/production/latest/skin-plugin/iframe.html?ec=w0dzhvZzE6U5BgkUokxObHgCHya_km3N&amp;pbid=e7917642de4a4f1eae0a331375e03784&amp;pcode=o3OG46qoFLfL76WkTkb1a9k23qBd&amp;inline={}" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><br></p><p>Here’s the <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/autodesk-university/class/Getting-Started-Generative-Design-AEC-2018" target="_blank">“Getting Started with Generative Design for AEC</a>” session – all about Project Refinery – that I delivered solo:</p><p align="center"><br></p><p align="center"><iframe width="500" height="283" src="https://player.ooyala.com/static/v4/production/latest/skin-plugin/iframe.html?ec=I1YmRuZzE6iieImDHgYXrU-N8Sc9d4MP&amp;pbid=e7917642de4a4f1eae0a331375e03784&amp;pcode=o3OG46qoFLfL76WkTkb1a9k23qBd&amp;inline={}" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><br></p><p>To wrap up this post, here's a nice video from my friend and Toronto colleague, Ramtin Attar, who did a great job of capturing the feel of this year's event:</p><p align="center"><br></p><p align="center"><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/303076343?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" webkitallowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><br></p><p>Now that I've caught my breath, I can look back on what was a great AU. It’s always a little difficult to assess, at the time – there’s just so much running about – but I enjoyed this one immensely. I did feel the scale of the event, with upwards of 11,000 people… there were lots of people whose paths I usually cross but somehow didn’t, but that’s how these things go. Next year’s will come around, soon enough!</p>
