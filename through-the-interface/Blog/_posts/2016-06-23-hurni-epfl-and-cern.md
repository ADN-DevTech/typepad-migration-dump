<p>After a hectic <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2016/06/first-day-at-the-forge-devcon.html" target="_blank">week</a> <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2016/06/second-day-at-the-forge-devcon.html" target="_blank">in SF</a>, I was looking forward to some relaxation, <a href="https://twitter.com/keanw/status/744568942648262657" target="_blank">back in Switzerland</a>, despite having a few visits planned for this week. It didn’t quite work out that way, but it was all for the best.</p> <p>On Tuesday I spent most of the day with <a href="http://www.hurni.ch" target="_blank">Hurni Engineering</a>, a very close partner based in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Chaux-de-Fonds" target="_blank">La Chaux-de-Fonds</a>, the centre of the watchmaking industry – and the home of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Corbusier" target="_blank">Le Corbusier</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Chevrolet" target="_blank">Louis Chevrolet</a> – in Switzerland. I visited alongside Martin von Wartburg (our manufacturing industry salesperson for Switzerland) and Peter Schlipf (the Forge Partner Development Manager for EMEA). It was a fun and interesting visit: we spent much of the time discussing Forge and going through possible scenarios for applications. Including my favourites, IoT and VR. :-)</p> <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b8d1fc3f5c970c-pi" target="_blank"><img title="Our friends at Hurni Engineering" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 30px auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="Our friends at Hurni Engineering" src="/assets/image_381141.jpg" width="504" height="285"></a></p> <p>Our visit happened after popping by Patek Philippe – we didn’t actually visit their office, just looked at the outside – as Peter captured in this tweet:</p> <center> <p>&nbsp;</p> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr" align="left">Starting our tour de Swiss in La Chaux-de-Fonds before visiting Hurni Engineering seen Patek Philippe <a href="https://t.co/NPtPg0JNMp">pic.twitter.com/NPtPg0JNMp</a></p> <p align="left">— Peter Schlipf (@PeterSchlipf) <a href="https://twitter.com/PeterSchlipf/status/745188033922732032">June 21, 2016</a></p></blockquote> <p>&nbsp;</p></center> <p>On Wednesday I offered to take Peter across to Lausanne to <a href="https://www.epfl.ch/" target="_blank">EPFL</a> to visit <a href="https://www.f6s.com/skeletoncad" target="_blank">SkeletonCAD</a>.

It was a very different crowd – Sports Management students from <a href="http://www.aists.org/" target="_blank">AISTS</a>, about 50% of whom raised their hands when asked by another presenter (my friend and host, Thomas Kienzel from <a href="http://edddison.com/" target="_blank">edddison</a>) if they knew the difference between 2D and 3D, although I'm sure some were being shy – but it was nonetheless an enjoyable session.</p> <center> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr" align="left">Presenting <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/EPFL?src=hash">#EPFL</a> with <a href="https://twitter.com/ThomasKienzle">@ThomasKienzle</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/keanw">@keanw</a> to a group of students about <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BIM?src=hash">#BIM</a> , VR and <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/forge?src=hash">#forge</a> <a href="https://t.co/BCedMEyBF4">pic.twitter.com/BCedMEyBF4</a></p> <p align="left">— Peter Schlipf (@PeterSchlipf) <a href="https://twitter.com/PeterSchlipf/status/745976100677890050">June 23, 2016</a></p></blockquote> <p align="center"><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p> <p>&nbsp;</p></center> <p>Over the next few days I'm going to be digging deep on internal tasks, but I'll certainly be blogging about something tomorrow: if nothing else I want to reflect on the DevCon, now that it's a week in the past, to discuss key takeaways.</p>
