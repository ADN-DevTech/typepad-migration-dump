<p>A quick reminder – as I already posted <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2014/05/au2014-class-proposals-and-advance-passes.html" target="_blank">on this topic a few months ago</a> – about <a href="http://autode.sk/APtw" target="_blank">the “early bird” $600 discount that’s available now</a> – and until August 19th – for this year’s AU. It’s a great way to get first dibs on the classes of your choice, as you get to register a week before people who don’t hold advance passes (such as Autodesk employees, sniff-sniff ;-).</p>  <p>It’s already shaping up to be a hectic AU for me, again: both the classes I submitted got accepted (thanks, developer track leads!) and it turns out I’ll be participating in a couple of others, too. Stephen Preston tells me he won’t be able to make it to AU, this year. It’s the first one he’s missed in a long time, but he’s doing so for good reasons. Hence his request that I host the until-now very popular “Meet the AutoCAD API Experts” panel session. Stephen is a dab hand at hosting this panel – it really won’t be the same without his dry sense of humour – but I’ll do my best to at least partially fill the significant void he’ll leave at this year’s event.</p>  <p>The fourth (and hopefully last) speaking engagement at this year’s AU – although I have no idea which order they’ll actually be scheduled – is to co-speak at a session about <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2014/03/configuring-3-wheelers-at-the-geneva-motor-show.html" target="_blank">the car configurator Autodesk delivered to Morgan for this year’s Geneva Motor Show</a>. I wasn’t involved in the development work for the project, so I’m very happy to be co-speaking on that one (it should be a lot of fun).</p>  <p>That’s it for this week: I’m heading off to Munich tomorrow to participate in this year’s Autodesk Football Tournament (yes, it’s an internal company event, I’m sorry to say for people who have expressed an interest in joining, in the past). Teams from all over the world will be fighting it out, and some players will no doubt stay on to watch Sunday’s World Cup final, too (presumably hoping for a German win, considering the event’s location :-). I’m planning to head back on Sunday to watch the match from home, but we’ll see what happens. I’ll then be back posting again during the course of next week before I head out on vacation for 2-3 weeks, after that.</p>
