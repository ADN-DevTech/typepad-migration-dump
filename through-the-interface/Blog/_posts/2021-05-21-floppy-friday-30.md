<p style="text-align: left">In <a href="https://youtu.be/fBBBylEw-CE" rel="noopener" target="_blank">this week’s episode</a> we dust off the Atari 2600 and play a few games on cartridge.</p>
<p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2026bded2e3e6200c-pi" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Today&#39;s Atari games" border="0" height="441" src="/assets/image_780186.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="Today&#39;s Atari games" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>We kick things off with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stargate_(video_game)" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Stargate</a>, which is a sequel to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defender_(1981_video_game)" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Defender</a>, apparently, and then play <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missile_Command" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Missile Command</a> followed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon_Patrol" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Moon Patrol</a> – games we saw (or talked about) on the C64 in episodes <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2020/12/floppy-friday-6.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">#6</a> and <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2021/04/floppy-friday-26.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">#26</a> respectively. After jumping over a few lunar craters, we head back down to Earth to jump hurdles in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Games_(video_game)" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Summer Games</a> and then juggle hacky sacks and ride downhill mountain bikes in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Games" rel="noopener" target="_blank">California Games</a>.</p>

<p>During the episode I mentioned “that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_drawing_algorithm" rel="noopener" target="_blank">line drawing algorithm</a>” which was meant to refer to “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bresenham%27s_line_algorithm" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Bresenham’s line algorithm</a>”, in case you’re curious what I was talking about.</p>
<p>As I mentioned in this week’s episode, I’ve decided to aim at a round 64 for the Floppy Friday series. You may well be relieved to know that we’re nearly halfway there!</p>
