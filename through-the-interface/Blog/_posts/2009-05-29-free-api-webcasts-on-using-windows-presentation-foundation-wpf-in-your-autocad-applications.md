<p>Fenton Webb, from DevTech Americas, is presenting two sessions on using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Presentation_Foundation">WPF</a> in your AutoCAD .NET applications. These will be of particular interest to developers wanting to take their ribbon interfaces to the next level in AutoCAD 2010, but will be of relevance to anyone wanting to understand more about WPF and how it can be used within AutoCAD.</p>  <p>The first session is coming up quickly, on June 2nd (next Tuesday), but if you’re reading this soon after I’ve posted you should still have time to <a href="http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/item?id=10417086&amp;siteID=123112&amp;cname=AutoCAD: Using Windows Presentation Foundation in your Applications - Part 1, Webcast, Jun 02 2009, 200826">register</a>. The second session is scheduled for July 14th.</p>  <p>Both sessions will be recorded and available for download from <a href="http://www.adskconsulting.com/adn/cs/api_course_sched.php">our API training schedule</a> which can also be accessed via this easy-to-remember URL: <a href="http://www.autodesk.com/apitraining">http://www.autodesk.com/apitraining</a>.</p>
