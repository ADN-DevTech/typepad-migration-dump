<p>My flight out of Zurich was delayed slightly – for snow, of all things! – but the trip across to San Francisco was otherwise smooth enough. After spending a fun Saturday night and Sunday in the city – catching up with old friends – it was nice to head back up to San Rafael for the evening.</p>  <p>I spent most of the day today (it’s still Monday, here) in our San Rafael office before we hit the road south to Santa Cruz, where I’ll be attending an offsite meeting for the next few days.</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2017eea7c64ef970d-pi" target="_blank"><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 20px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="Crossing the Big Red Bridge" border="0" alt="Crossing the Big Red Bridge" src="/assets/image_665919.jpg" width="275" height="366" /></a></p>  <p>I chose to sit in the back on the way down, which was fun, if a little windy. We took the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_State_Route_1" target="_blank">Pacific Coast Highway</a>, and while I remember it as being more scenic, further down the coast, it was still pretty spectacular.</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201901b7f0114970b-pi" target="_blank"><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 20px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="Cruising down to Santa Cruz" border="0" alt="Cruising down to Santa Cruz" src="/assets/image_944450.jpg" width="394" height="296" /></a></p>
