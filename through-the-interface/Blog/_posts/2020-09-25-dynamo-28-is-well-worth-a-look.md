<p>My friend Sol posted a few weeks ago about <a href="https://dynamobim.org/dynamo-core-2-8-release/" target="_blank">the latest release of Dynamo</a> – currently available in Sandbox form – which has <a href="https://github.com/DynamoDS/Dynamo/wiki/Release-Notes" target="_blank">a number of compelling enhancements</a>.</p><p>First-up is a migration tool – developed by the talented team at Matterlab – which will take your code from IronPython 2 to CPython 3. This is <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2020/07/dynamo-27-migrating-mars-to-cpython3.html" target="_blank">something I’d tried manually a couple of months ago</a>, and frankly I’m delighted there’s now a tool available.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2026be4149bae200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="312" title="Migrating MaRS with Dynamo 2.8" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Migrating MaRS with Dynamo 2.8" src="/assets/image_138989.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>The tool is really slick! It found issues (mainly related to whitespace, admittedly) in my already translated code, and also made short work of translating a few nodes I’d missed, last time around. I will say that I’m missing a “batch mode” – or at least a mode that allows you to work through a list of nodes to change, much as <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2018/07/introducing-warnamo-a-dynamo-package-for-managing-warnings-and-errors.html" target="_blank">Warnamo does with warnings/errors</a> – but that shouldn’t be hard to write, if it hasn’t already been created and I’ve somehow missed it.</p><p>It’s great to see that print() has been enabled inside Python code – sending the results to the Dynamo console – and I’m sure it won’t be long before I end up needing everyone’s favourite (or should that be least favourite?) debugging mechanism.</p><p>Another “yeehaw” moment with the 2.8 release is around graphics performance. This baby flies!</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2026be4149abb200d-pi"><img width="500" height="312" title="Super responsive" style="margin: 30px auto; float: none; display: block;" alt="Super responsive" src="/assets/image_440906.jpg"></a></p><p>This animation was captured in a Parallels VM: an impressive improvement.</p><p>Interestingly the graphics preview performance seems significantly better when you’re zoomed way into the node view (presumably both need to be rendered, so perhaps having fewer nodes to draw on-screen brings some performance benefits). It also seems that graphics display is crisper in this release, which presumably comes from the upgrade of Helix in 2.7 (and an anti-aliasing bugfix in 2.8).</p><p>I’m really excited by Dynamo’s trajectory, these days. <a href="https://autode.sk/mars-graph" target="_blank">The MaRS graph</a> has always been a bit of a beast – as anyone who has either worked on it or checked it out will attest – but I can safely say it’s finally easy to navigate and work with inside Dynamo. Let’s see where it goes from here!</p>
