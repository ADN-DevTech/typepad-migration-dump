<p>This one did the rounds over the holiday and so I expect many of you will have missed it (unless you also happen to read <a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2013/01/create-facewall-on-slanted-mass-face.html" target="_blank">Jeremy’s blog</a>). I’m still finishing up some work that I’ll hopefully be able to unveil during the coming weeks, and I thought I’d post this in the meantime.</p>  <p>Autodesk Research has published a pretty amazing visualization of Autodesk’s organizational evolution over a period of four years, from May 2007 to June 2011. Like many nodes in the tree who remained static during that particular period, it can come as a bit of a surprise to see just how dynamic an organization such as Autodesk can be.</p>  <p>There’s obviously a human side to this that the visualization clearly doesn’t tell, where people have had change forced upon them for various reasons. But the visualization is nonetheless interesting and (dare I say) beautiful.</p>  <br /><iframe height="352" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/mkJ-Uy5dt5g" frameborder="0" width="470" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>  <br />  <br />  <p>In the YouTube comments, Justin Matejka from our Autodesk Research team described the technologies used to make this visualization as “straight Java for the data﻿ processing, GraphViz for the graph layout, and Processing to render the resulting graphs.”</p>
