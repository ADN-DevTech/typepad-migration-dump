<p>We had originally planned on leaving KwaZulu-Natal to enter into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesotho" target="_blank">Lesotho</a> on December 10th, but that morning two things happened: we awoke to find it raining heavily, but – more importantly – one of the kids had some gastric problems. We ended up extending our stay in the Tower of Pizza for an additional day, which we spent in front of a roaring fire, making handmade Christmas ornaments and watching seasonal movies. It was really the first serious feeling of Christmas we’ve had, this year… it was very welcome, too.</p><p>Anyway, back on the road the following day, we headed to Lesotho. We debated whether to take the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sani_Pass" target="_blank">Sani Pass</a> to enter the country – it’s meant to be absolutely stunning – but given the recent rain and our uncertainty about the road conditions, we decided to power on round to a more predictable entry into the country.</p><p>We drove first past the Sterkfonteindam, and then climbed up into the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Gate_Highlands_National_Park" target="_blank">Golden Gate Highlands National Park</a>, where we had a very interesting mix of weather conditions.</p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201bb09e19a5c970d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Sterkfonteindam" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Sterkfonteindam" src="/assets/image_307462.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b7c93e8c7b970b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="The view from the climb into Golden Gate Highlands National Park" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="The view from the climb into Golden Gate Highlands National Park" src="/assets/image_942159.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b8d2c8df9a970c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="The view from the road" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="The view from the road" src="/assets/image_166875.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b8d2c8df9e970c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Monkeys crossing" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Monkeys crossing" src="/assets/image_264038.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b8d2c8dfa2970c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="The sun came out" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="The sun came out" src="/assets/image_332058.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201bb09e19a66970d-pi" target="_blank"><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201bb09e19a66970d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Then the weather came back in" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Then the weather came back in" src="/assets/image_855027.jpg" border="0"></a></a></p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b7c93e8c88970b-pi" target="_blank"><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b7c93e8c88970b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Moody sky" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Moody sky" src="/assets/image_646445.jpg" border="0"></a></a></p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b8d2c8dfac970c-pi" target="_blank"><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b8d2c8dfac970c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="But with the odd bit of sun shining through" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="But with the odd bit of sun shining through" src="/assets/image_951826.jpg" border="0"></a></a></p><p><p>We’d read horror stories about the wait at the borderpoint near the capital, Maseru, so decided to cross at Ficksburg Bridge, instead. This proved to be a great decision.</p><p>Entering Lesotho was straightforward: we had to queue for maybe 20 minutes to get an exit stamp from South Africa – with a fairly large crowd of Lesotho citizens, who had presumably entered South Africa for the day – but had no queue at all to enter into Lesotho on the other side of the bridge. Entering the country was a bit of a shock for the kids, though: it was immediately much more “African” than where we’d been so far, in terms of the amount of noise, the traffic and the goings on in the street. This reduced as we gained distance from the border – and increased temporarily as we drove through Maseru – but changed completely as we hit the countryside.</p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b7c93e8c94970b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Entering into Lesotho" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Entering into Lesotho" src="/assets/image_793967.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b7c93e8c9f970b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Always plenty to see" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Always plenty to see" src="/assets/image_968845.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b8d2c8dfb2970c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Leaving Maseru" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Leaving Maseru" src="/assets/image_639812.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Lesotho is a magical place… it’s a mountain kingdom surrounded – and completely landlocked – by South Africa. It doesn’t have the same economic power, of course, but then neither did it suffer through apartheid... the country just feels very different from its neighbour. Aside from widespread poverty, the major problem in Lesotho is HIV/AIDS: it has the <a href="https://www.avert.org/professionals/hiv-around-world/sub-saharan-africa/lesotho" target="_blank">second highest HIV prevalence of any country, just behind Swaziland</a>. Apparently as many as 53% percent of adults are undergoing antiretroviral treatment (although the adults prevalence rate is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV/AIDS_in_Lesotho" target="_blank">fairly stable at the – still-shocking – 25% mark</a>).</p><p>Our chosen destination for this leg of the trip was Malealea… a truly beautiful part of the world.</p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b7c93e8ca5970b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Arriving in Malealea" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Arriving in Malealea" src="/assets/image_766353.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b8d2c8e119970c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="89" title="The valley where the Malealea Lodge sits" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="The valley where the Malealea Lodge sits" src="/assets/image_320784.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>We’d looked at various options in guidebooks and on the web, and had settled on the Malealea Lodge.<a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201bb09e19bdb970d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Malealea Lodge" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Malealea Lodge" src="/assets/image_76920.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>We hadn’t booked in advance, as we were still a week before the school holidays start in South Africa, and figured that in the worst case we’d find space there to camp. It turned out that they had plenty of availability – at least until the following week – and so we chose to book for 3 nights in a couple of standard rooms (we considered their lovely rondavels, but would have had to stay in two separate ones… we prefered being in connected two rooms, instead).</p><p>After checking in, we listened to a local choir performing. This choir wasn’t paid by the Lodge, but comes in a few times a week to sing for its residents. People in rural Lesotho are often very poor and so value greatly the tips they receive from tourists.</p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b7c93e8ca9970b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="A local choir performs" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="A local choir performs" src="/assets/image_808187.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>On our first full day in Malealea we decided to go exploring on our own. We followed the instructions provided in the rooms, to walk down to a nearby waterfall.</p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201bb09e19abd970d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="The walk down to the waterfall" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="The walk down to the waterfall" src="/assets/image_985763.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201bb09e19be0970d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="136" title="The view across the valley" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="The view across the valley" src="/assets/image_10603.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201bb09e19ac1970d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Down through an empty riverbed" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Down through an empty riverbed" src="/assets/image_281791.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201bb09e19ac5970d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Lots of fun" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Lots of fun" src="/assets/image_366397.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b7c93e8d05970b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="375" height="500" title="Patches of water" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Patches of water" src="/assets/image_688262.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201bb09e19ad0970d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Along the side of the riverbed" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Along the side of the riverbed" src="/assets/image_495498.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b7c93e8d0a970b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Grazing horses" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Grazing horses" src="/assets/image_449554.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>We stopped to eat, and had some local children come along and ask for the usual combination of money and sweets.

We were accompanied by two guides on horseback, and ended up hiring a couple of men from the village to lead the ponies for the two younger kids. This was really helpful for the steeper sections of trail.</p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201bb09e19b52970d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Riding towards the rock paintings" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Riding towards the rock paintings" src="/assets/image_287002.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b7c93e8d96970b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Down towards the valley" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Down towards the valley" src="/assets/image_737565.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b8d2c8e09b970c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Zephyr having a blast" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Zephyr having a blast" src="/assets/image_225546.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b8d2c8e09f970c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="375" height="500" title="The ponies occasional decided to stop for a bite" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="The ponies occasional decided to stop for a bite" src="/assets/image_689222.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Lesotho is full of shepherds tending their various flocks.</p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b7c93e8da6970b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="A heard of sheep with its shepherd" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="A heard of sheep with its shepherd" src="/assets/image_26206.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b8d2c8e0a6970c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Riding through a village" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Riding through a village" src="/assets/image_346555.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Arriving at the top of the area with the paintings, we were greeted by a crowd of children.
