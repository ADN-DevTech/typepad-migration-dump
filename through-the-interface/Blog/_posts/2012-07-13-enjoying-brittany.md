<p>This year’s Autodesk football tournament was excellent – congratulations to the IPG 1 team, this year’s well-deserving winners! (I’ve included a picture from their 2-1 quarter-final victory over us, below.) Towards the end of our last game of the day (thankfully) I managed to sustain a thigh injury after a collision with <a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/autocad/fenton-webb.html" target="_blank">Fenton</a> (he was playing for the GS-ISM team, while I was playing for Swiss 2). This made walking around pretty painful for the next few days, and certainly made the drive up to Brittany (with an overnight stay at <a href="http://www.lamaisondethomas.fr/" target="_blank">a fantastic guest-house</a> in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blois" target="_blank">Blois</a> to break up the trip) less comfortable that it might have been. But that’s how it goes.</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2016768760a1b970b-pi" target="_blank"><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; margin: 20px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="IPG 1 vs. Swiss 2" border="0" alt="IPG 1 vs. Swiss 2" src="/assets/image_981876.jpg" width="474" height="317" /></a></p>  <p>We arrived in Brittany on Monday evening, where we’re staying with old friends of ours (<a href="http://around-the-corner.typepad.com/adn/cyrille-fauvel.html" target="_blank">Cyrille</a> and his family). It was great to see them all, and we’ve since been enjoying all this most Western-most point of France has to offer.</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20176166ae4cd970c-pi" target="_blank"><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; margin: 20px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="La Maison de Niou on the island of Ouessant" border="0" alt="La Maison de Niou on the island of Ouessant" src="/assets/image_149607.jpg" width="475" height="317" /></a></p>  <p>While enjoying the Fauvels’ warm hospitality, we’ve so far visited the beach at les Blancs Sablons (a <a href="http://www.wannasurf.com/spot/Europe/France/Brittany_North/Blancs_Sablons/" target="_blank">popular surfing spot</a>), eaten crêpes at <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Creperie-la-Cormorandi%C3%A8re/231950770181470" target="_blank">the Cormorandière</a> in Loc-Maria-Plouzané, cycled around the island of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ushant" target="_blank">Ouessant</a> and spent several hours in Brest’s very impressive aquarium, <a href="http://www.oceanopolis.com/" target="_blank">Oceanopolis</a>.</p>  <p>“<a href="http://www.lestonnerresdebrest2012.fr/en" target="_blank">Les Tonnerres de Brest 2012</a>” starts today, which means we’ll hopefully get to enjoy the view of some traditional sailing ships (i.e. “pirate ships” for my kids :-). Should be a lot of fun!</p>
