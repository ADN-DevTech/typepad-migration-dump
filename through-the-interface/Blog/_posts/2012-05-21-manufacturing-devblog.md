<p>Some time ago I mentioned <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2012/04/announcing-devblogs-from-adn.html" target="_blank">the launch of ADN's DevBlogs</a>, and followed up, last week, with the announcement that <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2012/05/aec-devblog-a-month-to-go-until-devcamps.html" target="_blank">the AEC version had launched</a>.</p>  <p>Now that we have DevBlogs covering <a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/autocad" target="_blank">AutoCAD</a>, <a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/infrastructure" target="_blank">Infrastructure Modeling</a> and <a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/aec" target="_blank">our AEC products</a>, it’s only natural that we launch <a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/manufacturing/" target="_blank">a Manufacturing DevBlog</a>.</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2016305b28076970d-pi" target="_blank"><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 20px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="Manufacturing DevBlog" border="0" alt="Manufacturing DevBlog" src="/assets/image_670880.jpg" width="394" height="82" /></a></p>  <p>Brian <a href="http://modthemachine.typepad.com/my_weblog/2012/05/adn-manufacturing-devblog.html" target="_blank">has mentioned it, over on his blog</a>, too. Those of you working with Inventor, in particular, should be sure to bookmark <a href="http://blogs.autodesk.com/modthemachine" target="_blank">Brian &amp; Wayne’s Mod the Machine blog</a> as well as the Manufacturing DevBlog (after a period of relatively low activity, things have definitely picked up over at MtM).</p>  <p>It’s great to see these blogs launched, and I know they’ll be a great resource for developers. I’m already finding that the availability of AutoCAD-related developer content on another Autodesk blog is freeing me up to tackle quite different topics (which are more aligned with my new role but also a little more forward-looking).</p>  <p>If you do have topics related to our products that you’d like to see addressed, be sure to <a href="mailto:kean.walmsley@autodesk.com" target="_blank">keep letting me know</a>. I can very easily pass them on to the ADN team, should it make more sense for someone in that team to tackle them.</p>
