<p>While at the time of writing I’m not yet on the <a href="https://events.autodesk.com/flow/autodesk/devcon25emea/mainevent/page/speakers">official speaker list</a>, I’m happy to say that I will be presenting a session at the <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2025/01/register-today-for-the-autodesk-devcon-2025-in-amsterdam.html">Autodesk DevCon</a> that’s being held in Amsterdam from May 20th-21st, 2025. I’ll also be attending the <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2025/02/hackathons-in-zurich-and-soon-amsterdam.html">Dynamo Hackathon on May 19th</a> as a warm-up.</p>

<p>My session is entitled “<em>Supercharge your browser-based APS applications with WebAssembly</em>” and will explore how you can take C++ libraries and build them into WebAssembly modules to bring impressive capabilities to your browser-based Autodesk Platform Services applications.</p>
<p>Over the last few years I’ve spent quite a bit of time using Emscripten to take advanced C++ developed by Autodesk Research - such as VASA and SyDEVS - and integrate them into applications based on the APS Viewer, Tandem or Forma. It’s an important - and valuable - mechanism, and I’m looking forward to sharing what I’ve learned about what’s involved.</p>
<p>Here’s a teaser image of a prototype I’ve been working on that makes heavy use of WASM inside Forma. I’ll show more of this during the class.</p>
