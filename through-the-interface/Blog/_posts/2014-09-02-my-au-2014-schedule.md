For those of you who are curious about the classes I’m delivering/hosting/attending at this year’s event, here they are. I’ll break things down day-by-day, in case you’re interested in finding an opportunity to meet up but can’t attend one of my sessions.</p>  <p><strong>Monday (Dec 1st)</strong></p>  <p>I’ll be attending the <a href="http://au.autodesk.com/plan/pre-conference/adn-conference-devdays" target="_blank">ADN DevDay</a>, <a href="https://events.au.autodesk.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=7064" target="_blank">all</a> <a href="https://events.au.autodesk.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=7066" target="_blank">day</a>. Always lots of great information to absorb there, of course (jetlag permitting ;-).</p>  <p><strong>Tuesday (Dec 2nd)</strong></p>  <p>I’ll be hanging out at the <a href="https://events.au.autodesk.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=7076" target="_blank">ADN DevHack</a> for most of the afternoon, although I will be heading across to host the ever-popular <a href="https://events.au.autodesk.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=5147" target="_blank">Meet the AutoCAD API Experts</a> panel session (yes, Stephen Preston asked me to stand in for him, this year) from 3-4pm. I’m also planning to attend my teammate Albert Szilvasy’s <a href="https://events.au.autodesk.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=5577" target="_blank">AutoCAD Core Engine via HTTP</a> session at 5-6pm: I’ve seen most of Albert’s presentation delivered at <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2014/06/toronto.html" target="_blank">an internal conference</a>, but I’m interested in hearing more about recent progress that has been made as well as the audience’s thoughts on how this service might be used in practice.</p>  <p><strong>Wednesday (Dec 3rd)</strong></p>  <p>This is my busiest day, class-wise. I’ll be presenting a session entitled <a href="https://events.au.autodesk.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=5009" target="_blank">Connecting AutoCAD to the Web with HTML5 and JavaScript</a> from 10-11:30am, and then another session on <a href="https://events.au.autodesk.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=5013" target="_blank">Using SensorTag as a Low-Cost Sensor Array for AutoCAD</a> from 3-4pm. By which point I’ll be ready for a beer or three at <a href="https://events.au.autodesk.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=7798" target="_blank">the AUGI reception</a>, no doubt.</p>  <p><strong>Thursday (Dec 4th)</strong></p>  <p>On the last day of the conference I’ll be co-presenting a session on <a href="https://events.au.autodesk.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=7322">Configuring Morgan 3 Wheelers at the Geneva Motor Show using Autodesk VRED</a> at 1-2pm with my colleague Jason Walters (he was on the team who developed the configurator we’ll be showing). It should be a really fun way to finish up the conference! Well, that and <a href="https://events.au.autodesk.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=7408" target="_blank">the closing party</a>, of course.</p>  <p>A usual I’m very much looking forward to this year’s AU. It’s always a great opportunity to meet new people, catch up with old friends and learn more about how customers and developers are using Autodesk technology to do important – and often incredible – things. If you’re interested in talking about your use of Autodesk technology – maybe you’re having challenges that future posts on this blog might be able to help with, for instance – then please <a href="mailto:kean.walmsley@autodesk.com" target="_blank">let me know</a>. I’m sure we can find some time to sit down and chat.</p>  <p>To close, here’s my personal tag-line for the conference:</p>  <blockquote>   <p><em><font size="3">“ExhAUsting yet invigAUrating, come to AU!”</font></em></p> </blockquote>  <p>(And <em>that’s</em> why you shouldn’t let technical people do marketing. ;-)</p>
