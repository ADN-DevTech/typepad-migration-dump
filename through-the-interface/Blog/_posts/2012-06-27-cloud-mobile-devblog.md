<p>To complement the DevBlogs for <a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/autocad" target="_blank">AutoCAD</a>, <a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/infrastructure" target="_blank">Infrastructure Modeling</a>, <a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/aec" target="_blank">AEC</a> and <a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/manufacturing/" target="_blank">Manufacturing</a> (and in case you missed them, here are <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2012/04/announcing-devblogs-from-adn.html" target="_blank">their</a> <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2012/05/aec-devblog-a-month-to-go-until-devcamps.html" target="_blank">respective</a> <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2012/05/manufacturing-devblog.html" target="_blank">announcements</a>), the ADN team has now launched <a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/cloud_and_mobile/" target="_blank">a DevBlog focused on Cloud &amp; Mobile development</a>.</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2017742c29129970d-pi" target="_blank"><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; margin: 20px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="Cloud and Mobile DevBlog" border="0" alt="Cloud and Mobile DevBlog" src="/assets/image_173788.jpg" width="394" height="82" /></a></p>  <p>You might consider this another “horizontal” blog, in the sense that over time it will prove to be a valuable resource for people using our products (and, I suspect, many people who don’t) in all the industries we serve.</p>  <p>I’ll drop a note to Gopi, to suggest he adds a link to <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2012/06/cloud-mobile-series-summary.html" target="_blank">my own cloud &amp; mobile series</a>, for future reference.</p>  <p>It seems like a good time to provide a bit of background on these DevBlogs and the motivation behind them…</p>  <p>It’s clear our ADN team is focusing more of its resources on providing public information and assistance. The trend started several years ago, during the time I was part of that team: between our developer blogs, our <a href="http://labs.autodesk.com/utilities/ADN_plugins" target="_blank">Plugins of the Month</a>, the <a href="http://autodesk.com/myfirstplugin" target="_blank">My First Plugin material</a> and a gradual increase in our presence on the API discussion groups.</p>  <p>All this has been part of a broader strategy to do more for customers who don’t necessarily see the benefit of paying an annual fee to be part of the ADN program.</p>  <p>One further piece of this strategy is going to be unveiled during the coming weeks (we’re just working on some back-end infrastructure before the public launch). Without giving too much away, I will say that I expect many of this blog’s readers to find it pretty interesting. Watch this space! :-) </p>  <p><strong><em>Update:</em></strong></p>  <p>For those of you interested in an aggregated feed of the various developer-oriented Autodesk blogs, I went ahead and updated <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/autodeskdeveloper/blogs" target="_blank">the Yahoo! Pipe</a> I originally created <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2009/02/creating-your-own-custom-rss-feeds-with-yahoo-pipes.html" target="_blank">some time ago</a> to include the various ADN DevBlogs. As I know AlexF will be pinging me for it, anyway, as soon as he sees this post. ;-)</p>
