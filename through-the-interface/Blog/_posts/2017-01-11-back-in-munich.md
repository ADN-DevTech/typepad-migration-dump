<p>I’m once again across in the fine city of Munich. I flew again from Bern’s local airport, this time with a couple of colleagues from other parts of Autodesk. Here’s a quick photo I took from the window as the sun was setting over the&nbsp; Alps. It was nice to be above the fog for a while!</p> <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b7c8c6b026970b-pi" target="_blank"><img title="Flying to Munich" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 30px auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="Flying to Munich" src="/assets/image_262731.jpg" width="520" height="301"></a></p> <p>We’re attending an internal training called ABLE – the Autodesk Business Leadership Experience – which educates employees about competitive strategy and how it is used by – and impacts – companies such as Autodesk.&nbsp; Here’s Jon Pittman, our VP of Corporate Strategy, talking about the early competitive landscape in the CAD industry.</p> <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b7c8c6b03c970b-pi" target="_blank"><img title="Jon talking about the CAD industry" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 30px auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="Jon talking about the CAD industry" src="/assets/image_595641.jpg" width="520" height="301"></a></p> <p>I’ve attended a couple of lighter versions of the training, over the years: one-day simulations where you role-play running the business as part of a team competing with a number of others (in this training there are 5 teams of 6-7 players). This one goes much further, however: it’s four long days – including a couple of working dinners – spent working through a much deeper/broader business simulation where your team invests/divests according to their decided strategy over a multi-year simulation period.</p> <p>These games are a lot of fun but also very instructive: they give a very good sense of how decisions – and, importantly, trade-offs – get made when companies are in competitive situations. I especially like the fact each team has a good mix of people from different parts of Autodesk: I’m learning a lot about the challenges faced by colleagues in other departments.</p> <p>We’re just about to get the results of the first year of the simuation: I’ll be heading home after the third year wraps up on Friday afternoon. It’ll be interesting to see how it all turns out.</p>
