<p>At the beginning of this week I headed back across to the fine city of Zürich for a couple of days. My first port of call on Monday morning was to the NEST building on <a href="https://www.empa.ch/" target="_blank">Empa</a>’s Dübendorf campus. (I’ve talked <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2018/05/nest-in-zurich.html" target="_blank">about</a> <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2018/09/robarch-2018.html" target="_blank">NEST</a> <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2019/02/back-at-nest.html" target="_blank">many</a> <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2019/04/showcasing-nest-at-au-london-2019.html" target="_blank">times</a> in the past, as we have an ongoing project to host its digital twin using <a href="http://dasher360.com" target="_blank">Dasher 360</a>.)</p><p>Arriving at the building it was exciting to see the building covered with scaffolding, as the work has started to build the <a href="https://www.empa.ch/web/nest/hilo" target="_blank">HiLo</a> roof.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4ca2941200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="375" height="500" title="First view of HiLo" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="First view of HiLo" src="/assets/image_168232.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Here’s the breakdown of NEST’s units by floor. HiLo is accessible via the 3rd floor.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a47c4c71200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="The NEST units" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="The NEST units" src="/assets/image_999471.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>I took a quick picture looking outside from the 3rd floor onto the initial formwork for the roof. There’s more to come, of course.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4a58c25200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="345" title="HiLo formwork" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="HiLo formwork" src="/assets/image_822879.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p><p>First on the day’s agenda was a meeting with the stakeholders involved in the NEST project, including Matthias Wasem and Antonio Cocca from BIM Facility AG, who helped update the Revit model of the building to include many of its sensors.</p><p>I gave a quick demo of a new version of Dasher 360 – with some interesting new realtime capabilities – which will be used for NEST’s digital twin. You’ll be able to access this new version – with the NEST model inside it – sometime during the next week or two. Watch this space!</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4ca2950200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Reviewing NEST in the new Dasher" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Reviewing NEST in the new Dasher" src="/assets/image_660259.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>After the demo, the group were taken on a tour of NEST by Reto Largo, its CEO. This was the first time my manager, Azam Khan, had seen the building. We started at the <a href="https://www.empa.ch/web/s604/umar_award" target="_blank">award-winning</a> <a href="https://www.empa.ch/web/nest/urban-mining" target="_blank">Urban Mining &amp; Recycling</a> unit, which has been built using a maximum of recycled (and recyclable) materials.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4ca2954200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Urban mining" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Urban mining" src="/assets/image_722413.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a47c4c75200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Urban mining" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Urban mining" src="/assets/image_797313.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>We visited the unit with the photovoltaic balcony facade, intended to be net positive in terms of energy generation.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a47c4c79200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="375" height="500" title="Solar facade" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Solar facade" src="/assets/image_423858.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>We saw where this energy was stored in the basement’s supercapacitors.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a47c4c7b200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Big batteries" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Big batteries" src="/assets/image_639287.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Perhaps bizarrely, one of my favourite parts of the tour is where we see the water treatment: NEST has special toilets allowing the early separation of yellow, gray and black water.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4ca2964200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Water processing at NEST" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Water processing at NEST" src="/assets/image_186943.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>The yellow water (yes, the urine) is used to create fertilizer.</p><p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4ca296c200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="One of my favourite parts of NEST" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="One of my favourite parts of NEST" src="/assets/image_885911.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Azam had come across from Toronto primarily to present at the <a href="http://www.humarch.ethz.ch/" target="_blank">humARCH</a> summer school organised by ETH Zurich and EPF Lausanne, which was (conveniently for us) also being held at NEST.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a47c4c83200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="375" height="500" title="humArch poster in NEST" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="humArch poster in NEST" src="/assets/image_267257.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>On Tuesday morning Azam kicked the day off with a keynote talking about the work his team has done in this area, with a particular focus on sustainability (one of Azam’s passions).</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4ca2970200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Azam at humARCH" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Azam at humARCH" src="/assets/image_272164.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>After this was over, Azam and I met with <a href="http://www.dfab.ch/twofolio/russell-loveridge/" target="_blank">Russell Loveridge from the NCCR Digital Fabrication</a>. Russell started by giving us a tour of the DFAB House, another NEST unit.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4ca2978200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="375" height="500" title="Russell and Azam in the DFAB House" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Russell and Azam in the DFAB House" src="/assets/image_759387.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a47c4c8b200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="The DFAB House" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="The DFAB House" src="/assets/image_971318.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>It was a real treat to hear Russell – who has been heavily involved in the project since its inception – provide us with additional context.<a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a47c50cf200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="375" height="500" title="Entering the upper part of the DFAB House" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Entering the upper part of the DFAB House" src="/assets/image_181986.jpg" border="0"></a><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4ca2e31200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="375" height="500" title="Azam in the DFAB House" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Azam in the DFAB House" src="/assets/image_320919.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>We then headed across to the <a href="https://ethz.ch/en" target="_blank">ETH Zurich</a>’s <a href="https://ethz.ch/en/campus/access/hoenggerberg.html" target="_blank">Hönggerberg campus</a>, where Russell showed us the <a href="https://ita.arch.ethz.ch/" target="_blank">Institute for Technology in Architecture</a>’s <a href="https://ita.arch.ethz.ch/archteclab.html" target="_blank">Arch_Tec_Lab building</a>.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4ca297c200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Back at ITA" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Back at ITA" src="/assets/image_711425.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>There were some impressive projects on display in the lab, many of which made use of techniques such as 3D printing, unsurprisingly.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4ca2e36200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Cool projects" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Cool projects" src="/assets/image_373957.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4a590a1200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Crazy complexity" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Crazy complexity" src="/assets/image_740585.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a47c4c8f200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Some crazy prints" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Some crazy prints" src="/assets/image_180305.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>The ITA’s more hands-on area – which <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2018/09/robarch-2018.html" target="_blank">I’d last visited at Rob|Arch</a>, last year – is always very interesting to visit, too.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a47c4c97200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="The project area at ITA" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="The project area at ITA" src="/assets/image_89911.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>ETH is doing some very interesting work with concrete printing. As the printed material’s strength is often only a third of that of poured concrete, they’re also exploring ways to combine the two techniques.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4ca2981200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="375" height="500" title="Concrete printing" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Concrete printing" src="/assets/image_356930.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Robots are being used for assembly as well as for printing, of course.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4ca2987200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Robots and wood" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Robots and wood" src="/assets/image_595009.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Another project explored the use of robotic welding to combine existing components, rather than building them up completely from scratch. I can well imagine this being extended to include generative design, in due course.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a47c4c9b200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="375" height="500" title="Welded joints" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Welded joints" src="/assets/image_776003.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>It was a great couple of days: I’m really happy with the progress we’re making around our engagement with NEST, and it’s also a privilege to see more of the goings-on at ETH. Many thanks to all those involved in making this trip happen, particularly Reto, Russell and Matthias, as well as Philipp Mueller, who came across from Munich to be with us.</p></p></p>
