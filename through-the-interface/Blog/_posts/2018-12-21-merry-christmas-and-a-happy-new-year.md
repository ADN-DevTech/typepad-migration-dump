<p>Today is our last day of work for this calendar year. I spent it in our Gumligen office – Autodesk’s main office now in Switzerland – where we had a workshop in the morning followed by a raclette for lunch. Many thanks to all of those involved in organising and preparing the meal: it was a really nice moment.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad382ee03200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Christmas raclette in the Gumligen office" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Christmas raclette in the Gumligen office" src="/assets/image_578731.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>This afternoon I built <a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/files/Trees.dyn" target="_blank">a quick and dirty Dynamo script that creates Christmas trees</a>…</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad382ee09200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="312" title="Dynamo script to build a Xmas tree" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Dynamo script to build a Xmas tree" src="/assets/image_137923.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>… and then ran it through Project Refinery to generatively design some Christmas trees.

It’s been a year of significant change for many of us, here at Autodesk, and I’m personally very much looking forward to taking a break with my family, turning the page and kicking off 2019.</p><p>May all of you have a wonderful, relaxing break – if you’re lucky enough to be taking one – and I look forward to seeing you back here in the new year. Happy Holidays!</p>
