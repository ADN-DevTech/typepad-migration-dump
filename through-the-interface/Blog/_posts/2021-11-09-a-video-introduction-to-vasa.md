<p>Rhys Goldstein, the researcher behind our 2D and 3D Space Analysis toolkits, has recorded <a href="https://youtu.be/wE4gk0FYWDw" target="_blank">a great video introduction to VASA</a> (an acronym for <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2021/09/introducing-vasa-for-voxel-based-architectural-space-analysis.html" target="_blank">Voxel-based Architectural Space Analysis</a>).</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2026bdefeca92200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="279" title="Rhys talking about VASA" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Rhys talking about VASA" src="/assets/image_545726.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>It steps through how to install the VASA package inside Dynamo and then create a simple voxelisation of Dynamo geometry. Rhys also shows how to load and run the samples provided with the package, and takes some time to step through – and then dissect – the main overview sample. Here it is:</p><p align="center"><br></p><p align="center"><iframe width="500" height="283" title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wE4gk0FYWDw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"></iframe></p><p align="center"><br></p><p>If you don’t have time to spend 23 minutes watching a video, it should be quite watchable at higher playback speeds, especially given the high quality captions that Rhys has taken the time to include. If you’re brave you can even go beyond the standard 2X speed-up: when decent captions are available I find I can go up above the 3X mark using a tool such as this <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/video-speed-controller/nffaoalbilbmmfgbnbgppjihopabppdk" target="_blank">Video Speed Controller Chrome Extension</a>. (I love this tool: it saves me so much time and even works with many video players that don’t expose speed controls.)</p><p>This is the first in a series of videos where Rhys will step through the various VASA samples. From my side I’ve been having some fun using VASA with FormIt, which I’ll talk about in a series of blog posts starting tomorrow. </p>
