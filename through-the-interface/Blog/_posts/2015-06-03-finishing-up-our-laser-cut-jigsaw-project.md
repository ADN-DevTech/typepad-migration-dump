<p>I spent some time back down at <a href="http://fablab-neuch.ch" target="_blank">our local Fab Lab</a>, today, finishing the laser cutting work for the jigsaw project <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2015/04/extracting-help-ids-for-autocads-ui-finder.html" target="_blank">I</a> <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2015/04/creating-jigsaw-puzzles-inside-autocad-using-net.html" target="_blank">mentioned</a> <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2015/04/puzzling-over-laser-cutters.html" target="_blank">previously</a>. Since I last mentioned it, we managed to procure some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poly%28methyl_methacrylate%29" target="_blank">Plexiglas</a> – in our case it was <a href="http://perspex.com" target="_blank">Perspex</a>, in fact – and cut various sections of the puzzle, with each piece including an engraved word and a hole to make it into a key-chain souvenir. Today’s job needed the additional size of the Fab Lab’s laser cutter – theirs can cut sheets with 40cm on a side, whereas ours can only manage 30cm – as we were cutting a two-part plate (laminated from two pieces of Plexiglas) to contain the completed puzzle.</p>  <p>As we were combining work performed on two different cutters – with different software and drivers – we started by cutting a cardboard prototype, to make sure the size worked. This allowed us to adjust the scale accordingly.</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b8d1217101970c-pi" target="_blank"><img title="The cardboard prototype with words redacted" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 20px auto; border-left: 0px; display: block; padding-right: 0px" border="0" alt="The cardboard prototype with words redacted" src="/assets/image_988656.jpg" width="394" height="224" /></a></p>  <p>I’ve redacted the words on the plate – and on the puzzle itself – as these are the results of internal strategy sessions and its not my place to air another team’s dirty laundry. And as the team-building event hasn’t happened yet, I’d hate to give my colleagues clues as to how the pieces fit together. :-)</p>  <p>Next we needed to make sure the standard speed and power settings for 3mm Plexiglas worked well with our own sheets. We used a junk sheet for that. Then we were ready to create the plate itself, which we cut from two separate sheets and bonded with glue.</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201bb083c1c79970d-pi" target="_blank"><img title="The finished plate with the message redacted" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 20px auto; border-left: 0px; display: block; padding-right: 0px" border="0" alt="The finished plate with the message redacted" src="/assets/image_617887.jpg" width="394" height="224" /></a></p>  <p>The engraving on the Plexiglas worked very well (it surprised me, in fact). And the finished puzzle looks really nice inside its plate.</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201bb083c1c7d970d-pi" target="_blank"><img title="With the jigsaw in it and the words redacted" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 20px auto; border-left: 0px; display: block; padding-right: 0px" border="0" alt="With the jigsaw in it and the words redacted" src="/assets/image_38475.jpg" width="394" height="224" /></a></p>  <p>Well done to my fellow Autodeskers, Sylvain and Nate: it was fun collaborating with you both and the results are great.</p>  <p>I’m still working on taking the code we used to generate the puzzle and packaging it as a custom activity to be run on AutoCAD I/O. I’ve created the app package (containing an early version of the code… there’s still work needed to support engraving) and have uploaded it to the service – I’ll be sharing how I did that in due course – but I still need to write the code to call it from <a href="http://jigsawify.com" target="_blank">the web-site I’ve put together</a>. Yes, it even has its own domain name!</p>
