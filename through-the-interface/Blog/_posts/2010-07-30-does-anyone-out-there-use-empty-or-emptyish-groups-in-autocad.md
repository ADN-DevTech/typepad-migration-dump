<p>AutoCAD’s Product Design team are considering the possibility of automatically removing unnamed groups that are either empty or only contain a single item. The question, though, is whether anyone out there is for some reason relying on the existence of such groups, and consequently whether we would therefore be risking breaking applications or customizations should we choose to auto-purge them.</p>  <p>So… do you have an application that uses unnamed groups with 0 or 1 items? I don’t have a firm idea of why anyone would do this, but then I’m often surprised by the innovative ways people find to implement custom functionality in AutoCAD. :-)</p>  <p>Please post a comment or <a href="mailto:kean.walmsley@autodesk.com">send me an email</a>.</p>  <p><strong><em>Update</em></strong></p>  <p>It turns out the plan is only to auto-purge *unnamed* groups containing 0 or 1 items (this was missing from my original post, I have now adjusted the language, above).</p>
