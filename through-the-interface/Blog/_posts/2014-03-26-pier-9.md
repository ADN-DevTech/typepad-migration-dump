<p>This is without a doubt the coolest office Autodesk has anywhere in the world. <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Pier+9/@37.7999155,-122.3980958,17z" target="_blank">Pier 9</a>, on San Francisco’s waterfront, houses the Autodesk Consumer Group, including the <a href="https://www.tinkercad.com" target="_blank">Tinkercad</a> and <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Overview-Access-to-Autodesk-Pier-9-Workshop/" target="_blank">Instructables</a> teams, as well as members of <a href="http://research.autodesk.com" target="_blank">Autodesk Research</a> and visiting <a href="http://www.instructables.com/group/air" target="_blank">artists-in-residence</a>. And it has the most phenomenal workshops, kitted out with cutting-edge technology.</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201a3fcdefeec970b-pi" target="_blank"><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 20px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="The entrance" border="0" alt="The entrance" src="/assets/image_183141.jpg" width="408" height="280" /></a></p>  <p>I’d been hoping to visit for some time but this was really my first real opportunity since <a href="http://inthefold.autodesk.com/in_the_fold/2013/09/autodesk-opens-new-workshop-for-advanced-manufacturing-making-in-port-of-san-francisco.html" target="_blank">its official opening back in September</a>. I wandered across from our 1 Market office (which is also pretty cool, but relatively lacking in toys ;-) with Gaurav Sachdeva, a colleague visiting from Singapore. Gaurav also happens to be a keen photographer, so I took advantage of his presence to get a few snaps using something better than my mobile phone. The images in this post were all taken by Gaurav.</p>  <p>On arrival we were lucky enough to bump into <a href="http://blog.123dapp.com/author/gmelantoni" target="_blank">Guillermo Melantoni</a>, the Tinkercad Product Manager, who very kindly offered to give us a tour (access is restricted to people who’ve gone through training on the equipment available there: it’s just too dangerous to have tourists such as myself wandering around unsupervised).</p>  <p>Before we entered the workshop we were able to see some cool creations, such as <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/3D-Printed-Record" target="_blank">3D printed vinyl</a>…</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201a5118ea6b2970c-pi" target="_blank"><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 20px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="3D printed vinyl" border="0" alt="3D printed vinyl" src="/assets/image_912446.jpg" width="408" height="280" /></a></p>  <p>… and <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Arduino-Controlled-Robotic-Drum" target="_blank">an Arduino-controlled drum kit</a>:</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201a73d99d8e6970d-pi" target="_blank"><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 20px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="Arduino-controlled drum kit" border="0" alt="Arduino-controlled drum kit" src="/assets/image_751489.jpg" width="408" height="280" /></a></p>      <p>We had to don protective specs to enter the workshop area, of course.</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201a5118ea6bd970c-pi" target="_blank"><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 20px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="Ready to enter the workshop" border="0" alt="Ready to enter the workshop" src="/assets/image_374154.jpg" width="408" height="280" /></a></p>  <p>I can well imagine this is the kind of facility that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Man" target="_blank">Tony Stark</a> would have at his disposal.</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201a3fcdeff07970b-pi" target="_blank"><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 20px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="Iron Man" border="0" alt="Iron Man" src="/assets/image_733813.jpg" width="408" height="280" /></a></p>  <p>The equipment available was truly impressive: assuming you’ve followed the training you can use a waterjet cutter or an 11-axis CNC machine.</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201a5118ea6ca970c-pi" target="_blank"><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 20px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="Amazing what you can do with pressurised water" border="0" alt="Amazing what you can do with pressurised water" src="/assets/image_411991.jpg" width="408" height="280" /></a></p>  <p>A separate area contained the 3D printers, of which there were many.</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201a3fcdeff11970b-pi" target="_blank"><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 20px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="3D printers" border="0" alt="3D printers" src="/assets/image_947177.jpg" width="408" height="280" /></a></p>  <p>With the results on display, too, of course.</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201a5118ea6d5970c-pi" target="_blank"><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 20px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="A 3D print" border="0" alt="A 3D print" src="/assets/image_218213.jpg" width="408" height="280" /></a></p>  <p>All in all it was an inspiring visit: Pier 9 is an incredibly creative environment and I hope the people working there realise how lucky they are to be housed in such an exceptional space. I’m really looking forward to visiting again!</p>
