<p>If you’re planning on attending AU 2025 in Nashville - and have an interest in software development, whether via code, low-code or no-code - then be sure to plan on being there for the pre-conference day on September 15th. There will be something for you.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Pre-AU 2025 events.gif" src="/assets/image_191459.jpg" alt="Pre-AU 2025 events." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></p>
<p>The Autodesk Platform Services team have organized their first Platform Leadership Forum, which will be held during the afternoon of the Monday before AU. You can find out specific details - including how to buy your ticket - in <a href="https://aps.autodesk.com/blog/new-year-join-us-platform-leadership-forum-au-2025-nashville-tn">this blog post</a>.</p>
<p>If you’re more interested in rolling up your sleeves and building something - and I’m going to guess that this year vibe-coding will be part of most team’s toolkits, given the single day format - then plan on attending the free Dynamo + APS Hackathon which will kick-off at 8am and run through the day. Details will be forthcoming in due course - for now <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7336446854429134848?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAAEoJABC7Crwb3MfK4Efj5C5hME676x40Y">the date has officially been saved</a>.</p>
<p>From my side I’m planning on being at the Hackathon in the morning but will probably head across to the PLF at least for some of the afternoon (depending on whether I’m needed to participate in the Hackathon or to advise teams that still need help by then).</p>
<p>If you end up attending either event, see you on September 15th!</p>
