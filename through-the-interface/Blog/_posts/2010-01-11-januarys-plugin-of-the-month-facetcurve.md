<p>Firstly, a slightly belated “Happy New Year!” to all of you. I’m now easing back into the saddle after three very relaxing weeks off with family and friends.</p>  <p>One of the first activities I had on my plate in 2010 was to tidy up the application I presented in <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2009/12/faceting-autocad-curves-using-net.html">this previous post</a> and turn it into January’s <a href="http://labs.autodesk.com/utilities/adn_plugins/">Plugin of the Month</a>, FacetCurve for AutoCAD. The original C++ application this plugin is based on was generously provided by Jon Smith from <a href="http://www.coins-global.com">COINS</a>, a long-time ADN member (thanks, Jon!).</p>  <p>You’ll find <a href="http://labs.blogs.com/its_alive_in_the_lab/2010/01/adn-plugin-of-the-month-facet-curve-for-autocad-now-available.html">the official announcement over on Scott’s blog</a>, in his trademark eye-catching style (I definitely get envious of Scott’s image gallery when I visit his blog ;-).</p>  <p>I’ll be knuckling down to post something more in-depth later in the week, by which time I’ll hopefully once again see the bottom of my inbox.</p>
