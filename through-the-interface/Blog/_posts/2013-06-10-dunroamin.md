<p>I’ve now finished my recent trio of long-haul trips: the San Francisco Bay Area in late April, Singapore in mid-May and Boston in early June. So I can take a breather for a few weeks (maybe even months), at least: I have no firm travel plans until AU, although no doubt something will come up before then.</p>  <p>[For those of you who aren’t familiar with it, the title of the post is a reference to a common British house name. In the UK people often name (or used to, anyway) their houses in this way to announce that they’re “Done Roaming – from now on I’ll stay here at home” (as explained in this description of Terry Pratchett’s meta-parody “<a href="http://wiki.lspace.org/mediawiki/index.php/Dunmanifestin" target="_blank">Dunmanifestin</a>”).]</p>  <p>During this last trip, in particular, there seemed to be a strong emphasis on upgrading my own use of travel-related technology. So this post is about that.</p>  <p>It started with my outbound travel to Boston. My aim was to go as paperless as possible, now that I finally have <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5973073/an-iphone-lovers-confession-i-switched-to-the-nexus-4-completely" target="_blank">a smartphone worth its salt</a>. I bought by rail ticket via <a href="http://www.sbb.ch/en/travelcards-and-tickets/e-tickets/mobileticket/sbb-mobile-android.html" target="_blank">the SBB mobile app</a> – no paper ticket needed. I also checked in for my flight via <a href="http://www.swiss.com/web/en/services/mobile_services/Pages/overview.aspx" target="_blank">the Swiss mobile app</a>, so no paper boarding pass needed there, either. So far, so good.</p>  <p>I ended up getting a normal taxi from the airport – which I paid for with folding money and needed to collect a paper receipt for the eventual expense claim – but I later found out that <a href="https://www.uber.com/cities/boston" target="_blank">Uber was available in Boston</a> (thanks to Nick Zeeben for the tip :-). This would have gotten me all the way door-to-door without worrying about a single piece of paper, but hey.</p>  <p>I did end up using Uber a couple of times, during my stay in Boston: to get home after an outing to the Red Sox with colleagues and then to get to the airport on Wednesday night. I’d previously signed up for Uber during a trip to Paris, but I hadn’t actually ended up using it: <a href="http://blog.uber.com/2013/06/04/boston-free-uberx-week" target="_blank">the Boston promotion</a> was the push I needed (and the service worked brilliantly, even with the additional demand caused by UBERx being free).</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20191032e59c4970c-pi" target="_blank"><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 0px 15px 0px 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; float: left; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="Zagster at the Hyatt" border="0" alt="Zagster at the Hyatt" align="left" src="/assets/image_12624.jpg" width="219" height="148" /></a>The other travel-related technology I ended up using was <a href="http://zagster.com" target="_blank">Zagster</a>. For $15 per day I rented a bicycle from <a href="http://cambridge.hyatt.com/en/hotel/home.html" target="_blank">the hotel in Cambridge</a> and used it to visit MIT, Harvard and downtown Boston. They provide you with a pin to unlock a compartment at the back of the bike that holds a key to the provided <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle_lock#U-locks_and_D-locks" target="_blank">D-lock</a>. All very clever.</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20192aaf6a265970d-pi" target="_blank"><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 0px 15px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; float: right; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="Hubway in Boston" border="0" alt="Hubway in Boston" align="right" src="/assets/image_538090.jpg" width="152" height="202" /></a>An alternative bicycle-sharing system in Boston is <a href="http://www.thehubway.com" target="_blank">Hubway</a>, which lets you pick up bikes and check them back in at locations all over the city. This can prove very cost-effective if you manage to time your trips to be less than 30 minutes between hubs, but I suspect I ended up being better off with Zagster for my particular usage pattern.</p>  <p><font color="#666666">photo credit: </font><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chasqui/6226182323/"><font color="#666666">Chasqui (Luis Tamayo)</font></a><font color="#666666"> via </font><a href="http://photopin.com"><font color="#666666">photopin</font></a><font color="#666666"> </font><a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/"><font color="#666666">cc</font></a></p>
