<p>After a relaxing long Easter weekend, on Wednesday I was back on the train to Zurich airport.<a href="/assets/image_927539.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Train to Neuchatel" src="/assets/image_927539.jpg" alt="Train to Neuchatel." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>This trip is primarily for events we’re holding in Boston and San Francisco, but we decided to insert a stop in Los Angeles between the two, to catch up with a number of people there and and to visit venues for the LA28 Olympic Games.</p>
<p>But first, I had to get to the E gates at Zurich airport. Not that this was particularly arduous, I just happened to snap a photo on the train that goes there.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_450936.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="The train to E gates" src="/assets/image_450936.jpg" alt="The train to E gates." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>I’ve recently been granted frequent flyer status by Swiss (this is not a badge of pride for me, but it does come in handy when checking bags or getting a snack before flying) so for once I spent some time in the lounge at the E gates.</p>
<p>It seems that whenever I travel with the family, someone has the dreaded “SSSS” on their boarding card, and so has to get the enhanced security check. This time - as I was traveling alone - it was my turn. Luckily it was quickly done, but after that I ended up hanging around the gate for boarding.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Wait at the gate" src="/assets/image_962306.jpg" alt="Wait at the gate." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></p>
<p>The plane wasn’t huge, so I managed to be sat in an aisle seat next to a window seat. The window seat was occupied by a young lady who was coughing <strong>a lot</strong>, so I’m hoping I'll get through the next week without falling sick myself.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_241589.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="The plane" src="/assets/image_241589.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>The flight was uneventful and I was very quickly through immigration upon arrival. I even had to wait a few minutes for my checked luggage (I really dislike checking luggage, but this was sadly unavoidable given the length of this trip and the variety of clothing I’ll need on it).</p>
<p>I'm staying at the Homewood Suites just along Drydock Avenue from the our Boston office. Here's the morning view from the 12th floor.<a href="/assets/image_503112.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><br /><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="View from the hotel" src="/assets/image_503112.jpg" alt="View from the hotel." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>I headed into the office bright and early, as I was attending a session of the <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2025/02/a-course-on-neuroscience-and-design-at-polidesign.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Neuroscience and Design class</a> from 8am to 1pm. (It's from 2pm to 7pm in Europe, so it fitted in very well with this week's timezone!)<a href="/assets/image_919980.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="23 Drydock" src="/assets/image_919980.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Parts of the office are very similar to <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2016/09/toronto-and-boston.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my last visit in 2016</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_557957.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="2nd floor Resident area" src="/assets/image_557957.jpg" alt="2nd floor Resident area." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a><a href="/assets/image_112903.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Gantry" src="/assets/image_112903.jpg" alt="" width="375" height="500" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Other parts are radically different, and for the better.<a href="/assets/image_624846.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Nice new look" src="/assets/image_624846.jpg" alt="Nice new look." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a><a href="/assets/image_836905.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="3rd floor open space" src="/assets/image_836905.jpg" alt="3rd floor open space." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a><a href="/assets/image_82024.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Presentation space" src="/assets/image_82024.jpg" alt="Presentation space." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a>One feature I was very impressed with was the fridge that was chock-full of Greek yoghurt. Yum.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_156829.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Greek yoghurt fridge" src="/assets/image_156829.jpg" alt="Greek yoghurt fridge." width="375" height="500" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Looking out across Drydock Avenue we had the treat of seeing a huge container ship being worked on.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_61872.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="That's a big ship" src="/assets/image_61872.jpg" alt="That's a big ship." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>I haven’t given regular updates on my Neuroscience and Design class - I’m learning a great deal, I’m happy to say - and the second of this week’s lectures was delivered by Suchi Reddy from New York. She’ll be at our event in Boston, which was a really interesting bit of synchronicity!</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_356000.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Neuroscience and Design class of April 24th" src="/assets/image_356000.jpg" alt="Neuroscience and Design class of April 24th." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>After the class was over, I headed for lunch with Dagmara, Jacky and Jon. Jon is based in Boston, so it was great to have the chance to hang out together.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_603605.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Kean, Dagmar, Jacky and Jon" src="/assets/image_603605.jpg" alt="Kean, Dagmar, Jacky and Jon." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Right afterwards we Lyfted across to Chandler Street, to the offices of MASS Design.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_761943.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Chandler St" src="/assets/image_761943.jpg" alt="Chandler St." width="375" height="500" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>MASS Design is an Autodesk Foundation partner and a good friend of Autodesk Research, so it was great to get a tour of the office and talk about our common interests.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_97465.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Visiting MASS" src="/assets/image_97465.jpg" alt="Visiting MASS." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_499945.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="MASS reception" src="/assets/image_499945.jpg" alt="MASS reception." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a>Our first night’s dinner was at Legal Seafoods, a Boston institution. And, most importantly, there’s one really close to the hotel.</p>
<p>That was it for Thursday… our big day in Boston is Friday, where we’ll be hosting our first event. I’ll explain more about what we’re trying to do with them next week.</p>
