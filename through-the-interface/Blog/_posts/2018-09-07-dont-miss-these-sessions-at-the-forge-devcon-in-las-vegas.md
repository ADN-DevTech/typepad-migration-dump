<p>The <a href="https://forge.autodesk.com/devcon" target="_blank">Forge DevCon</a> is a great place to dive deeply into what’s possible – and what will soon be possible – with the Forge platform. I’m involved in the organisation of the Las Vegas DevCon – being held on November 12-13, 2018 – in that I help lead one of the tracks.</p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad3af287e200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="250" title="The Forge DevCon is coming" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="The Forge DevCon is coming" src="/assets/image_764094.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>When the first DevCon took place, back in 2016, I was track-lead for the AR/VR track… these days I’m co-track-lead with my old friend Cyrille Fauvel for the Complementary Technologies track, which incorporates topics such as AR/VR, AI and robotics. All the really fun stuff, basically. ;-)</p><p><a href="https://forge.autodesk.com/devcon-2018" target="_blank">This year</a> there are 35 or so classes scheduled for the 2 days of the DevCon, of which 4 sessions belong to the “Comp Tech” track.</p><p>If you want to get a sense of really cool stuff that people are doing with Forge (and beyond!) you should attend these 4 classes. They blend cutting-edge R&amp;D with advanced use of Forge to do some really cool things.</p><ul><li><a href="https://autodeskuniversity.smarteventscloud.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=225495" target="_blank">Build a Machine Learning Valve Design App Using Autodesk Forge and simulationHub</a> (Sandip Jadhav)</li><li><a href="https://autodeskuniversity.smarteventscloud.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=227482" target="_blank">Using Forge Toward Human-Robot Collaboration in Architecture</a> (Lauren Vasey)</li><li><a href="https://autodeskuniversity.smarteventscloud.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=219643" target="_blank">Agile Construction: How Virtual Last Planner Input Is Optimized by Artificial Intelligence</a> (Chris Callen)</li><li><a href="https://autodeskuniversity.smarteventscloud.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=226835">Merging AI with BIM 360 to Reduce Safety Risk and Improve Progress Tracking: The Skanska Case Study</a> (Catherine Rose &amp; Josh Kanner)</li></ul><p>Unlike me, you can sign up right now for these classes. (Autodesk employees don’t get to sign-up in advance, which is completely appropriate. :-) Go ahead and reserve your spot today!</p><p>Next week I’ll be attending two events in the Zurich area: I’ve been asked to talk about <a href="htto://autodeskresearch.com" target="_blank">Autodesk Research</a> and <a href="http://dasher360.com" target="_blank">Dasher 360</a> at the <a href="https://swissbuildtec.ch/" target="_blank">Swiss Buildtec Alliance</a>’s autumn conference in Brugg on Wednesday, after which I’ll be spending the rest of the week at <a href="http://www.robarch2018.org/" target="_blank">Rob|Arch 2018</a> at ETH. With any luck I’ll get to meet Lauren Vasey (one of our DevCon speakers) there. It should be a really interesting week.</p>
