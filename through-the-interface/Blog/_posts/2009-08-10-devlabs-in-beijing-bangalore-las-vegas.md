<P>This post is to bring you up-to-date on DevLabs, an initiative I’ve mentioned a <A href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2009/04/introducing-devlabs.html">couple</A> of <A href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2009/05/devlabs-reminder.html">times</A> in recent months.</P>
<P>We’ve so far held two very successful DevLab events in Farnborough and San Francisco. The feedback we’ve received from attendees has been overwhelming positive, and the people from my team who hosted the events found the experience extremely rewarding.</P>
<P>So yes, full speed ahead with the remaining, scheduled DevLabs events in China and India:</P>
<ul>
<li>Beijing, China</li>
<ul>
<li>August 17-21, AutoCAD and Autodesk Inventor APIs</li>
<li>August 24-28, Geospatial and Revit APIs</li>
</ul>
<li>Bangalore, India</li>
<ul>
<li>September 8–11, Geospatial and Revit APIs</li>
<li>September 14-17, AutoCAD and Autodesk Inventor APIs</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<P>The events held so far have definitely left us considering running more in the future. We’re currently thinking about booking a meeting room at <A href="http://au.autodesk.com/">AU 2009</A> to hold a DevLab focused specifically on helping people migrate their AutoCAD code from VBA to VB.NET language (we would also help people moving to C#, of course, but the assumption is that VBA developers will generally choose VB.NET over C# given the familiarity of the syntax).</P>
<P>If you’re interested in attending any of these three events, please <A href="mailto:dev-consult@autodesk.com">send us an email</A>. We’re still just trying to gauge how well attended a DevLab held at AU would be – there’s already so much going on – so we need to hear from you if you believe you’d find this opportunity valuable.</P>
