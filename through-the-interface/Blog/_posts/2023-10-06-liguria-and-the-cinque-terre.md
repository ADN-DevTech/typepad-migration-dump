<p>On Saturday we packed the car and headed through the Grand San Bernard tunnel from Switzerland to Italy for a 6-day break. Our first stop across the border was in Aosta, where we started the carb-fest in earnest.</p>
<p>(Our eldest son has just started his 2nd year at university, so wasn't able to join us on this trip.)<a href="/assets/image_333574.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Starting strong" src="/assets/image_333574.jpg" alt="Starting strong" width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>After driving for the best part of 6 hours we arrived in the seaside town of Riva Trigoso, a suburb of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sestri_Levante" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sestri Levante</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_148787.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Our flat" src="/assets/image_148787.jpg" alt="Our flat" width="375" height="500" border="0" /></a>I'd booked this place (the weekend before, so cutting it fine!) based on a few criteria: it had to have a dog-friendly beach a short walk away, it had to have some kind of private parking and it had to be walking distance from a direct train line to the Cinque Terre. We weren't 100% sure that the place in Riva Trigoso ticked all the boxes, but despite <a href="https://www.blumenriviera.co.uk/beaches-liguria/dog-friendly/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not being listed as being dog-friendly</a> it turned out that Riva Trigoso's furthest section of beach welcomes dogs from October 1st to April 30th. Arriving on the evening of September 30th was perfect timing!<a href="/assets/image_913069.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="A dog-friendly beach" src="/assets/image_913069.jpg" alt="A dog friendly beach" width="375" height="500" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Riva Trigoso is actually a really interesting place. It's a lot more industrial than some seaside locations along the Ligurian coastline because of its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantiere_navale_di_Riva_Trigoso" target="_blank" rel="noopener">long history with ship-building</a>. Apparently the sea drops away very sharply from the beach, here, which makes it the perfect place to build boats.</p>
<p>You might think that having this along the beach would be an eye-sore, but I actually quite liked it, and found the town to be a lot more genuine and less touristy than many places nearby.<a href="/assets/image_95401.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><br /><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="The boatyard" src="/assets/image_95401.jpg" alt="The boatyard" width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>And having a place we could be with Daisy, our cocker spaniel, was basically a non-negotiable for this trip.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_210895.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="The dog beach" src="/assets/image_210895.jpg" alt="The dog beach" width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>If you looked the other way up the beach you could easily forget about the nearby industry.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_296026.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="The sea" src="/assets/image_296026.jpg" alt="The sea" width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>And Daisy had an absolute blast on the beach and at the edges of the ocean. Although she’s used to drinking lake-water, so her first sips of the sea did come as a bit of a shock.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_241103.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Daisy in the sea" src="/assets/image_241103.jpg" alt="Daisy in the sea" width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>I found myself relaxing immediately. The day before I'd been recording an hour-long AU presentation, and now here we were by the Mediterranean Sea.<a href="/assets/image_463473.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="A quick selfie on the beach" src="/assets/image_463473.jpg" alt="A quick selfie on the beach" width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Here's a snap of the family on our way back to the flat on this first evening.<a href="/assets/image_882691.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="The family as we head back to the flat" src="/assets/image_882691.jpg" alt="The family as we head back to the flat" width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_987129.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="View from the bridge" src="/assets/image_987129.jpg" alt="View from the bridge" width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>The sunset made for a lovely welcome to the area.<a href="/assets/image_235497.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="A lovely sunset" src="/assets/image_235497.jpg" alt="A lovely sunset" width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>My wife and I ended up heading down to the beach before sunrise, the following day, to let Daisy have a run around. And incidentally for her to be the first dog to enjoy the beach legally on October 1st.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_29860.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="The boatyard before dawn" src="/assets/image_29860.jpg" alt="The boatyard before dawn" width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_838936.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="The moon over the headland" src="/assets/image_838936.jpg" alt="The moon over the headland" width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a><a href="/assets/image_890710.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="A chilly morning" src="/assets/image_890710.jpg" alt="A chilly morning" width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Once everyone was finally up (we are the parents of teenagers, after all), we walked the 1.5 km (slightly longer than was ideal, but hey) to the local train station to take the 40-minute train across to the Cinque Terre.<a href="/assets/image_540536.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Waiting for the train to Riomaggiore" src="/assets/image_540536.jpg" alt="Waiting for the train to Riomaggiore" width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Here’s a photo I took later in the week that gives an idea of the distance from Riva Trigoso to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinque_Terre">Cinque Terre</a>. The villages of the Cinque Terre are Monterosso, Vernazza, Corniglia, Manarola and Riomaggiore.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_768916.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="The train" src="/assets/image_768916.jpg" alt="The train" width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Our big plan (which we admittedly didn’t spend a lot of time researching) was to walk between the various villages, starting with Riomaggiore and working back to Monterosso. While on the train to Riomaggiore we found our that the trail to Manarola (the cutely named Via dell’Amore) is closed for the next year or so because of a landslide.</p>
<p>So we hastily adjusted our plans to start the walk at Manarola, and jumped off the train to do so.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_302290.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="In Manarola with a million other people" src="/assets/image_302290.jpg" alt="In Manarola with a million other people" width="375" height="500" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>We would never come to Cinque Terre in the summer: we’ve heard too many horror stories about it being completely rammed with tourists (yes, like ourselves). So we hoped that coming in October would be better. It was still basically completely rammed, so I can only imagine how horrific it must be in the summer.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_524078.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="So many people" src="/assets/image_524078.jpg" alt="So many people" width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>There were some nice moments - it’s a very picturesque region - but I honestly would rather visit more off-the-beaten-path locations in Italy where you can breath and don’t have to pay Swiss prices for meals.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_404830.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Manarola" src="/assets/image_404830.jpg" alt="Manarola" width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a>We started the walk from Manarola up to Corniglia via the town of Volastra. We immediately found there to be way fewer people, which was a great relief.</p>
<p>There were some very curious details, such as steps built into the walls of the gardens we passed which skinny acrobats could presumably use to access their gardens.<a href="/assets/image_324191.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Lots of these little stone staircases" src="/assets/image_324191.jpg" alt="Lots of these little stone staircases" width="375" height="500" border="0" /></a></p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_766486.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="A shrine" src="/assets/image_766486.jpg" alt="A shrine" width="375" height="500" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Volastra was quite a way above Manarola, so dear little Daisy did soon get quite hot and tired. We stopped regularly (for everyone’s sake, in fairness) so the predicted 1 hour and 45 minutes hiking time quickly seemed utterly unrealistic.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_101686.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Daisy was getting tired and hot" src="/assets/image_101686.jpg" alt="Daisy was getting tired and hot" width="375" height="500" border="0" /></a></p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_200519.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Up the steps" src="/assets/image_200519.jpg" alt="Up the steps" width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>The views were absolutely spectacular, though. This is Manarola from the path from Volastra to Corniglia.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_182370.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="The view back towards Manarola" src="/assets/image_182370.jpg" alt="The view back towards Manarola" width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>And a little further along we could start to see Corniglia.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_978290.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="The view towards Corniglia" src="/assets/image_978290.jpg" alt="The view towards Corniglia" width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>We were surrounded by vineyards and lemon trees as we hiked.<a href="/assets/image_253076.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="A lovely path" src="/assets/image_253076.jpg" alt="A lovely path" width="375" height="500" border="0" /></a><a href="/assets/image_233038.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Just stunning" src="/assets/image_233038.jpg" alt="Just stunning" width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>After some time we reached a section with some shade, which was very welcome.<a href="/assets/image_793050.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Thankfully some shaded parts" src="/assets/image_793050.jpg" alt="Thankfully some shaded parts" width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_893729.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Some open stretches, too" src="/assets/image_893729.jpg" alt="Some open stretches too" width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a><a href="/assets/image_758884.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="The family" src="/assets/image_758884.jpg" alt="The family" width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Eventually - probably 3 hours into the walk! - we started to descend on Corniglia.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_493366.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Heading down towards Corniglia" src="/assets/image_493366.jpg" alt="Heading down towards Corniglia" width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Arriving in Corniglia, we looked for a decent place to eat, which turned out to be la Posada.<a href="/assets/image_524752.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Lunch at La Posada" src="/assets/image_524752.jpg" alt="Lunch at La Posada" width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>The food and the view were both fantastic.<a href="/assets/image_144100.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Oh yeah" src="/assets/image_144100.jpg" alt="Oh yeah" width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a><a href="/assets/image_657466.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="The view back towards Manarola" src="/assets/image_657466.jpg" alt="The view back towards Manarola" width="375" height="500" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>With our bellies full we decided to explore Corniglia a little before taking the train home. It was still quite busy, though at this time of day less than Manarola had been.<a href="/assets/image_249210.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="The centre of Corniglia" src="/assets/image_249210.jpg" alt="The centre of Corniglia" width="375" height="500" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>The small streets were very striking.<a href="/assets/image_659085.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Small streets" src="/assets/image_659085.jpg" alt="Small streets" width="375" height="500" border="0" /></a></p>

<p><a href="/assets/image_490745.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Still quite a lot of people" src="/assets/image_490745.jpg" alt="Still quite a lot of people" width="375" height="500" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>With Corniglia being nearly 100 metres above sea-level, the walk down to the train station was pretty wild.<a href="/assets/image_506722.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Walking down to the station" src="/assets/image_506722.jpg" alt="Walking down to the station" width="375" height="500" border="0" /></a><a href="/assets/image_74161.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="The station in Corniglia" src="/assets/image_74161.jpg" alt="The station in Corniglia" width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>On Monday the town of Riva Trigoso came to life. On the way back from our morning walk with Daisy, we stopped to get breakfast at a local market.<a href="/assets/image_992341.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Daisy waiting patiently" src="/assets/image_992341.jpg" alt="Daisy waiting patiently" width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>We then took the train to Vernazza with the aim of visiting the town before taking a ferry to Monterosso.<a href="/assets/image_23334.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Vernazza" src="/assets/image_23334.jpg" alt="Vernazza" width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>The visit of the town was nice: the below pictures don’t really show just how people there were in the main streets.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_607044.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="A doorway in a small street" src="/assets/image_607044.jpg" alt="A doorway in a small street" width="375" height="500" border="0" /></a></p>

<p>Here’s a view onto the port area. When we were down below and saw the hordes waiting to board the ferry - which is otherwise meant to be a fantastic way to see the villages of the Cinque Terre - we decided against our original plan. It was just too busy.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_898878.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="The ferry coming in" src="/assets/image_898878.jpg" alt="The ferry coming in" width="375" height="500" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>So we had a nice lunch and headed back to Riva Trigoso for a bit more beach time.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_757077.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="More great food" src="/assets/image_757077.jpg" alt="More great food" width="375" height="500" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>On the way to dinner in the evening, we took some shots of a spectacular sunset.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_384644.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="A gorgeous sunset" src="/assets/image_384644.jpg" alt="A gorgeous sunset" width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Here’s a quick panorama:</p>

<p>We ate at a local pizzeria/trattoria where we found reasonably priced - and very decent - food for the first time since our meal in Aosta.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_501904.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="A simple dinner at a local Trattoria" src="/assets/image_501904.jpg" alt="A simple dinner at a local Trattoria" width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>

<p>On Tuesday we ended up visiting Sestri Levante to do a little shopping - by this time we’d decided not to bother with the Cinque Terre (we’d visited 3 of the 5, and had had enough of the crowds). It was also very nice.<br /><a href="/assets/image_981934.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Sestri Levante" src="/assets/image_981934.jpg" alt="Sestri Levante" width="375" height="500" border="0" /></a><a href="/assets/image_62043.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="A walk along the sea-front" src="/assets/image_62043.jpg" alt="A walk along the sea front" width="375" height="500" border="0" /></a>We did have dinner back in Riva Trigoso, this time at <a href="https://www.legardenie.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Le Gardenie</a>, which was spectacularly good.<a href="/assets/image_549875.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Fritto misto" src="/assets/image_549875.jpg" alt="Fritto misto" width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a>On Wednesday, our last full day in the area, we decided to visit Bonassola, which was a few train stops before the Cinque Terre itself.</p>
<p>It's also very pretty and was basically deserted by comparison. This could also have been because the weather was less nice, but I suspect that wasn't the issue.<a href="/assets/image_840325.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Walking through Bonassola" src="/assets/image_840325.jpg" alt="Walking through Bonassola" width="375" height="500" border="0" /></a></p>

<p>There were lots of signs up saying “no dogs on the beach”, so to start with we respected the rules.</p>

Daisy was less ambitious, preferring to watch from the safety of the sand.</p>

Cinque Terre itself was beautiful but a bit bonkers, but the time we spent in Riva Trigoso itself was pure bliss.<a href="/assets/image_294590.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Smiles all around" src="/assets/image_294590.jpg" alt="Smiles all around" width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a>It was just the break I needed.<a href="/assets/image_53964.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="A fantastic break" src="/assets/image_53964.jpg" alt="A fantastic break" width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a>For our last dinner we couldn’t resist heading back to Le Gardenie.</p>

<p>On Thursday morning we packed up and headed home, stopping a few times on the way, before arriving back in Switzerland.</p>

We ate a lot, slept a lot, and rediscovered Lambrusco Rosso (I really like fizzy red wine, for some reason). We may not head back to the Cinque Terre anytime soon - unless really in the off-season, should one actually exist - but it’s not impossible that we head back to Riva Trigoso sometime again before too long.</p>
