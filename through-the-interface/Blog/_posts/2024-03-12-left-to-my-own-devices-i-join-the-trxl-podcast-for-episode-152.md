<p>Some weeks ago I joined Evan Troxel for a couple of hours to chat about my journey and some of the projects I’ve worked on.</p>
<p>I’ve enjoyed the TRXL podcast for some time, so it was a real honour to be invited on. Our discussion has just been published as <a href="https://www.trxl.co/152/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">episode 152</a>.</p>

<p>If you prefer video, here’s the version from YouTube:</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Evan’s a great interviewer: I enjoyed the session a great deal and I hope you do, too.</p>
<p>Listening back to it I realize there’s a lot more we could have talked about… hopefully Evan will invite me back on for another chat, at some point!</p>
