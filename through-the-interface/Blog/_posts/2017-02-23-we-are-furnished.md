<p>Our VR room received its finishing touches yesterday, when our furniture was delivered.</p> <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b8d263912a970c-pi" target="_blank"><img title="Our furniture" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 30px auto; border-left: 0px; display: block; padding-right: 0px" border="0" alt="Our furniture" src="/assets/image_983786.jpg" width="500" height="281"></a></p> <p>Even before being officially ready, the room has seen some more usage. A group of our Enterprise Support managers gave it a try recently after one of their meetings in the Neuchatel office, for instance.</p> <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b8d263912e970c-pi" target="_blank"><img title="More Autodeskers trying out VR" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 30px auto; border-left: 0px; display: block; padding-right: 0px" border="0" alt="More Autodeskers trying out VR" src="/assets/image_289885.jpg" width="500" height="281"></a></p> <p>Tomorrow I’ll host a “drop in” morning for local Autodesk employees to come by and try it out, which should be fun. I expect it’ll be a few weeks before everyone gets to try it, given the interest people have already expressed in what VR can offer Autodesk customers.</p>Before that, though, this afternoon I’ll head back across to Zürich to present on Forge and VR to a group of students at the ZHdK, the Zürcher Hochschule der Künste (Zürich Fine Arts University). It’ll be a good chance to show how the Forge viewer and WebVR are powering <a href="http://vrok.it/v2" target="_blank">the latest version of Vrok-It</a>, for instance.
