<p>Some of you may remember <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2015/01/recreating-the-star-wars-opening-crawl-in-autocad-using-f-part-1.html" target="_blank">this</a> <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2015/01/recreating-the-star-wars-opening-crawl-in-autocad-using-f-part-2.html" target="_blank">series</a> <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2015/01/recreating-the-star-wars-opening-crawl-in-autocad-using-f-part-3.html" target="_blank">of</a> <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2015/01/recreating-the-star-wars-opening-crawl-in-autocad-using-f-part-4.html" target="_blank">posts</a> from the beginning of the year (I also mentioned it in <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2015/12/merry-christmas-from-through-the-interface-from-through-the-interface.html" target="_blank">the last post</a>). It showed how you might use AutoCAD and .NET (in this case via F#) to animate the Star Wars opening crawl for the first 6 movies.</p>
<p>Back then I said I’d update the video series to include <em>Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens</em>, once it was released. Today is that day… due to some bizarre accident of international scheduling, I got to see it two days ago, here in Switzerland. I took a few snaps of the opening crawl and sent the transcription across to <a href="https://twitter.com/phalt_" target="_blank">Paul</a>, who owns and maintains the <a href="http://swapi.co" target="_blank">Star Wars API (SWAPI)</a> which my code uses to get the crawl text for the various films. Paul kindly updated the API, then it was just a matter of tweaking my code to allow entry of the number 7 at the prompt for the episode number.</p>
<p>So here it is: the opening crawl of <em>The Force Awakens</em> inside AutoCAD 2015 (to be consistent with the other videos I captured – it also works fine in 2016). You may <strong><u><em>not</em></u> </strong>want to watch this, if you haven’t seen the movie and want to wait until you have.</p>

<p>I <em>thoroughly</em> enjoyed this film. Maybe not quite as much as these guys – who were watching the evening showing after the one I saw – but I actually do think – despite the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/dec/17/star-wars-the-force-awakens-han-solo-plot-holes-and-family-connections-discuss-the-film-with-spoilers" target="_blank">usual concerns about some aspects of the plot (contains spoilers)</a> – that it was <strong>the best</strong> of the series, so far. <u>Including the original trilogy</u>. I did not expect to be saying that, but there you have it.</p>

<p>I’ll be going back to watch it again with the kids, as soon as I get the chance. No, I didn’t take them, the first time, as I needed to research the level of violence, etc. (ahem.) Anyway – I’m now convinced I can take two of my three without any issues (the youngest will get to watch it once it gets released for smaller screens).</p>
<p>If you get the chance to watch it over the coming days, enjoy!</p>
