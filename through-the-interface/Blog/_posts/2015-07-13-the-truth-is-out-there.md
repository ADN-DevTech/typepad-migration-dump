An old friend and colleague from the UK, Nick Manning, typically comes across to talk at the event, as well as to present the <a href="http://www.nifff.ch/2015/site/en/program/imaging-the-future" target="_blank">Imaging the Future</a> award: 5,000 CHF for the international competition film with the best production design. The 2015 winner was a post-apocalyptic Ethiopian movie called <a href="http://www.nifff.ch/2015/site/en/program&amp;mid=Crumbs_1429002076" target="_blank">Crumbs</a>.</p>  <p>This year’s festival – the 15th edition – closed its doors on Saturday. Over the years the NIFFF has really grown in stature, and regularly attracts impressive guest speakers from the film industry and beyond, such as – to name just a few of my personal favourites – <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Harryhausen" target="_blank">Ray Harryhausen</a> (<a href="http://www.nifff.ch/2015/site/en/the-festival/archive/2003" target="_blank">2003</a>), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Gilliam" target="_blank">Terry Gilliam</a> (<a href="http://www.nifff.ch/2015/site/en/the-festival/archive/2005" target="_blank">2005</a>), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_A._Romero" target="_blank">George Romero</a> (<a href="http://www.nifff.ch/2015/site/en/the-festival/archive/2006" target="_blank">2006</a>), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_R._R._Martin" target="_blank">George R. R. Martin</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Smith" target="_blank">Kevin Smith</a> (both in <a href="http://www.nifff.ch/2015/site/en/the-festival/archive/2014" target="_blank">2014</a>).</p>  <p>I usually try to get down to see at least one film, during the week, but as the festival falls during the school holidays – and the majority of the films screened aren&#39;t kid-friendly, even if we happen to be in town – it’s not always possible. This year I was delighted to make it along to a Q&amp;A session with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Carter_(screenwriter)" target="_blank">Chris Carter</a>, the creator of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_X-Files" target="_blank">The X-Files</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_(TV_series)" target="_blank">Millennium</a>. (The following day there was a Q&amp;A with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Moorcock" target="_blank">Michael Moorcock</a>, author of the amazing <a href="https://Elric of Melniboné" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elric_of_Melnibon%C3%A9">Elric of Melniboné</a> series… sadly I couldn’t make it to both in person, but at least I managed to catch it <a href="https://livestream.com/accounts/9116901/events/4163482/player?autoPlay=true&amp;mute=false" target="_blank">online</a>.)</p>  <p>During the 90s I was a big fan of The X-Files… I don’t think I finished the last few seasons, but I did really love the show. That said, I knew I wasn’t enough of a fan to ask an intelligent question of the show’s creator. With that in mind – and for a bit of fun – I decided to reach out via the Twitterverse and find out if anyone had a question for me to ask. To my delight, someone actually responded with a question.</p>  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en">   <p dir="ltr" lang="en"><a href="https://twitter.com/keanw">@keanw</a> you&#39;ll have my undying gratitude if you ask chris carter about william</p> — flora → (@GirlinNumber9) <a href="https://twitter.com/GirlinNumber9/status/618684590857826305">July 8, 2015</a></blockquote>  <p>I did need some additional clarification on who William was (my memory failed me), so there were a few further interactions via Twitter plus some searching on the web. (It turns out <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_minor_The_X-Files_characters#Baby_William" target="_blank">William was Scully’s – and Mulder’s – son</a>. Who knew?)</p>  <p>Armed with my question, I headed down to the Q&amp;A. I was in the second row, so had a great seat from which to experience the event:</p>  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en">   <p dir="ltr" lang="en">At the <a href="https://twitter.com/nifff">@NIFFF</a>... <a href="http://t.co/Bv7IwfQx4C">pic.twitter.com/Bv7IwfQx4C</a></p> — Kean Walmsley (@keanw) <a href="https://twitter.com/keanw/status/618785110146551808">July 8, 2015</a></blockquote>  <p>I eventually built up the courage to blurt the question out… you can hear it below at the 57m30s mark (although if you’re an X-Files fan you’ll no doubt find value in the rest of the recording, too).</p>  <p style="text-align: center">   <br /><iframe frameborder="0" height="315" scrolling="no" src="http://livestream.com/accounts/9116901/events/4163481/videos/92476494/player?width=560&amp;height=315&amp;autoPlay=false&amp;mute=false" width="560"></iframe>    <br /></p>  <p>By the time we’d all filed out of the theatre, I’d already received a tweet from the person for whom I’d asked the question. She’d clearly been watching via the live stream.</p>  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en">   <p dir="ltr" lang="en"><a href="https://twitter.com/keanw">@keanw</a> you did it! THANK YOU</p> — flora → (@GirlinNumber9) <a href="https://twitter.com/GirlinNumber9/status/618797793403121664">July 8, 2015</a></blockquote>  <p>I was happy to do it: it gave me the chance to ask a question that didn’t make me look too stupid and helped hardcore fans find out something useful about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_X-Files_(miniseries)" target="_blank">upcoming 6 revival episodes</a>.</p>  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en">   <p dir="ltr" lang="en"><a href="https://twitter.com/keanw">@keanw</a> you made many <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/XFiles?src=hash">#XFiles</a> fans REALLY happy so - as i said earlier - undying gratitude from all of us ♥</p> — flora → (@GirlinNumber9) <a href="https://twitter.com/GirlinNumber9/status/618799459414241280">July 8, 2015</a></blockquote> <script charset="utf-8" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" type="text/javascript"></script>  <p>It was certainly an interesting experiment: acting as an interface between those present both physically and virtually. It definitely struck me how things are changing in that regard: such as during the last few <a href="http://au.autodesk.com" target="_blank">Autodesk Universities</a>, where there’s been a much greater emphasis on people attending virtually, with tweets integrated into the physical conference via wall-screens, etc. We’ve already seen huge progress made over the last few years… and tools are being developed all the time to further abolish the physical/virtual divide. Interesting times!</p>
