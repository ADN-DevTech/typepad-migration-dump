<p>I’ll be delivering a Facecast on AutoCAD Customization <strong>next Tuesday, July 19th 2011</strong> at <strong>5pm CET / 8am PST</strong>. If you’d like to attend, please RSVP via <a href="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=210828742296235" target="_blank">this Facebook page</a>. The timing on the page seems to be for 3 hours, but I’ve been told the session will last around 30 minutes.</p>  <p>I’ll embed a viewer onto the Facecast – for people to watch live and after the fact – inside a blog post on Tuesday, so you can also just come here, then.</p>  <p>If you need some help working out the time of the session in your location, I recommend using <a href="http://www.worldtimebuddy.com" target="_blank">worldtimebuddy.com</a>. Here’s a link to <a href="http://www.worldtimebuddy.com/meeting?lid=1850147,1816670,1277333,524901,293397,2659496,5128581,4699066,5419384,5391959&amp;h=2659496&amp;sts=21850440&amp;sl=17-17" target="_blank">this particular meeting</a>.</p>  <p>I’m keen to get some questions in advance of the session, so if you have something you’d like me to address during those 30 minutes – time permitting! :-) – please <a href="mailto:kean.walmsley@autodesk.com" target="_blank">send me an email</a> or post a comment, below.</p>
