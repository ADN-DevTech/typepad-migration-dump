<p>It’s been an exciting week, here in New Zealand. Not only does the country have <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/20/new-zealand-jacinda-ardern-priorities-climate-inequality-women-cannabis" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a new coalition government</a> (which – somewhat controversially – doesn’t include the party who finished in first place in the recent election), but the polls have just closed on the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/ng-interactive/2017/oct/21/new-zealand-bird-of-the-year-leaderboard-check-the-pecking-order" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bird of the Year contest</a> (my vote goes to the Kea, because it has an awesome name). Crazy days.</p>
<p>After leaving <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2017/10/auckland.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Auckland</a> and then seeing <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2017/10/waitomo.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Waitomo</a> on Monday and <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2017/10/hobbiton.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Hobbiton</a> on Tuesday of last week, we arrived on Tuesday evening in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotorua" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Rotorua</a>. (I can’t believe I’m somehow now nearly a week behind on posts… there’s just too much going on during this leg of the tour to keep up. I’m going to have to compress more days into single posts and/or increase the posting frequency until I get back on top of the situation.)</p>
<p>We once again ended up using CamperMate (which has really become our go-to tool for our NZ accommodation) to select a campsite for the evening. We chose the <a href="http://cosycottage.co.nz/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Cozy Cottage Thermal Holiday Park</a>, mainly because of its onsite hotspring baths and its easy access to the town. It also turns out we could have cooked our dinner using a special variation of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C4%81ngi" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Hāngi</a> that uses geothermal energy to cook. If we’d arrived a little earlier we’d have absolutely have done that (how amazing would it be to cook with geothermal heat, after all?). Next time.</p>
<p>After making the most of the hot springs – I soaked for an hour on both Tuesday night and early Wednesday morning before we hit the road – we visited the main attraction that had brought us to Rotorua: <a href="https://www.whakarewarewa.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Whakarewarewa</a>, the living Maori village. Or Tewhakarewarewatangaoteopetauaawahiao in the Maori language. Which is really cool – it apparently uses all of the letters in the Maori alphabet except for “M”.</p>
<p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201bb09cfe3d0970d-pi" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img alt="Tewhakarewarewatangaoteopetauaawahiao" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_171635.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="Tewhakarewarewatangaoteopetauaawahiao" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>The inhabitants of this village all make use of geothermal power to live: to cook their food and to bathe. They apparently don’t need to heat their homes, as you can always dip in a hot spring when you get cold.</p>
<p>Here’s where food gets cooked:</p>
<p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201bb09cfe3d8970d-pi" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img alt="Cooking with geothermal energy" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_499809.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="Cooking with geothermal energy" width="500" /></a><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b8d2b72a6e970c-pi" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img alt="A geothermal cooking station" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_293937.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="A geothermal cooking station" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>The water for bathing comes from a main pool:</p>
<p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b7c92cbd03970b-pi" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img alt="One source of the village&#39;s heat" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_412715.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="One source of the village&#39;s heat" width="500" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b7c92cbd07970b-pi" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img alt="Every hour or so there&#39;s an increase in activity" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_163648.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="Every hour or so there&#39;s an increase in activity" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>The water from the pool is channeled to bathing pools:</p>
<p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b8d2b72a7f970c-pi" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img alt="The water travels across to the bathing area" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_803069.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="The water travels across to the bathing area" width="500" /></a><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b8d2b72a83970c-pi" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img alt="A channel to a bathing bool" border="0" height="500" src="/assets/image_883605.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="A channel to a bathing bool" width="375" /></a></p>
<p>The village is definitely living: while many of the inhabitants work outside the village – and return after 5pm when the village is closed to tourists – there were various active projects in evidence.</p>
<p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b8d2b72a88970c-pi" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img alt="All sorts of activities - including boat repair - is ongoing in the village" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_477520.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="All sorts of activities - including boat repair - is ongoing in the village" width="500" /></a><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b7c92cbd19970b-pi" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img alt="The central meeting hall" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_60230.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="The central meeting hall" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>After our tour of the village, we stopped to eat a geothermally cooked meal in their restaurant (as we hadn’t been able to cook our own the evening before, this seemed like a great opportunity).</p>
<p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201bb09cfe3f7970d-pi" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img alt="A geothermally cooked meal" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_195080.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="A geothermally cooked meal" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>After this we attended a show performed by local dancers.</p>
<p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201bb09cfe403970d-pi" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img alt="A performance by local dancers" height="281" src="/assets/image_27046.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; float: none; display: block;" title="A performance by local dancers" width="500" /></a><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b7c92cbd3b970b-pi" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img alt="A photo with the Walmsley family" border="0" height="500" src="/assets/image_777929.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="A photo with the Walmsley family" width="375" /></a></p>
<p>To wrap up our visit to Whakarewarewa, we went for a quick walk around its lake.</p>
<p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b8d2b72a9e970c-pi" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img alt="The nearby lake" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_924091.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="The nearby lake" width="500" /></a><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b8d2b72aa2970c-pi" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img alt="A hot pool by the lake" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_108222.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="A hot pool by the lake" width="500" /></a><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b8d2b72aab970c-pi" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img alt="Walking around the lake" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_366651.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="Walking around the lake" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>It was a really interesting experience: we really enjoyed learning how people in this area have been able to harness the power of the earth for generations upon generations. Long may it last!</p>
<p>We had considered staying in the town of Taupo – on the lake of the same name – after our visit to Rotorua, but ended up opting to power on southwards. CamperMate showed us a free Department of Conservation campsite in Omori, on the other side of Lake Taupo, right next to “Fish Beach”.<a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b7c92cbea3970b-pi" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img alt="On the shore of Lake Taupo" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_99302.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="On the shore of Lake Taupo" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Lake Taupo is beautiful: it reminds us a lot of Switzerland, apart from two main things. Firstly, the <a href="http://nzbirdsonline.org.nz/species/black-swan" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">swans are black</a>. And not the odd one… all of them. (Which makes me think of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Black_Swan:_The_Impact_of_the_Highly_Improbable" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Taleb’s book</a>, of course.) The second thing we discovered on waking up, bright and early: the kids started playing on Fish Beach, right next to our van, and quickly found that all the rocks on the beach were pumice. They floated when thrown into the lake – the kids found that awesome fun.</p>
<p>They also fashioned tools from pieces of wood and used them to “drill” holes into the stones to make pendants, which was really nice, too.</p>
<p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b8d2b72bef970c-pi" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img alt="Pumice on Fish Beach" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_739279.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="Pumice on Fish Beach" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>We left from here to head south, and decided to leave as little distance to travel to Wellington (the next day) as possible. CamperMate found us a great stop an hour or so north of the capital: the driveway of the Celtic Organic Winery (I know, right? :-).</p>
<p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b7c92cbea7970b-pi" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img alt="The Celtic Organic Winery" border="0" height="500" src="/assets/image_745773.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="The Celtic Organic Winery" width="375" /></a></p>
<p>We had a great night’s sleep – not unaided by Celtic Organic Wine – before we popped along to Hokio Beach to check out the whitebaiters: fishermen who catch <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitebait" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">whitebait</a> (small fish destined to be eaten whole) by the netfull.</p>
<p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201bb09cfe57e970d-pi" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img alt="The view across to the whitebaiters" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_126655.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="The view across to the whitebaiters" width="500" /></a><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b7c92cbeb0970b-pi" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img alt="Whitebaiters on Horoki Beach" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_332419.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="Whitebaiters on Horoki Beach" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>From here we headed down to Wellington for a lunchtime appointment.</p>
<p>Here’s our journey through the North Island:</p>
<p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201bb09cfe589970d-pi" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img alt="Our journey through the New Zealand&#39;s North Island" border="0" height="500" src="/assets/image_220640.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="Our journey through the New Zealand&#39;s North Island" width="383" /></a></p>
<p>In the next post we’ll talk about Wellington, before moving onto the South Island.</p>
