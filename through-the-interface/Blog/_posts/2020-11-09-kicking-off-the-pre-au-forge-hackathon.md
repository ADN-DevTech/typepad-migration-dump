<blockquote><p><em>‘Twas the week before AU, when all around the globe,</em></p><p><em>developers began coding, into Forge did they probe.</em></p><p align="right"><em>Unknown</em></p></blockquote><p>Before Autodesk University kicks off, next week, our Developer Advocacy and Support team is running the inaugural Forge Hackathon. I <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2020/10/aec-and-forge-hackathons.html" target="_blank">talked about this event a month ago</a>: hopefully some of you saw that and decided to sign up.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20263e975bfe6200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="416" height="500" title="Pre-AU Forge Hackathon" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Pre-AU Forge Hackathon" src="/assets/image_955052.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>By all accounts it’s well subscribed, either way: I see 45 team channels in Slack, and people have started talking about their various hacks.</p><p>We started today with an introduction for Asia and Europe. Cyrille Fauvel kicked things off and introduced – among other things – the prize categories for the week’s event:</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20263e975bfe8200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="183" title="Cyrille presenting the prize categories" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Cyrille presenting the prize categories" src="/assets/image_648924.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Next Adam Nagy introduced the various Forge tutorials and&nbsp; training resources that are available to contestants (and anyone!):</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20263e975bfee200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="225" title="Adam introducing Forge" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Adam introducing Forge" src="/assets/image_771572.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Petr Broz then talked about the Model Derivative API and the Viewer, including a particular focus on one of my favourite topics – using Forge to develop digital twins:</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2026bdea31b05200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="268" title="Peter B talking about digital twins" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Peter B talking about digital twins" src="/assets/image_638064.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>After this Madhukar Moogala talked about Design Automation APIs and then Zhong Wu talked about the APIs available for BIM 360. (Unfortunately I had another meeting to join, so couldn’t stay for these last two sessions.)</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/keanw/status/1324334107728465920" target="_blank">Something I mentioned on Twitter</a>, but felt it’s worth repeating here, is that if there are teams focused on developing digital twins using Forge, please feel free to reach out: I’d be happy to share my experiences from working on Project Dasher, and answer any questions you might have about it. I’m on the shared Slack instance, so just let me know! </p><p>I’m looking forward to seeing the results of this Hackathon: the winning projects will be showcased next week during a special AU session, which will give some (no doubt well-deserved) recognition to the winning teams.</p>
