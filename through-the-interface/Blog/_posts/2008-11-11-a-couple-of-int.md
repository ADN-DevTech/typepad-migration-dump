<p>A couple of posts on other blogs that may be of interest to this blog's readership:</p> <p><a href="http://dwf.blogs.com/beyond_the_paper/2008/11/cab-files-present-vs-cab-files-future.html">CAB Files Present vs. CAB Files Future</a>: over on Beyond the Paper, Volker Joseph raises the possibility of Autodesk Design Review moving from a simple CAB distribution model to one which would allow installation of pre-requisite modules (presumably such as the .NET Framework), which would result in a larger distribution. If you have an opinion - one way or another - on this topic, please post a comment on Volker's blog.</p> <p><a href="http://aubeat.podbean.com/2008/11/10/autodesk-developer-network-adn-support-and-expertise-from-concept-to-market/">Autodesk Developer Network (ADN): Support and Expertise from Concept to Market</a>: over on AU Beat there's an audio interview with Jim Quanci (my manager) and Stephen Preston (who manages our DevTech team for the Americas). They talk about ADN and our presence at this year's <a href="http://au.autodesk.com/event">Autodesk University</a>. Happy listening! :-)</p>
