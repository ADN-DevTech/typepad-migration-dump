<p>Autodesk Platform Services – the platform formerly known as Forge – has <a href="https://forge.autodesk.com/blog/call-beta-participation-aec-cloud-information-model-api" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a brand new service that’s soon going into beta</a>: the AEC Cloud Information Model API.</p>
<p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202ae7b0826af200b-pi" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img width="500" height="281" title="AIM Beta" style="margin: 30px auto; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="AIM Beta" src="/assets/image_811671.jpg" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>This API will allow you to access design parameters in Revit models hosted in the cloud with no need to pass by an instance Revit.</p>
<p>The managed beta will give you access to data extracted from a fixed set of Revit sample models that is then hosted in the Autodesk Construction Cloud. It’ll be a great way to understand how the API works and provide feedback to the engineering team to steer the offering in the direction that makes sense for your business.</p>
<p>Here’s what you’ll be able to do with this beta:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Navigate to a hub, project, into a design and all the way down to an entity, its parameters, and their values</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Query across designs within a project to retrieve entities that match specified filter criteria. Example - Extract volume of concrete across Revit models for a project</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Query design entities based on their classifications (Category like door, window, pipe etc.), property groups (Dimension, Materials &amp; Finishes, Identity Data, etc.) and properties (Parameter Name, Value, etc.). Example – Retrieve dimension and material information for all the windows in a design</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>List all available property groups and properties available in a design</p>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The API access will be via GraphQL, which seems to be the best way to access design data, right now: it’s proven very effective for the <a href="https://forge.autodesk.com/fusion-data-cover-page" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fusion Data API</a>, for instance.</p>
<p>The instructions to sign up for this API are at the bottom of <a href="https://forge.autodesk.com/blog/call-beta-participation-aec-cloud-information-model-api" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the blog post</a> – you just need to provide some information by email and you’ll be signed up.</p>
