<p>I had a reminder from the Autodesk Developer Network team about <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2013/09/autodesk-devdays-2013.html" target="_blank">their upcoming DevDays tour</a> (of which I’m currently planning on attending the sessions in Las Vegas and Munich, although I’m not 100% sure I’ll get to Munich). One thing I didn’t fully appreciate when I wrote my previous post is that the ADN team is very actively looking to engage with non-ADN members who would like to attend this tour.</p>  <p>If you’re interested in attending a session – and aren’t currently an ADN member – then please <a href="http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/index?siteID=123112&amp;id=473880" target="_blank">get in touch with a member of our ADN team</a>. There isn’t a requirement to be a paid member of ADN to attend, but you will need to sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement: we’ll be presenting confidential material about technology that hasn’t been publicly announced.</p>  <p>This is a great way to get early information on what’s coming from Autodesk’s various product divisions – something that can be extremely valuable when planning your own development roadmaps. You just can’t talk about confidential content with anyone who isn’t bound by the same NDA before a public announcement has been made.</p>  <p>Hopefully I’ll see some of you there!</p>
