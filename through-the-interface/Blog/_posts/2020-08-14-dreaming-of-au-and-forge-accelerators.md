<p>This has been a strange week, at least in terms of dreams. I mentioned earlier in the week (on <a href="https://twitter.com/keanw/status/1293568456412008448" target="_blank">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6699332986690662400/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>) that I’d had a dream about <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/autodesk-university/" target="_blank">Autodesk University</a> where I was only partially present: I was running between meetings while everyone else was having fun attending sessions and hanging out at social events. I also noted this wasn’t so very different from reality (at least the way I perceive it), but that’s just me playing the victim. I love AU even if it’s always a bit hectic.</p><p>I have a feeling this dream was probably triggered by last week’s class acceptance email, which means I’ll certainly be participating in this year’s all-digital AU in some capacity (and hope to do more, too).</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2026be408712f200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="329" title="AU 2020 acceptance" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="AU 2020 acceptance" src="/assets/image_1808.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Last night I had an even stranger dream: I was late for dinner with some childhood friends – mainly because I was killing time by snowboarding, go figure – and when I eventually turned up, apologising profusely, I realised it was also the celebration dinner for a Forge Accelerator, and I was actually expected to join a different table than the one with my old friends. They were very understanding, which was nice of them.</p><p>This dream was almost certainly triggered by <a href="https://forge.autodesk.com/blog/forge-lighting-talks-pre-accelerator" target="_blank">a blog post of Jaime’s</a>, which I remember reading before turning in and saying to myself “I really must blog about that tomorrow”. Which I suppose I’m doing now, just not quite as I’d expected to.</p><p>Jaime’s post mentions the upcoming virtual <a href="https://forge.autodesk.com/accelerator-program" target="_blank">Forge Accelerator</a> – codenamed Rapa Nui, <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2017/10/easter-island.html" target="_blank">one of the favourite destinations</a> on <a href="https://www.keanw.com/round-the-world/" target="_blank">our round-the-world tour of 2017</a> – which is coming up from August 24th-28th. He was highlighting some pre-Accelerator sessions – scheduled for <strong>August 18th and 19th</strong> – that are open for all to attend: if you’re working with Forge (or interested in doing so), then I encourage you to sign up. The sessions will no doubt be highly informative, as ever.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2026be4087136200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="281" title="Rapa Nui lighting talks" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Rapa Nui lighting talks" src="/assets/image_842222.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>It seems it’s also not too late to sign up for the Rapa Nui accelerator – or the one coming a month after it codenamed Asgard, in case the timing doesn’t work – so do consider applying to attend one of those, too. It’s a great way to kickstart or accelerate your application development with Forge. I expect I’ll be talking about some recent updates I’ve made to Dasher during one or other (maybe even both?) of these events, too.</p><p>So what’s with all these dreams I’ve been having? At some level I suspect they’re simply telling me that I miss attending this type of event and the human contact they bring. I am appreciating the reduction in travel this pandemic has brought – and the chance to spend more time with family – but I do miss connecting with people in-person. Hopefully things will start to free up a bit as we head towards 2021…</p>
