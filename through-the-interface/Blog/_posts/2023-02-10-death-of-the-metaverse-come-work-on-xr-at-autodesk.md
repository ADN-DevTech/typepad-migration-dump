<p>You don’t have to look far, these days, to find dire prognostications about the <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90843767/is-the-metaverse-already-dead" target="_blank">death of the Metaverse</a>.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202b7517034f3200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="500" title="An image generated using Midjourney for this post" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="An image generated using Midjourney for this post" src="/assets/image_416977.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>That’s the nature of the hype cycle: those without the patience to help push technology through the <em>Trough of Disillusionment</em> move on to other things. Although the speed with which the Metaverse passed the <em>Peak of Inflated Expectations</em> in 2022 is impressive.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202b751948565200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="460" title="Gartner Hype Cycle for Emerging Tech, 2022" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Gartner Hype Cycle for Emerging Tech, 2022" src="/assets/image_161737.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Interestingly the Gartner Hype Cycle for 2016 reported Virtual Reality as having emerged onto the <em>Slope of Enlightenment</em>, but even at this time <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2017/03/autodesks-early-role-in-the-vr-revolution.html" target="_blank">I felt this was premature</a>. These models do have to be seen as what they are: approximations or best guesses regarding the future… not everything on there will make it through to the right of the curve, either.</p><p>One of the reasons for the Metaverse losing its shine is that there’s a new game in town. And if you’re always chasing shiny new objects, this latest one is in many ways more impressive as it’s <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2023/01/reflections-on-whats-coming-in-2023.html" target="_blank">much easier to chat with</a>.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202b6852779d5200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="A random but relevant meme from Twitter" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="A random but relevant meme from Twitter" src="/assets/image_482425.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p align="center"><em>Seen </em><a href="https://twitter.com/jeames_hanley/status/1623870851476226048" target="_blank"><em>on Twitter</em></a></p><p>At Autodesk we continue to see value in XR workflows for our customers, irrespective of the maturity of a supporting, widely adopted Metaverse platform: it’s the workflows that matter. And should a Metaverse end up appearing, at some point in the future, we’ll have technology to integrate into it, should that make sense.</p><p>As <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2022/07/come-work-on-xr-technologies-at-autodesk.html" target="_blank">I’ve mentioned before</a>, my old friend <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/casallas/" target="_blank">Sebastian Casallas</a> is engineering manager for our XR team and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7029267382057533440" target="_blank">has a number of software development positions open</a>.
