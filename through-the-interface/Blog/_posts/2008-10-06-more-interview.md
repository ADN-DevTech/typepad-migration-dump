<p>Thanks to all who have provided feedback on my recent <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2008/09/an-interview-wi.html">interview with John Walker</a>. Here is <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/files/an_interview_with_john_walker.pdf">a PDF of the complete series</a> for those who would rather use that format for offline viewing (please think twice before printing all 27 pages, though). The interview proved to be a very interesting activity - even more so than I had anticipated - and so I've decided to try a few more. I'm in no danger of making a career of this (don't worry) but I'm finding it an interesting diversion to meet and talk with people who have important information to share with this blog's readership.</p>

<p>With that in mind I headed across to the UK last week. The primary reason was to attend internal meetings in Autodesk's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farnborough,_Hampshire">Farnborough</a> office, but once they were finished I headed up to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge">Cambridge</a>. I'm actually from that part of the world - I grew up 35 miles <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/WindowsLiveWriter/Microsoft%20Research%20visitor%20badge.png"><img height="116" alt="Microsoft Research visitor badge" src="/assets/Microsoft%20Research%20visitor%20badge_thumb.png" width="180" align="right" border="0" style="BORDER-TOP-WIDTH: 0px; BORDER-LEFT-WIDTH: 0px; BORDER-BOTTOM-WIDTH: 0px; BORDER-RIGHT-WIDTH: 0px" /></a>north of Cambridge - so it was quite nostalgic for me to spend time in the city. My main purpose for visiting Cambridge was the <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/aboutmsr/labs/cambridge/">Microsoft Research</a> facility there: I'd been in touch with <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/~dsyme/">Don Syme</a> (the father of <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/projects/fsharp/">F#</a>) over the last few weeks and he had very kindly agreed to meet with me to talk in person. I spent the best part of the day with Don: we talked at great length about AutoCAD's architecture and Autodesk's software in general, and also about the significance of F# for our industry. I recorded about 45 minutes of dialog which will form the basis of an interview to be published via this blog.</p>

<p>The day ended with an impromptu demo of <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2007/11/a-mathematical-.html">the more visually compelling of the F# samples I've integrated into AutoCAD</a>, as well as a brief description of my recent <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2008/07/a-simple-3d-log.html">C#/F# LOGO implementation inside AutoCAD</a>. Aside from Don, the attendees were <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/~akenn/">Andrew Kennedy</a> (who is responsible for <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/andrewkennedy/archive/2008/08/20/units-of-measure-in-f-part-one-introducing-units.aspx">the Units of Measure implementation in F#</a>, something I'm going to dive into soon), <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/~jamarg/">James Margetson</a> (the other original member of the F# team who happened to write the base sample I integrated into AutoCAD) and <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/~bycook/">Byron Cook</a> (who I immediately recognised from his <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/posts/Charles/Byron-Cook-Terminator-Proving-Good-Things-Will-Eventually-Happen/">Channel 9</a> <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/shows/Going+Deep/Byron-Cook-Inside-Terminator/">appearances</a>). I'm very grateful to Don and co. for taking the time to talk with me. </p>

<p>Don also gave me a signed copy of his book, Expert F#. I've so far only flicked through it, but at first glance it's a very interesting volume which I'm sure will help greatly with my efforts to sharpen my functional programming skills. With any luck I'll have a few more to give away at <a href="http://au.autodesk.com/sessions/detail/2679/">my upcoming F# session at Autodesk University</a>.</p>

<p>Right... I'd better get started with converting my recording of the interview into printable text. Hopefully I'll have something to post by Friday.</p>
