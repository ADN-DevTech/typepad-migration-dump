<p>There’s <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/249955632/" target="_blank">a very interesting job posting</a> that I wanted to highlight for readers of this blog: Autodesk’s Immersive Experiences Group (IXG) is seeking a Senior Evangelist for Augmented and Virtual Reality. IXG is a fairly recently named group at Autodesk: I’m curious about the choice of the term Immersive, as my understanding is that the organisation’s mandate is very much also about Augmented and Mixed Reality, which for me is more <em>contextual</em> than <em>immersive</em>. But frankly that’s a minor detail: IXG does have a nice ring to it, and we do love our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-letter_acronym" target="_blank">TLAs</a> at Autodesk.</p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201bb09a38d2e970d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="334" title="This could be your audience" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="This could be your audience" src="/assets/image_565231.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Here’s an excerpt from the job description:</p><blockquote><p><em>The Senior Evangelist for IXG (Immersive Experiences Group) role is a leadership position in support of Autodesk’s AR\VR initiatives. We are looking for a highly experienced communicator, capable of giving TED-style talks, to help deliver our AR\VR strategy and initiatives at industry events and to customers, partners or even internal teams.</em><p><em>Your mission will be to understand and evangelize the products, projects and advanced research into AR\VR that is being conducted throughout the company; and to help guide our customers along their journey to AR/VR.</em></p></blockquote><p>The job itself looks super-cool. Here are some more specifics about the responsibilities:</p><strong></strong><p><ul><ul><li><em>Play a part in key events, activities and social platforms around Autodesk’s AR\VR strategy. </em></li><li><em>Collaboratively work with sales teams, technical account managers to visit key customers and lighthouse accounts </em></li><li><em>Build a communication plan for both internal and external evangelism around AR\VR </em></li><li><em>Contribute as a key member of the AR\VR strategy team </em></li><li><em>Inform key product stakeholders including company leadership of current and emerging market trends and representative customer feedback. </em></li><li><em>Identify, create, maintain, and leverage key relationships in target industries to enhance product awareness and adoption. </em></li><li><em>Connect with key industry thought leaders, including industry specialists, research analysts, press, and other influential parties.</em></li></ul></ul><p>If the position wasn’t San Francisco-based and requiring ~50% travel (neither of which appeal to me, right now) I’d probably be throwing my hat into the ring for it. Although I do love my current role, so then again I might not. :-)</p><p>If you’re interested in the role for yourself, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/249955632/" target="_blank">apply today</a>. I’d be happy to refer people I know personally, of course, so do <a href="mailto:kean.walmsley@autodesk.com" target="_blank">drop me an email</a> if we’ve met and you’re considering applying for the position.</p>
