<p>The “call for proposals” for AU2014 is going out on April 23rd and will remain open for about a month. This is approaching quickly, so get your thinking hats on if you’re considering submitting a class proposal.</p>
<p>From my side I’m thinking about a few possible topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Implementing a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangible_user_interface" target="_blank">tangible user interface</a> for AutoCAD using <a href="http://ti.com/sensortag" target="_blank">SensorTag</a></li>
<li>Integrating a web-based user interface into AutoCAD via its JavaScript API</li>
</ul>
<p>I’m also toying around with the idea of doing a kind of “meta” session, during which we’d look at some of my favourite blog posts/areas of research over the years. Something like “8 years of <em>Through the Interface</em>”, possibly including a brief section on the motivations behind the blog and how I manage it.</p>
<p>These are just preliminary thoughts, though. If any of you have any suggestions, I’d really like to hear them – even if you’re not planning on attending the conference in person (anything I prepare for AU tends to make it onto this site first, of course :-).</p>
<p>Please post a comment with your suggestions (bearing in mind I’ll (hopefully) be offline until April 22nd, enjoying travelling around the UK with my family).</p>
