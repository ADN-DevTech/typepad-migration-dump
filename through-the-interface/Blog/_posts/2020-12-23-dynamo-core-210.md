<p>Santa (meaning <a href="https://dynamobim.org/author/sol-amour/">Sol Amour</a>) has left one last Dynamo release under the tree for us all to enjoy over the holidays: <a href="https://dynamobim.org/dynamo-core-2-10-release/">Dynamo Core 2.10</a>. According to Sol’s post there have been a few updates to Node Autocomplete – which <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2020/12/have-you-tried-node-auto-complete-in-dynamo-29.html">I mentioned a few weeks ago</a> – but that we should expect many more to come. And there are other updates that are likely to be of interest in this release, too – check out Sol’s blog post but also the release notes. There are a few new nodes in this release, for instance: AnyTrue, AnyFalse and a Math.Random node that takes a seed parameter for repeatable randomness! :-)</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2026bdeb0187d200c-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="New Random Seed Nodes" border="0" height="230" src="/assets/image_477852.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="New Random Seed Nodes" width="500" /></a></p><p>I probably won’t have time myself to fool around with this over the break, but I hope some of you find it interesting enough to have a quick play. And <a href="https://forum.dynamobim.com/t/request-for-feedback-dynamo-node-autocomplete/57246">if you have feedback on Node Autocomplete, be sure to let the Dynamo team know</a>. Thanks!</p>
