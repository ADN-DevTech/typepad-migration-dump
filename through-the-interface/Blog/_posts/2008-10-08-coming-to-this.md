<p><a href="http://au.autodesk.com/event"><img height="154" alt="Join me at AU 2008!" src="/assets/au08_ask_180x150.jpg" width="184" align="right" border="0" style="BORDER-TOP-WIDTH: 0px; BORDER-LEFT-WIDTH: 0px; BORDER-BOTTOM-WIDTH: 0px; BORDER-RIGHT-WIDTH: 0px" /></a> This year's AU is coming up quickly... as I mentioned in <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2008/07/au-2008-class-s.html">this earlier post</a>, we have a number of sessions lined up for developers, in addition to a wealth of interesting sessions in the Customization &amp; Programming track.</p>

<p>If you'd like to see the various sessions in the Developer track, <a href="http://au.autodesk.com/sessions/?sort=materials&amp;order=ASC&amp;track=Developer&amp;year=2008">click here</a>.</p>

<p>Here are specific links to my three sessions:</p>

<p><a href="http://au.autodesk.com/sessions/detail/2679/">DE311-2 AutoCAD® .NET: Developing for AutoCAD Using F#</a></p>

<p><a href="http://au.autodesk.com/sessions/detail/3099/">DE215-4 There's More to DWG™ than AutoCAD®</a> (handout parts <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2007/10/au-handouts-the.html">1</a>, <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2007/10/au-handouts-t-1.html">2</a> &amp; <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2007/10/au-handouts-t-2.html">3</a>)</p>

<p><a href="http://au.autodesk.com/sessions/detail/3127/">DE301-3 Enrich Your DWF™</a> (handout parts <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2007/10/au-handouts-enr.html">1</a> &amp; <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2007/10/au-handouts-e-1.html">2</a>)</p>

<p>I'll also be participating in this panel session, &quot;DE115-3 AutoCAD® APIs: Meet the Experts&quot;, although for some reason I can't find this session online, right now (I'm looking into why that is).</p>

<p>My co-bloggers <a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2008/10/au-2008.html">Jeremy Tammik</a> and <a href="http://modthemachine.typepad.com/my_weblog/2008/10/autodesk-university.html">Brian Ekins</a> have also posted about the sessions they're delivering.</p>

<p>One important reminder: <strong>if you manage to sign up before October 10th, you'll still be able to receive the $500 &quot;early bird&quot; discount</strong>.</p>

<p>And finally, if you're already coming to AU 2008, be sure to <a href="http://au.autodesk.com/network/groups/profile/Through_the_Interface/">join the &quot;Through the Interface&quot; group on AU Online</a>. I'd very much like to meet with &quot;Through the Interface&quot; readers, so please do drop me an email if you'd like to find some time to meet up!</p>
