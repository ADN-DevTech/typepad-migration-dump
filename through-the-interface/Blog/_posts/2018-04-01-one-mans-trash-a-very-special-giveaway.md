<p>It’s really proving to be <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/one-mans-trash/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a fun series</a>, as we recycle the contents of the <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2017/12/the-end-of-an-era-for-autodesk-switzerland.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">closing Autodesk Neuchatel office</a>. So far we’ve given away a couple of RS-232 <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2018/02/one-mans-trash-an-rs-232-breakout-box.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">breakout</a> <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2018/02/one-mans-trash-another-rs-232-breakout-box-sold.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">boxes</a>, a <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2018/03/one-mans-trash-a-copy-of-the-autodesk-file-signed-by-john-walker.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">signed copy</a> of <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2018/03/one-mans-trash-and-the-winner-is.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Autodesk File</a> and a (so far unclaimed) <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2018/03/one-mans-trash-a-patch-panel-punch-down-tool.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">patch panel punch down tool</a>.</p>
<p>Today we’re offering a very special item to readers of this blog. It’s one of Autodesk Neuchatel’s best-kept secrets – not even all of our local employees know about it – but up on the roof of the building in Puits Godet we have a hot tub. And it’s awesome – a great way to unwind between those late-night conference calls with the West Coast. If hot tubs could talk, this one would have quite a few stories to tell. It’s just as well they don’t, then, I suppose. :-)</p>

<p>Fun as the hot tub is, we really don’t know what to do with it now that the office is closing: we clearly can’t leave it where it is, and none of us is particularly motivated to install it at our home. We asked the Dublin office if they’d like it, but they claimed it wasn’t climate-compatible, whatever that means. We thought it’d be perfect for Barcelona, but they said that employees just popped across the road to the beach to unwind, so there really wasn’t any point. The good news is that this means it’s up for grabs for one of this blog’s readers. Yay!</p>
<p>As usual, all you have to do is to <a href="mailto:kean.walmsley@autodesk.com?subject=I want a hot tub" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">drop me an email</a> expressing your interest in the item. I’m more than happy to take measurements and more detailed photos for you, should you need them, just let me know in the email. The other minor “process change” from the rest of this series is that it’s not really practical to ship this kind of item anywhere in the world at Autodesk’s expense. We can ship it for free within Switzerland and the EU, but if you live outside of this area you’ll need to cover 50% of the shipping costs (we’ll let you know exactly how much that is before you commit).</p>
<p>As it’s quite likely to be a very popular item – but may take some back-and-forth to discuss specifics related to the hot tub and its delivery – I won’t announce the winner immediately, but keep names in a queue until someone commits to taking it. I’ll respond to each email in person to give interested parties an idea of the current status, of course.</p>
<p>Good luck to all those who choose to respond. I hope the lucky winner has as much fun in this baby as we all have had, over the years!</p>
