<p>The ADN team delivered around <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2007/08/autodesk-univer.html" target="_blank">50 classes at AU 2007</a>, and we're currently planning on delivering around the same number at <a href="http://au.autodesk.com/2008" target="_blank">AU 2008</a>.</p>

<p>(A quick note on the classes I'll be delivering: I'm planning to deliver a class on programming AutoCAD with F#, as well as delivering the &quot;<a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2007/10/au-handouts-the.html" target="_blank">There's more to DWG than AutoCAD®</a>&quot; and &quot;<a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2007/10/au-handouts-enr.html" target="_blank">Enriching your DWF™</a>&quot; classes from last year.)</p>

<p>Joseph Wurcher, manager of AU Program Development and author of <a href="http://au.autodesk.com/blogs/BLAUG/" target="_blank">BLAUG</a>, asked me to pass on the below &quot;last call for presenters&quot; to this blog's readership.</p><blockquote><p><em>Two words: submissions deadline. If you’re considering joining our outstanding slate of speakers at Autodesk University 2008, you’ll have to act by <strong>April 27, 2008</strong>.</em></p>

<p><em>Please submit your presentation proposal(s) online, as soon as possible, at the <a href="http://au.autodesk.com/event/speaker_cfp/" target="_blank">Call for Papers website</a>.</em></p>

<p><em>Whenever we stop to analyze why Autodesk University has become so hugely successful, one thing is clear: the excellent presentations from experts&nbsp; are a big, big factor.</em></p>

<p><em>The time for us to assemble the AU 2008 faculty, who are without a doubt the most critical component of the overall AU experience, is nearly over. So if you:</em></p>

<ul><li><em>Have the communication skills, technical expertise, and relevant experience...</em></li>

<li><em>Want to share your knowledge of a favorite topic—from tips and tricks and sales techniques to new business opportunities such as sustainable design...</em></li>

<li><em>Are motivated to bring success to design professionals and their organizations...</em></li>

<li><em>Want to demonstrate your expertise to several thousand Autodesk customers, partners, and employees, thereby promoting your business success...</em></li></ul>

<p><em>... Then we want to hear from you—now!</em></p>

<p><em>A speaker honorarium is also provided.</em></p>

<p><em>Joseph</em></p></blockquote><p>It would be great to see more &quot;Customization &amp; Programming&quot; classes from readers of this blog, for instance. See you in Vegas! :-)</p>
