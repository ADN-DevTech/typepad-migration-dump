<p>I’ve just arrived back from Berlin, which I was primarily visiting for <a href="http://keanw.com/2018/07/just-a-few-weeks-until-the-aec-hackathon-in-berlin.html" target="_blank">this year’s German AEC Hackathon</a> (<a href="http://www.keanw.com/2017/04/the-aec-hackathon-in-munich.html" target="_blank">last year’s was in Munich</a>, which I attended briefly in the weeks leading up to <a href="http://keanw.com/round-the-world" target="_blank">our big trip</a>). I was there with my family, and we had a great time visiting the city when I wasn’t needed at the Hackathon.</p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad3a376f1200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="333" title="Kean looking manic at the AEC Hackathon" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Kean looking manic at the AEC Hackathon" src="/assets/image_950300.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Let’s start with a few tourist shots. On Thursday we visited a few places, such as the Holocaust Memorial…</p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad383ac50200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe" src="/assets/image_769998.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>… and the Berlin Cathedral, which was beautiful inside but had stunning views across the city from its roof.</p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad3a3754a200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="View from the top of Berlin Cathedral" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="View from the top of Berlin Cathedral" src="/assets/image_593918.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad3a37552200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Angels watching the Berlin skyline" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Angels watching the Berlin skyline" src="/assets/image_540529.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>We were staying with an old friend of the family out in Brieselang, so ended up spending quite a bit of time on the local public transport system.</p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad35d9b52200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Train travel in Berlin" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Train travel in Berlin" src="/assets/image_140414.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Berlin is a wonderful city. It has an incredible feel to it: it’s surprisingly green – with trees everywhere, like many German cities – but has a really interesting vibe, too, probably related to its unique place in 20th century history.</p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad35d9b5a200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="194" title="Freedom Berlin" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Freedom Berlin" src="/assets/image_599599.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>I’d last visited Berlin back in 1991, not long after the wall came down. The city has changed quite a bit… we saw a procession of funkily-decorated Trabants driven around the city by Chinese tourists, and Checkpoint Charlie hard morphed into a photo-opportunity worthy of Las Vegas.</p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad3a376c5200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Trabi tours" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Trabi tours" src="/assets/image_758284.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad383b01a200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Checkpoint Charlie" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Checkpoint Charlie" src="/assets/image_552495.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>It’s still an amazing place, though. I’m really happy I had a reason to visit again.</p><p>On Friday, before the Hackathon started, I headed across to Potsdam to meet with colleagues from the InfraWorks team.</p><p>Our office in Potsdam came along with the acquisition of 3D Geo, a spin-off from Postdam University. It’s located very near to the University’s leafy campus. A beautiful, peaceful working environment.</p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad383ac5f200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Autodesk Potsdam" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Autodesk Potsdam" src="/assets/image_996213.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>After a productive meeting I headed into Berlin for Friday lunchtime, as the afternoon had a number of interesting workshops scheduled. </p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad3a376cb200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Arriving by train at the Hackathon" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Arriving by train at the Hackathon" src="/assets/image_803395.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Arriving at the Hackathon I was happy to see my old buddies Damon Hernandez and Greg Howes, who are largely responsible for having launched the first AEC Hackathons back in 2013.</p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad35d9b66200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Kean, Damon and Greg" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Kean, Damon and Greg" src="/assets/image_984503.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>I spent a little time at the Robots in Architecture workshop, taking the chance to catch up with Johannes Braumann.</p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad3a37561200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Robots in Architecture workshop" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Robots in Architecture workshop" src="/assets/image_253144.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Before long, though, I was asked to head over and help out at Jaime Rosales’ sold-out (in fact oversold) Forge workshop. He had 35 (whcih later grew to 40) attendees in a hands-on workshop. Crazy!</p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad383ac67200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Jaime's oversold Forge workshop" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Jaime's oversold Forge workshop" src="/assets/image_348475.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Jaime somehow managed to leave 40 people having gone through the basics of working with Forge. An impressive achievement – he definitely earned a beer or two afterwards.</p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad383b0af200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="375" height="500" title="Jaime sipping a well-deserved beer" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Jaime sipping a well-deserved beer" src="/assets/image_749988.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>After the workshops there were a number of preliminary evening presentations, followed by lightning rounds and team forming. The setting – an old factory that’s now used by TU Berlin – was simply fantastic!</p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad383ac6b200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Evening presentations" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Evening presentations" src="/assets/image_341495.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>I headed back quite late, arriving home at about half-past midnight, but it was well worth it: it had been a fun day.</p><p>On Saturday I managed to get in for the end of breakfast, where newly formed teams were already hacking away.<p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad3a376cf200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Chatting to Christoph Raidl" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Chatting to Christoph Raidl" src="/assets/image_73592.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Later on in the day my family showed up, which was really nice.<a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad3a376d8200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="My family arrives" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="My family arrives" src="/assets/image_183160.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>My kids had a blast posing for a few photos in hard-hats and day-glo vests.</p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad3a37da0200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="375" height="500" title="My younger kids having fun at the AEC Hackathon" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="My younger kids having fun at the AEC Hackathon" src="/assets/image_790747.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Hacking was by this point at full throttle.</p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad383ad98200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Hacking all day" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Hacking all day" src="/assets/image_975116.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>During the course of the day a number of presentations were held.</p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad3a376e9200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Presentations, too" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Presentations, too" src="/assets/image_689020.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Philipp Mueller and other members of the organising committee worked really hard to make sure everything ran smoothly.</p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad383b56e200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="375" height="500" title="Phil Mueller on a chair signalling in semaphore" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Phil Mueller on a chair signalling in semaphore" src="/assets/image_502637.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>One presentation that blew me away was by Long Nguyen, where he talked about the DynaShape project he’d started at last year’s AEC Hackathon in Munich. It’s unbelievable what he’s been able to achieve. A perfect endorsement of the value of these events.</p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad35da3ea200c-pi"><img width="500" height="284" title="DynaShape" style="margin: 30px auto; float: none; display: block;" alt="DynaShape" src="/assets/image_509113.jpg"></a></p><p>I took the stage myself for a while to talk about <a href="http://dasher360.com" target="_blank">Dasher 360</a> and our use of Forge.<a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad3a376f5200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="333" title="Talking Forge at the AEC Hackathon" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Talking Forge at the AEC Hackathon" src="/assets/image_743372.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>During the afternoon I did my best to give guidance to a few different teams, notably Dive (who were doing some cool particle CFD simulation display using Forge), a team from the Uniersity of Stuttgart doing crazy things with bendable materials…</p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad383ada4200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="The awesome team from Stuttgart" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="The awesome team from Stuttgart" src="/assets/image_3705.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad3a37ad3200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="HoloLens hacking" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="HoloLens hacking" src="/assets/image_883608.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>… and a team of Forge newbies from TU Munich called That BIM Pineapples, who wanted to create a colour-swatch importer for the Forge viewer:<a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad383ada2200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="The fun That BIM Pineapples team" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="The fun That BIM Pineapples team" src="/assets/image_668499.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p><p>Sunday morning was mostly about wrapping up the hacking and then creating presentations for the afternoon’s demo session.</p><p>This session was held in a lecture theatre and had strong attendance. I sat at the front next to Peter Schlipf – mainly to take photos of the demos – and somehow ended up being part of the jury.</p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad383ac73200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Sitting with Peter Schlipf during the project demos" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Sitting with Peter Schlipf during the project demos" src="/assets/image_343423.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad3a37578200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="A big crowd" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="A big crowd" src="/assets/image_956977.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>The winners would receive a number of cool prizes, along with fancy gold-painted hard-hats. Woohoo!</p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad383ac77200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Time for the awards" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Time for the awards" src="/assets/image_873649.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>There were 25+ teams, so rather than covering every single (often amazing) project, here are photos of the winners…</p><p>The <strong>best overall project</strong> went to <a href="https://twitter.com/HeinzPfeiffer" target="_blank">Benjamin Felbrich</a> for his <strong>Flexamo</strong> project, where he integrated the NVIDIA Flex realtime physics engine into Dynamo.</p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad3a37711200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Flexamo" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Flexamo" src="/assets/image_666339.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>The <strong>best mashup-up project</strong> went to <strong>5d Rhythm</strong>, who were using Dynamo to automate the painting of road markings by a small, wheeled robot.</p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad35da0df200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="5d Rhythm" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="5d Rhythm" src="/assets/image_167328.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>The <strong>best Dynamo project</strong> went to <strong>Auto.Cooperate</strong>, who focused on the problem of transferring architectural models across to be used for structural analysis.</p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad383adb8200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Auto Cooperate" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Auto Cooperate" src="/assets/image_662830.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>The <strong>best Forge project</strong> went to <strong>Augmented Participative Assembly</strong>, who has clearly done some deep thinking about creating an Assembly Information Model that can be represented both via Forge and (eventually) in AR:</p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad383adb0200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Augmented Participative Assembly" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Augmented Participative Assembly" src="/assets/image_146346.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p><br></p><p>The <strong>best “problem facing the AEC industry” project</strong> was won by <strong>Sensual Concrete</strong>, who actually seemed genuinely to care about concrete’s feelings. And they used Forge to express these feelings.</p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad3a37708200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Sensual Concrete" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Sensual Concrete" src="/assets/image_561792.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p><p><p><p>The <strong>best Maker project</strong> went to one of the teams from the <strong>University of Stuttgart’s Institute of Computational Design</strong> who were creating a really interesting digital twin for high-tech, adaptive materials.</p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad3a37da2200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Digi Twin" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Digi Twin" src="/assets/image_163209.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Last but not least was the <strong>best From Scratch project</strong>, where <strong>That BIM Pineapples</strong> built a prototype app that imported colour swatches via your phone’s camera that could be used to paint geometry within the Forge viewer.</p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad383adaa200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="That BIM Pineapples" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="That BIM Pineapples" src="/assets/image_946468.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>And yes, as mentioned earlier, this is indeed one of the teams I helped when I could… you can see <a href="https://youtu.be/UrD991xFKNU" target="_blank">their full demo presentation on YouTube</a>.</p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad3a3771f200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="OK, so I helped a bit" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="OK, so I helped a bit" src="/assets/image_769540.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>The <strong>best Big Data project</strong> was won by <strong>Geo Spatialist</strong>, who used New York City data to create a predictive model of traffic congestion from air pollution levels. Really cool!</p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad383b6c9200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Geo Spatialist" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Geo Spatialist" src="/assets/image_185430.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>All in all it was a great (but tiring, and I wasn’t even hacking!) weekend. Congratulations to all the winners, but also to everyone who came together for this wonderful event. Thank you for making it so worthwhile.</p><p>On Monday I spent much of the day with my family at the highly-recommended <a href="https://www.berlinstory.de/" target="_blank">Berlin Story Bunker</a>, where we learned a great deal about the rise and fall of the Nazi party and the important role Berlin has played in modern European history. If you ever go to Berlin be sure to take the time to see this – it’s a far cry from the type of experience you’ll get less than a kilometre away at Checkpoint Charlie. It’s a really important exhibition, especially given <a href="https://twitter.com/keanw/status/1021434681714233344" target="_blank">the times we’re all living through</a>.</p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad383b57f200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Berlin Story Bunker" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Berlin Story Bunker" src="/assets/image_158740.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>I’m looking forward to my next visit to this incredible, vibrant city. Thanks to all involved in the AEC Hackathon for giving me and my family the push we needed to visit!</p>
