<p>I haven’t been spending much time, of late, on XR (the convenient abbreviation for AR/VR/MR), but <a href="http://blog.leapmotion.com/mirrorworlds/" target="_blank">this blog post</a> got my attention.</p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad35bebe0200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="282" title="Mirrorworlds" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Mirrorworlds" src="/assets/image_266303.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Our friends at <a href="https://www.leapmotion.com" target="_blank">Leap Motion</a> – the company who created <a href="http://www.keanw.com/2013/01/integrating-leap-motion-and-autocad-review.html" target="_blank">interesting technology for capturing hand gestures</a> and who has, over the last few years, executed a fairly successful pivot to focus on XR – have put together an interesting concept that does a good job of making XR compelling for various scenarios.</p><p>Warning: be careful not to confuse Leap Motion with the once-future-of-mixed-reality-but-now-looking-increasingly-overhyped <a href="https://www.magicleap.com/" target="_blank">Magic Leap</a>… 3+ years ago Magic Leap was hot news with their <a href="http://keanw.com/2015/01/hololens-for-cad.html" target="_blank">cool promotional videos and patent filings</a>, but <a href="https://digg.com/2018/magic-leap-demo-video" target="_blank">this week’s demo videos were underwhelming</a>, especially given the incredible coolness of the previous ones that ending up being <a href="https://www.inverse.com/article/24973-magic-leap-ar-demo-video-faked" target="_blank">smoke and mirrors</a>.</p><p>Leap Motion’s concept is also currently smoke and mirrors, of course, but that’s because it’s directionally indicative rather than a technology unveiling. They call it – appropriately enough – “Mirrorworlds”.</p><p align="center"><br></p><p align="center"><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kTv7aQx09XI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media"></iframe></p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad35bebe0200c-pi" target="_blank"><br></a></p><p>Here’s a video showing how it could apply to our industries:</p><p align="center"><br></p><p align="center"><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QGUhFcRjgus" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media"></iframe></p><p><br></p><p>These kind of alternate, overlapping realities aren’t a new concept – science fiction authors such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vernor_Vinge" target="_blank">Vernor Vinge</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbows_End" target="_blank">Rainbows End</a> had the wonderful concept of belief circles) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_C._Wright_(author)" target="_blank">John C. Wright</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Golden_Oecumene" target="_blank">The Golden Oecumene</a> series went even further into the future to explore the digital-physical divide, with future humans having the ability to project virtual avatars into physical space) have been exploring this area for years – but it’s nice to see this kind of vision being described by a technology provider who might just be able to help make it happen.</p><p>What do you think? Are you inspired by this vision of the future and how it might apply to our industry? If so (or if not) then please post a comment!</p>
