Even if you’re not able to join the event in-person, you’ll be able to participate virtually.</p><p>I am hoping to be able to join this one physically – Copenhagen is such a great city – but I have to see whether it can be made to work with a few other commitments I have that week. Even if I’m not there in person, I will certainly be there in spirit (i.e. online ;-).</p></p>
