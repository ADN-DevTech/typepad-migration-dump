<p>While I’m unlikely to be present for much of next week’s Autodesk University event – all being well I’ll be in Sardinia – I have been feeling the excitement mount ahead of it.</p><p>Mainly from attending the Forge Hackathon, which is now nearing it’s climax. The event kicked off with a really interesting event held via SpatialChat. I hadn’t used it before, but was immediately hooked.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2026bdef515d0200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="394" title="Kicking off the Hackathon via SpatialChat" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Kicking off the Hackathon via SpatialChat" src="/assets/image_722684.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>There were different rooms (fine), but even within a single room you could have private conversations by moving off into a corner. The sound increases as you get closer to a sound source, whether another person, or some music or a YouTube video being played. Yes, I did start a Floppy Friday episode playing just to see how it worked. What was really interesting is how the sound sources merged – if you wanted to listen to the video and some other music at the same time, you could just stand between them.</p><p>Anyway, this week the event’s proceedings have been run via Slack and Zoom. I did monitor the Slack channels, but didn’t see anything that really needed my input. I also joined today’s “coffee break”, to catch up with my colleagues and a couple of Hackers who had questions.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20282e125604a200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="312" title="A quick coffee break" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="A quick coffee break" src="/assets/image_546256.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>I tried my best to “fly the flag” today by sporting the swag sent through by the Forge team – my first Autodesk T-shirt with the new logo!</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2026bdef515d6200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="312" title="My newest Autodesk T-shirt" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="My newest Autodesk T-shirt" src="/assets/image_165464.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>You’ll see it again in tomorrow’s Floppy Friday, if you watch it.</p><p>All in all the event seems to be going well. There are various teams but many have been very quiet, so it’s a little hard to tell how much progress is being made. We’ll see what tomorrow’s demo day brings. I have no doubt there’ll be some fun surprises!</p><p>One last note about next week’s classes – the Forge team have some local language classes that may be of interest to people:</p><ul><li><a href="https://events-platform.autodesk.com/event/autodesk-university-2021/planning/UGxhbm5pbmdfNjcwMjAy" target="_blank">Automation &amp; Jumeaux Numériques pour l‘industrialisation de la construction (SD500073)</a> (French)</li><li><a href="https://events-platform.autodesk.com/event/autodesk-university-2021/planning/UGxhbm5pbmdfNjcwMjMy" target="_blank">Digitaler Zwilling und Automation auf dem Weg zum digitalen Bau (AS500379)</a> (German)</li><li><a href="https://events-platform.autodesk.com/event/autodesk-university-2021/planning/UGxhbm5pbmdfNjcwMTQz" target="_blank">Uso de Forge para la transformación digital en arquitectura y construcción (CS500234)</a> (Spanish)</li></ul><p>Be sure to check one of them out if your preferred language is French, German or Spanish.</p>
