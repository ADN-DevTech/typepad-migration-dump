<p>On Tuesday night my daughter and I headed to Geneva to hop on a plane to Amsterdam Schipol.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202b751aa2659200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Our plane" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Our plane" src="/assets/image_448163.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>We were quite lucky with our arrival: we were able to get out of the airport and onto a train to Delft within 20 minutes.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202b751aa265d200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Catching the train" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Catching the train" src="/assets/image_684686.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>On arriving in Delft we headed to our Airbnb, managing to avoid being hit by bicycles. We came across some interesting structural work being down on a nearby bridge.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202c1b2589cf2200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Some crazy formwork" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Some crazy formwork" src="/assets/image_150091.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>After dropping our bags, we headed out for dinner with my old friend Pete Storey, who kindly popped over from Utrecht to meet us for a bite and a chat.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202c1b2589cf6200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="375" height="500" title="Dinner with Pete" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Dinner with Pete" src="/assets/image_431925.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Some of you may remember that Pete and I worked closely together on the Dar Smart Bridge project: something <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2023/06/checking-whether-your-class-proposals-have-been-accepted-for-autodesk-university-2023.html" target="_blank">we’ll be presenting about at AU 2023</a>.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202b751aa2661200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="After dinner" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="After dinner" src="/assets/image_223019.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>We woke up bright and early to head across to TU Delft’s faculty of architecture. I had totally misjudged the weather: luckily we’d brought an umbrella – and my daughter was smart enough to bring her own rain jacket – so we were more than a little soggy by the time we arrived.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202b751aa2665200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="375" height="500" title="Blown away" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Blown away" src="/assets/image_141050.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>The room was slow to fill up – the weather had a big impact on some people’s travel plans – at least during the introductions.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202b751aa2669200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Introductions" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Introductions" src="/assets/image_271038.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Michela Turin and the rest of the committee have worked very hard to make this event happen, <a href="https://www.caadfutures2023.nl/" target="_blank">the 20th annual CAAD Futures conference</a>.<a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202b751aa2671200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Michela" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Michela" src="/assets/image_59050.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Autodesk is proud to be listed as a sponsor for this year’s CAAD Futures event.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202b751aa267c200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Sponsored by Autodesk" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Sponsored by Autodesk" src="/assets/image_613790.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>I had my mugshot show up briefly as the keynotes and panelists were mentioned.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202c1b2589d02200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Announcing the panel" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Announcing the panel" src="/assets/image_704292.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>The paper sessions then started in earnest: I enjoyed hearing about some work on volumetric sub-division, including a case study on “marching 3d shapes”.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202b751aa2694200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Marching 3D shapes" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Marching 3D shapes" src="/assets/image_998858.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Several presenters joined remotely, which worked quite seamlessly.</p><p><img width="500" height="375" title="Some remote participation" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Some remote participation" src="/assets/image_463952.jpg" border="0"></p><p>I met a few people in-person that I’d previously only been connected to online. This is Alex Walzer, who recently moved across from Zurich to Delft.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202c1a6ccc518200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Kean and Alex" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Kean and Alex" src="/assets/image_437672.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>I’ve spoken a number of times in the past with Davide Schaumann, a long-time collaborator with Autodesk Research.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202c1a6ccc51c200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Kean and Davide" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Kean and Davide" src="/assets/image_77753.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>After lunch there was the first keynote in the orange hall.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202c1a6cccdf8200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="375" height="500" title="The orange hall" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="The orange hall" src="/assets/image_538554.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>This is such a great space for a large talk, despite the high wind posing some challenges with the external blind system (and therefore the screen visibility).</p><p>John Gero – a hero of the architectural design community – gave a fascinating talk about the brain of a designer.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202c1b258a9d0200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="John Gero talking brain scanning" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="John Gero talking brain scanning" src="/assets/image_386415.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>During the afternoon I popped back to the flat to take a couple of meetings and to change for the evening’s talks. These kicked off with another great keynote by Alessandro Bozzon, whose lab at TU Delft is doing some really interesting work that aligns closely with our own efforts.</p><p><img width="500" height="375" title="Allessandro Bozzon's keynote" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Allessandro Bozzon's keynote" src="/assets/image_882615.jpg" border="0"></p><p>It’s quite something having everyone sitting up in the stands.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202c1a6cccddd200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="The audience" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="The audience" src="/assets/image_475899.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>The day ended with talks from five panellists. First was Michela Magas:</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202b751aa3c54200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Michela" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Michela" src="/assets/image_423508.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Followed by Cristiano Ceccato from Zaha Hadid Architects:</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202b751aa3c58200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Cristiano" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Cristiano" src="/assets/image_738130.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Matthew Vola from Arup talked about a number of projects, including one that’s dear to my heart (the MX3D bridge):</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202b751aa3c5c200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Matthew" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Matthew" src="/assets/image_791485.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>I was next, and talked about some of the work we’ve done relating to <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2022/09/human-centric-building-design.html" target="_blank">human-centric building design</a>:</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202b751aa3c64200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="498" height="375" title="Kean" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Kean" src="/assets/image_666886.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>And the last talk of the day was by Thomas Krall from Superworld:</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202c1a6cccded200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Thomas" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Thomas" src="/assets/image_496640.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>By the time we’d finished it was already 9:15pm (a long day!), but we did have time for a very quick panel discussion.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202b751aa3c6c200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="498" height="375" title="The panel" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="The panel" src="/assets/image_296979.jpg" border="0"></a></p><h5>After everything was done, Leon van Berlo from buildingSMART came up to me for a chat. He’d kindly chosen to come across to Delft for the event so we could meet in person. Thanks for making the trip, Leon!</h5><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202c1a6cccdf1200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Kean and Leon" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Kean and Leon" src="/assets/image_655589.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>All in all the first day at CAAD Futures was fantastic. It was a long day – we’d started at 8:15am and had gone through to after 9:30pm – but it was great to engage with so many passionate folk from the architectural design technology community. I’m looking forward the workshop day on Thursday!</p>
