<p>Well, today was the day I printed my first 3D object. The missing feeder tube from our site’s MakerBot Replicator 2 hasn’t yet been replaced, but Francesco Tonioni, friend, colleague and probably the most practical person I know, cobbled something together as a stop-gap.</p>  <p>So the game was on. :-)</p>  <p>This initial project stems back to May of last year – when I was <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2013/06/dunroamin.html" target="_blank">in Boston for our internal Technical Summit</a> – when my son talked to me about an idea of his. My children really like LEGO, and, at the time – the specific product tie-in tends to vary based on the LEGO game they’re working through on the Xbox 360 – they were really into <a href="http://thelordoftherings.lego.com/" target="_blank">The Lord of the Rings LEGO</a>.</p>  <p>My son’s big problem was that when you put the ring into Frodo’s hand, our little plastic ring-bearer didn’t actually become invisible. We tried to propose a clear plastic Hobbit figure via the <a href="http://lego.cuusoo.com" target="_blank">LEGO Cuusoo</a> site, but hit a stumbling block when we needed to submit a photo. Yes, a photo of an invisible Hobbit. ;-)</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201a5117243ad970c-pi" target="_blank"><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 20px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="Frodo with the ring" border="0" alt="Frodo with the ring" src="/assets/image_171835.jpg" width="400" height="305" /></a></p>  <p>So, my first priority when the 3D printer arrived was to print a transparent plastic LEGO minifigure, whether for my son to play with or to help with submitting the concept to LEGO.</p>  <p>I used the OBJ file we saw in <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2012/08/creating-3d-street-art-using-autocad.html" target="_blank">this previous post about creating street art using AutoCAD</a>, loading it into MakerBot’s MakerWare software. Initially I tried laying the model flat, thinking that printing it this way would reduce the need for support material:</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201a3fcc279c0970b-pi" target="_blank"><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 20px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="MakerWare on the case" border="0" alt="MakerWare on the case" src="/assets/image_895937.jpg" width="400" height="318" /></a></p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201a5117243b7970c-pi"><img style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 20px; display: inline; float: right" title="Making LEGO" alt="Making LEGO" align="right" src="/assets/image_779040.jpg" width="192" height="192" /></a>After failing an initial test print, it seemed as though we would get better results by orienting the model upright and removing the support material afterwards. In fact I think the issue ultimately came down to my choice of model: for some reason one of the legs consistently prints with worse quality than the other and one of the arms has a very fragile connection to the torso. <a href="https://grabcad.com/library/lego-minifig" target="_blank">This Inventor model</a> would probably be a better starting point, on reflection.</p>  <p>It was great to see the Replicator 2 in action, in any case. It actually worked more quickly than I expected and the results were pretty decent for a first attempt.</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201a73d7d80b5970d-pi" target="_blank"><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 20px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="Invisible at last" border="0" alt="Invisible at last" src="/assets/image_63398.jpg" width="400" height="305" /></a></p>
