<p>I’m now back from Oslo, and decided to record the demo I delivered there at the end of the Forma Hackathon (or something approximating it, as I used twice as much time as we were each allocated on the day).</p>
<p>Here’s a photo shared by the event organizers of me talking:</p>

<p>Here’s the video I recorded this morning:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"> </p>
<p>As I mentioned at the end of the video, the capabilities I’ve demoed inside this Forma extension could also be implemented using Dynamo for Forma. That’s probably something I’ll blog more about, at some point, if there’s enough interest.</p>
