<p>I’ve been getting quite a bit of unsolicited email of late. It started with this one, in late July:</p><blockquote><p>Hi Kean,<br>Did you know that a QR code of your email address is currently being<br>circulated all around the globe in a viral meme?<br>Cheers,</p></blockquote><p>It came with a couple of images attached:<p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20282e11a22b9200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="469" title="The meme" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="The meme" src="/assets/image_381301.jpg" border="0"></a><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2026bdee9cc27200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="281" title="Scanning a QR code" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Scanning a QR code" src="/assets/image_359766.jpg" border="0"></a><p>Perhaps somewhat rudely I largely ignored it, as I thought it was some elaborate spam or phishing attempt. I did scan the QR codes and found some curious things encoded: my email address, the URL to <a href="https://blogs.autodesk.com" target="_blank">blogs.autodesk.com</a>, my old Autodesk office phone number, the location of said office, my contact information (with the old phone number, thankfully), and a couple of notes with random(ish) text. I wasn’t especially concerned, as it was all information that was either public information or no longer relevant. A bit weird that someone would take the time to encode my information in a meme, but hey. No big deal.<p>But the emails kept coming. What was a bit strange was that several came from people in the Netherlands, the only country I’ve visited in the last year and a half.<p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20282e11a22c7200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="492" title="Dutch meme" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Dutch meme" src="/assets/image_445963.jpg" border="0"></a><p>As far as I could tell, someone was sharing the image as this year’s “vacation photos”, which I assume is funny because people haven’t travelled much during 2021. I still don’t quite get the joke, but I guess the QR codes with a white border look a bit like photos, and the only travel we’ve been doing is digital? If someone can explain better what (if anything) they find entertaining about it, I’d actually really appreciate knowing.<p>I received quite a few “testing” emails, but also a few messages of thanks from people who thought I’d started the meme myself:<blockquote><p>It was great fun receiving the scribbled "photographs" and wondered what they really would reveal.<p>Thank you from The Netherlands.</p></blockquote><p>This one was a bit surreal:<blockquote><p>Kem Kang is shamelessly promoting your business through your Q code icon.</p></blockquote><p>Promoting my business? How dare they!?!</p><p>A few more people sent through versions of it:<p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20282e11a22cf200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="380" title="Another version" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Another version" src="/assets/image_566776.jpg" border="0"></a><p>I even saw it <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6831373828451651585/" target="_blank">shared on LinkedIn</a>:<p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202788041b342200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="323" title="LinkedIn version" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="LinkedIn version" src="/assets/image_431031.jpg" border="0"></a><p>By this point I was starting to wonder how and why someone would target me like this. After chatting about it with my friend Simon Breslav – who really became curious about this whole scenario – I even grilled my 17-year-old son, in case he did it to wind me up (even though I knew he wouldn’t have). Simon was convinced it was by someone I knew; from my side I was less sure.<p>On another call with Simon we started doing a little forensic analysis using Google Image Search to determine when it was first shared (it wasn’t much help, frankly, as it doesn’t always do a great job indexing the ever-shifting sands of social media). At some point during the call I ended up zooming into the image to take a closer look, something I’m now amazed I hadn’t done sooner…<p>The penny finally dropped when I realised the image’s background was AutoCAD’s drawing canvas.<p>“Hold on a minute… QR codes inside AutoCAD? That rings a bell.”<p>A quick search on my blog uncovered <a href="https://keanw.com/2010/09/more-fun-with-qr-codes-encoding-different-types-of-data-inside-autocad.html" target="_blank">a post I’d published 11 years ago</a>, where I’d used a simple tool (which now that I think about it was published as a “<a href="https://www.keanw.com/plugin-of-the-month/" target="_blank">Plugin of the Month</a>”, after <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2010/12/decembers-plugin-of-the-month-live-on-autodesk-labs-qr-codes-for-autocad.html" target="_blank">some enhancements by Augusto</a>) to embed some sample QR codes into an AutoCAD drawing. To show the different capabilities I’d embedded an email address, a URL, a location, some contact details, some notes… you get the picture.<p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2026bdee9cc31200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="436" title="The blog post" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="The blog post" src="/assets/image_197599.jpg" border="0"></a><p>Clearly, for whatever reason, someone had either been searching for an image of QR codes for a meme, or had stumbled across the post (some of my MX3D posts did get shared a lot with people in the Netherlands, after all) and had just decided to create one with it. I don’t even know whether they scanned the codes to see what they contained.<p>Simon did speculate – mainly because neither of us could really understand why people found it in any way amusing – that perhaps the meme was AI-generated. How hard would it be to have a bot auto-generate memes and flood social media with them using fake accounts, just to see what resonated with people? The cost of sending out such memes – like spam emails – would basically be zero, and presumably someone would find a way to derive some financial benefit of seeing stuff go viral. In fact I sometimes wonder whether the memes we see on social media aren’t largely AI-generated.<p>For those of you who are interested, it turns out you can use <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2020/4/29/21241301/meme-generator-imgflip-neural-network-ai" target="_blank">AI to auto-generate versions of existing memes</a> using <a href="https://imgflip.com/ai-meme" target="_blank">this tool</a>. Most are pretty awful, but occasionally they make some vague sense:<p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202788041b346200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="333" title="AI-generated meme" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="AI-generated meme" src="/assets/image_563345.jpg" border="0"></a><p>So that’s my story of how an obscure 11-year-old blog post ended up leading to a “viral” (probably a big word for something seen by some hundreds of people) meme. I hope you enjoyed it more than the meme itself!
