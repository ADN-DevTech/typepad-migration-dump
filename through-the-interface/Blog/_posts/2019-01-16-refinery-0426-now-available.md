<p>A new version of Project Refinery is now available for your generative pleasure via the <a href="http://feedback.autodesk.com" target="_blank">Autodesk Feedback community</a>. It’s a pretty big release – being the first since the <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2018/11/project-refinery-implement-generative-design-workflows-for-aec.html" target="_blank">launch of the public beta at AU 2018</a> – and has some very interesting features.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad3b0edf8200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="312" title="The updated UI" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="The updated UI" src="/assets/image_18372.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p><strong>New Features</strong></p><ul><li>Refinery installer</li><li>New sample files</li><li>10 times faster</li><li>Less computing resources used</li><li>Better initial geometry views</li><li>Smaller geometry storage on disk</li><li>Filtering of designs in parallel coordinates</li><li>Sorting for thumbnail views and table</li><li>Better progress indicators</li><li>Pause and resume for studies</li><li>Refinery Server shutdown occurs automatically on exiting Dynamo</li></ul>
<p><strong>Bug Fixes</strong></p><ul><li>Chinese input names now work correctly</li><li>Fixed error “…does not seem to support WebGL”</li></ul><p>Now a little commentary…</p><p>I’m happy to see the 3D geometry now being compressed to take up <strong>much</strong> less space on your hard-drive, as well as the general speed improvements and better initial geometry views.</p><p>It’s convenient having an installer, but this currently looks for Dynamo 2.0.2 (early versions of Refinery needed a daily build of Dynamo 2.1, which I still had installed, so it did make me move to the latest stable 2.0.2 release). Not a big deal, though: just go ahead and get 2.0.2, if you haven’t already.</p><p>Pause and resume is convenient for long-running tasks, especially if you want to claim back system resources for something time-sensitive (although Refinery seems better at leaving CPU on the table when compared with prior versions I’ve used).</p><p>I also like the parallel coordinate filtering, and here’s how that works: You start with the parallel coordinate view:</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad3b0edfc200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="312" title="Raw" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Raw" src="/assets/image_723879.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>At which point you can window- (or rather crossing-) select across an area of one of the coordinate axes and it will filter to that subset.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad3d08ffb200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="312" title="Filtered" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Filtered" src="/assets/image_950363.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Which you can repeat for other axes, of course:</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad3d09000200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="312" title="Double-filtered" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Double-filtered" src="/assets/image_870896.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>A handy way to reduce the number of solutions you’re working with.</p><p>There were a few changes I had to work through for my various projects…</p><p>I found the Refinery server now binds to localhost by default: this shouldn’t make any difference whatsoever for normal use – in fact it removes an irritating Windows Firewall dialog – but it is an issue for my VR-related work, where we need to access the server from other clients. It seems it’s possible to launch the server manually with the –host option set to 0.0.0.0: this at least works for connecting to the service, which is the main battle.</p><p>I also found I lost the geometry from previous runs when the server was upgraded. This isn’t a huge issue, but it may force you to re-run studies (especially if you’re performing demos with the new version, as I am later this week).</p><p>It’s great to see Project Refinery being moved forward: these are mostly very welcome upgrades to the experience, and I expect things to improve further over the coming months.</p><p>I’m planning on posting a set of steps to get started with Refinery in the next few days: I did talk about this in one of my AU 2018 classes, but I do think it’s worth spelling out in another post.</p>
