<p>I almost thought today’s episode wasn’t going to happen. I started checking the directory listings for a few floppies, and suddenly things started to fail. I couldn’t read any at all, and ended up trying a series of combinations of different computers, floppy drives and cables, all with similar (bad) results. I went back to cleaning the drive heads (once again – this was the first thing I tried) and eventually things started to work in time for me to record the episode. Totally surreal! I can only blame those nasty gremlins who clearly enjoy haunting 1980s equipment.</p>
<p>Anyway, here is <a href="https://youtu.be/v60_MqIrxVA" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the episode in question:</a></p>

<p>We played a number of interesting games, in my opinion: starting with <a href="https://www.c64-wiki.com/wiki/Match_Point" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Match Point</a>, then the classic <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">kung fu fighter</span> Karate game (thanks for the correction, Trevor Gallyot!), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Way_of_the_Exploding_Fist" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Way of the Exploding Fist,</a> followed by a fun game called <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/c64/super-rider" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Super Rider</a> then wrapping up with <a href="https://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=2740" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Typhoon</a>. A pretty decent selection, as far as things go.</p>
<p>Here’s some cover art:</p>
