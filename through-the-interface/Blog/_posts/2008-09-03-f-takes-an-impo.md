<p>This just may be the catalyst I needed to get around to installing Visual Studio 2008: the availability of the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/dsyme/archive/2008/08/29/the-f-september-2008-ctp-is-now-available.aspx">F# September 2008 Community Technology Preview</a>. This takes F# an important step closer to being a full .NET citizen, with the first release delivered by Microsoft's Developer Division (the previous releases having been delivered by Microsoft Research).</p>

<p>It's not required to use VS 2008 with this release of F#, but that's the version that's been targeted for the IDE integration, naturally enough. I've been holding off from installing VS 2008 for some time - mainly as ObjectARX applications still require VS 2005 - but if I had a crystal ball I'm sure it would show VS 2008 somewhere in my near future... :-)</p>

<p>It is, of course, possible to install VS 2008 side-by-side with VS 2005, but also to use it to develop applications based on the .NET API exposed by the various shipping (&amp; supported) versions of AutoCAD.</p>

<p>Now I just have to make some space on my hard-drive... &lt;sigh&gt;</p>
