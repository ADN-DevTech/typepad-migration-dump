<p>If so (or if not but you’re up for doing so) then the Dynamo team would like to hear from you!</p><p>For some background, here’s <a href="https://dynamobim.org/dynamo-core-2-9-release/" target="_blank">the post on Dynamo Core 2.9 that introduces the feature</a>. To enable the feature via Settings –&gt; Experimental –&gt; Enable Node Auto Complete.</p><p>Then you can simple place a node (from the Library or by right-clicking on the canvas) and start to use auto-complete to find nodes to connect by Alt-clicking the input ports. Here’s me creating a small graph to create a polygon, for instance.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2026be42943eb200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="352" title="Node auto complete" style="margin: 30px auto; float: none; display: block;" alt="Node auto complete" src="/assets/image_821850.jpg"></a></p><p>From my cursory inspection it seems a really handy feature for novices and advanced users alike. If you’re interested in providing formal feedback on this to the Dynamo team, please see <a href="https://forum.dynamobim.com/t/request-for-feedback-dynamo-node-autocomplete/57246" target="_blank">this post for some instructions on how to do so</a>. Thanks in advance for your help improving Dynamo!</p>
