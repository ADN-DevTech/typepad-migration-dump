<p>Augusto Gonçalves – from the ADN team based in São Paulo – asked me to post a quick note advertising an upcoming AutoCAD .NET training he’s delivering in <strong>Mexico City</strong> on <strong>September 2-3, 2013</strong>. The class is free to attend and will be delivered in Spanish.</p>  <p>Here’s <a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/autocad/entrenamientos-api-espanol.html" target="_blank">a description of the training class in Spanish</a> and a link to <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/entrena_API" target="_blank">the registration page</a>.</p>
