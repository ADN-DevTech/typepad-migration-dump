If you’d like to speak at this year’s event, <a href="https://aulondon2018.dryfta.com/en/abstract-submission" target="_blank">propose your class now</a>. It’s the second time an Autodesk University has been held in the UK, and by all accounts the first was a great event. This year’s will be once again be held at Tobacco Dock on June 19th and 20th (which is really a lovely time of year to visit London).</p><p>I wasn’t able to attend AU 2017 in Las Vegas (or last year’s AU London, which was held the week before I left on our trip around the world), so I hope I’ll get the chance to be at this one. We’ll see.</p><p>The Forge team is especially interested in our development partners submitting classes about their use of the Forge platform: if you do end up submitting a class proposal, it would be nice if you could <a href="mailto:kean.walmsley@autodesk.com?subject=AU London class proposal" target="_blank">drop me a quick email</a> that I can pass on to them. Thanks!</p>
