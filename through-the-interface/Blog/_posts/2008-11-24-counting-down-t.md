<p>There's just one week to go before <a href="http://au.autodesk.com/event">this year's Autodesk University</a>. If you need more accuracy than this <a href="http://autodesk.blogs.com/between_the_lines/2008/11/countdown-to-autodesk-university-2008.html">Shaan's here to help</a>. :-)</p>

<p>I'm going to be pretty busy with last-minute (well, last-week) preparation for the event, but will try to post the odd item of interest. For those of you who won't be in Vegas for AU 2008, please do keep checking this blog: I expect to keep posting during the course of the week which will hopefully prove to be of interest whether you were able to attend or not.</p>

<p>One month ago <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2008/10/coming-to-au-20.html">I mentioned an AU Unplugged event</a> that my team had proposed. Thanks for all of you who voted: as you can see from <a href="http://au.autodesk.com/blogs/view/Unplugged_Schedule/">the AU Unplugged schedule</a>, the event was accepted. I'm very much looking forward to attending and participating in this event:</p><blockquote><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2" width="426" border="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" width="105"><em>Session name:</em></td>
