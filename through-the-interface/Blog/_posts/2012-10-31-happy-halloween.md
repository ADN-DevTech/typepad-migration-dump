<p>For fun, here’s a quick preview of this year’s Halloween costume (our what-now-seems-to-be-annual Halloween Party is on this coming Saturday, but as it’s the 31st I thought I’d put it on to scare any kids coming to the door).</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2017d3d256b7f970c-pi" target="_blank"><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 20px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="This year&#39;s Halloween costume" border="0" alt="This year&#39;s Halloween costume" src="/assets/image_511286.jpg" width="470" height="563" /></a></p>  <p>I hope those of you on the path of Hurricane Sandy have made it all safely through the “Frankenstorm” and that life returns to normal for you very soon.</p>
