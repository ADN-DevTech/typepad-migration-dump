<p>We’ve reached the end of a much-needed week off up in the mountains. I’ve actually spent a bunch of time fooling around with getting <a href="https://retropie.org.uk/" target="_blank">RetroPie</a> working on a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-400/" target="_blank">Raspberry Pi 400</a> I bought for the kids (ahem). We’ve been having lots of fun playing Zelda on the NES and Super-NES, Sonic on the Megadrive, and Runn ‘n’ Gunn on the C64.</p><p>Before leaving to come up, I did record <a href="https://youtu.be/feNwuzB3G_Y" target="_blank">an additional episode of Floppy Friday</a>, although in fairness no floppy was harmed (or used) in the making of this particular episode: we take a look at three C64 games I have on cartridge. The first, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wizard_of_Wor" target="_blank">Wizard of Wor</a>, came with the <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2020/10/announcing-floppy-fridays.html" target="_blank">original auction bundle that launched this whole adventure</a>, while the other two came in one of the boxes we opened during <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2021/02/floppy-friday-18.html" target="_blank">last week’s Floppy Friday episode</a>: the classic Atari games <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centipede_(video_game)" target="_blank">Centipede</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dig_Dug" target="_blank">Dig Dug</a>.</p><p>To make this a proper Atari episode, I also used another recent purchase: an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_CX40_joystick" target="_blank">Atari CX40 joystick</a> (which is essentially the model that came with with venerable <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_2600" target="_blank">Atari 2600 console</a>, and is the model that inspired the <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2021/01/floppy-friday-12.html" target="_blank">much-worse-engineered Commodore 1311</a>.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2026bdec1d073200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="436" height="450" title="SONY DSC" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="SONY DSC" src="/assets/image_295963.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Here’s this week’s Floppy Friday for you to enjoy. Loading from cartridge is a lot quicker than loading from floppy, so this particular episode is quite a bit shorter than usual.</p><p align="center"><br></p><p align="center"><iframe width="500" height="283" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/feNwuzB3G_Y" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"></iframe></p><p><br></p><p>See you next week!</p>
