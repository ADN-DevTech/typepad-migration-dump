<p>It was a productive 10-day trip to the US: 7 performance reviews (6 delivered, 1 received), many presentations (3 delivered by me, one of which was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pecha_Kucha" target="_blank">Pecha Kucha</a>-style) and probably a dozen or so 1-on-1 meetings with team members, as well as going through the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Birkman" target="_blank">Birkman</a> Method with my direct team and peers. Altogether a great week, just a little grueling.</p>  <p>The schools are out, this week – as the canton of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuchatel" target="_blank">Neuchâtel</a> celebrates its founding on March 1st, every year – so I’m going to spend the next day or so mostly offline with my family, and will probably not be working on anything blog-related.</p>  <p>I will just point out our latest <a href="http://labs.autodesk.com/utilities/ADN_plugins" target="_blank">Plugin of the Month</a>, as <a href="http://labs.blogs.com/its_alive_in_the_lab/2011/02/march-adn-plugin-of-the-month-roomreumbering-for-revit-now-available.html" target="_blank">announced by Scott on his&#160; blog</a>. This month’s plugin is a Room Renumbering app for Revit (so not really very relevant for this blog’s readership, but anyway).</p>  <p>One last final note… on the train back from Geneva I had a slightly surreal experience. The person who’d been sitting opposite me asked – in French, as we approached Neuchâtel station – “are you Kean Walmsley?”. I quickly got paranoid, as he’d been looking at his iPhone and I thought he might be an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_theft" target="_blank">identity thief</a> picking up info from an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio-frequency_identification" target="_blank">RFID</a> in my credit cards (or something sinister like that). It turns out he’d recognised my face because <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/keanw" target="_blank">he follows me on Twitter</a>. This sort of thing often happens at AU – understandably enough – but it’s never happened to me elsewhere (in the “real world” :-) before.</p>
