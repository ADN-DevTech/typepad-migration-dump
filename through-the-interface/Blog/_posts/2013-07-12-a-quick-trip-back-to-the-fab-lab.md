<p>I stopped by <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2013/04/a-fab-lab-opens-its-doors-in-neuchtel.html" target="_blank">the Fab Lab in Neuchâtel</a>, last week, to say a quick hello and find out what’s being worked on. Gaetan Bussy, the Lab manager, spent some time talking to me about some projects they have in the pipeline, one of which is to hack their Ultimaker to make it work with polar rather than (and eventually in addition to) Cartesian coordinates.</p>
<p>Gaetan also showed me the latest addition to the Lab’s equipment, a <a href="http://b9creator.com" target="_blank">B9Creator</a> they received after backing <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/b9creations/b9creator-a-high-resolution-3d-printer" target="_blank">its Kickstarter project</a>. The project was successfully funded (and then some)&#0160;a year ago, so I was quite surprised this is the first I’d heard about it.</p>
<p>It’s a very interesting device: a high resolution 3D printer that makes use of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Light_Processing" target="_blank">DLP</a> projector to harden <a href="http://b9creator.com/product/b9r-1-red-resin-1-kg-2-2-lbs" target="_blank">photo-sensitive polymer resin</a>:</p>

<p>The results look great, and it seems they can be used for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost-wax_casting" target="_blank">lost wax casting</a>, which is obviously of great interest to people making metal jewellery using this technique. Hopefully I’ll get the chance to play around with it, at some point, maybe even to crank out <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2013/07/drawing-a-figure-of-eight-knot-inside-tinkercad-using-javascript.html" target="_blank">a few mathematical knots designed using Tinkercad</a>.</p>
