<p>In this week’s Floppy Friday we take a look at three more games on the Commodore 64: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Dangerous_2">Rick Dangerous 2</a>, <a href="https://www.c64-wiki.de/wiki/The_North_Sea_Inferno">North Sea Inferno</a> and <a href="http://www.gamebase64.com/game.php?id=799&amp;d=24">Black Panther</a>.</p>

<p>I actually recorded this one before the holiday break (which I’m still enjoying with my family up in the mountains), but I have to admit I’m looking forward to being able to record more episodes over the coming weeks.</p>
<p>I’ve been researching what I need to do to fix my “breadbin” C64, and I’m cautiously optimistic I’ll be able to coax it back to life. I also have a C128 to pick up the next time I’m in Bern: another auction lot that comes with more floppies, some joysticks, a (broken) CRT screen and even a dot-matrix printer. I have to admit I’m looking forward to plugging all that in, when I get it. Fun fun fun!</p>
