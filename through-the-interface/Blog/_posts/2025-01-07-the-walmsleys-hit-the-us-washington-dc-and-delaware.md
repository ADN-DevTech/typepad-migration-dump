<p>We&#39;re back from a wonderful two week break in the United States. In this post and the next I&#39;ll share some pictures and talk a little about the experiences we had.</p>
<p>Since much earlier in the year we’d planned on spending the holidays in the US with our son who&#39;s studying for an exchange year in Baltimore. This was well before it became clear that the Alps would be getting the most snow over the holiday period than we&#39;ve seen in the last decade or so. A bit of a shame - we typically enjoy the Swiss slopes at this time of year - but actually we were just fine with it; it turned out to be an unforgettable experience.</p>
<p>It all started on the morning of December 20th, when we took a 7am train towards Zurich airport.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_772298.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Leaving from Zurich." border="0" height="500" src="/assets/image_772298.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Leaving from Zurich" width="375" /></a></p>
<p>Our flight was with United, direct to Dulles airport.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_94646.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Waiting to board." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_94646.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Waiting to board" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>On arrival in Dulles we took the <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2024/08/dc-and-baltimore.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">once-futuristic elevated shuttle</a> to the terminal.</p>
<p>After getting through immigration quite quickly - it really makes a difference leaving on the 11:45am United flight rather than the 12:45pm Swiss one! - we took the shuttle to collect our rental car. We&#39;d booked a BMW X1, but with 5 people, each with backpacks and carry-ons plus a central shared checked suitcase, I was worried about space, so we jumped at the chance to (cheaply) upgrade to an X3. Not a huge increase in capacity, but still - I do believe it made a difference in terms of comfort.</p>
<p>We headed towards the city: we’d booked an Airbnb right near the Capitol. I wish I’d figured out the option to avoid tolls right away with our car’s guidance system - it’s always so hard when you get off a long flight and have to negotiate these things - because the cost of using the EZ-pass transponder provided by the rental company was a little pricey… oh well. We’ll see when the charges hit. With any luck it won’t be anything like the costs we racked up on <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2017/08/sao-paolo-to-paraty.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the drive from Sao Paolo to Paraty</a> during <a href="https://www.keanw.com/round-the-world" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our round-the-world trip</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_216599.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Welcome to DC." border="0" height="500" src="/assets/image_216599.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Welcome to DC" width="375" /></a></p>
<p>I took the above screenshot on my phone just as we entered DC itself, with this photo taken shortly after as we crossed the Potomac river.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_843747.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Crossing the Potomac." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_843747.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Crossing the Potomac" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>I&#39;d been a little concerned about being in the US between the election and inauguration, but it mostly seemed quite subdued. Just the occasional reminder of the political climate on display.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_574936.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_574936.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Bus stop" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Our Airbnb was - as expected - a big room with 5 beds. Which was absolutely fine… our son - the one staying in Baltimore - joined us there and didn’t have jet lag to deal with, so he and I ended up each doing <a href="https://adventofcode.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Advent of Code</a> at different times for these days: he stayed up late while I attacked it a few hours later when the jet lag woke me up.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_795454.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Basic but central." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_795454.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Basic but central" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>The room really was extremely close to the Capitol, so we walked past it whenever we went anywhere.<a href="/assets/image_940482.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Capitol Police." border="0" height="500" src="/assets/image_940482.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Capitol Police" width="375" /></a></p>
<p>It&#39;s really a magnificent building.<a href="/assets/image_675326.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="The Capitol." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_675326.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="The Capitol" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>We ended up taking lots of snaps of it from different locations.<a href="/assets/image_878555.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Through the park." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_878555.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Through the park" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>It was really nice seeing it at different times of day, too.<br /><a href="/assets/image_38555.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Capitol at dusk." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_38555.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Capitol at dusk" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>It was extremely code - a cold front hit just as we arrived in DC - but at least it was sunny and dry. It was nothing compared to the cold front that&#39;s hitting the US right now, by all accounts.<a href="/assets/image_875060.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Walmsleys at the Capitol." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_875060.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Walmsleys at the Capitol" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>We had a lot of fun walking around the city, though, despite the cold. And it was nice not having to rely on a car or public transport while we were there.<a href="/assets/image_339610.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_339610.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Having fun" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>We did come across our first Cybertruck in the wild, which the kids appreciated: I&#39;d seen a few on previous trips Stateside, but none of them parked.<a href="/assets/image_64065.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Our first Cybertruck." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_64065.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Our first Cybertruck" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>We have a collective soft spot for seasonal lattes, so one of our first stops in DC was to a Starbucks.<a href="/assets/image_950573.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Holiday lattes." border="0" height="500" src="/assets/image_950573.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Holiday lattes" width="375" /></a></p>
<p>When we needed food we mostly hit nearby food trucks.<a href="/assets/image_700642.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="A DC food truck." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_700642.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="A DC food truck" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Souvenir T-shirts, hats and hoodies were also available by the truckload, of course.<a href="/assets/image_820989.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="A DC t-shirt truck." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_820989.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="A DC t-shirt truck" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>We were mainly in DC to visit the incredible museums there. Our first stop after Starbucks was the <a href="https://americanindian.si.edu/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">National Museum of the American Indian</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_923469.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="National Museum of the American Indian." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_923469.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="National Museum of the American Indian" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>We liked this one a lot: the architecture was really interesting and I really enjoyed an exhibit of Plains Indian art, which introduced me to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ledger_art" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ledger art</a>. Incidentally this museum&#39;s gift shop was probably the most interesting we went to on this trip.<a href="/assets/image_516354.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_516354.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="The atrium" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Up next were the <a href="https://asia.si.edu" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Asian Art Museum</a> and the <a href="https://www.si.edu/museums/african-art-museum" rel="noopener" target="_blank">African Art Museum</a>, both of which we accessed via the <a href="https://www.si.edu/museums/sackler-gallery" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Sackler Gallery</a>. (It was a little shocking to still see that name on the building, honestly.)</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_440897.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Asian Art Museum." border="0" height="500" src="/assets/image_440897.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Asian Art Museum" width="375" /></a></p>
<p>To wrap up the first day we spent some time in the <a href="https://airandspace.si.edu" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Air &amp; Space Museum</a>.<br /><a href="/assets/image_66248.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Air and Space." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_66248.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Air and Space" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>It was a little disappointing to see renovations meant that large sections of the museum were inaccessible… that said, we knew we&#39;d be visiting the other location of the Air &amp; Space Museum out by Dulles airport - the <a href="https://airandspace.si.edu/visit/udvar-hazy-center" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center</a>, which I&#39;ll talk about in the next post - so we weren&#39;t especially bothered about spending lots of time in the central one.<a href="/assets/image_603359.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Some was closed off." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_603359.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Some was closed off" width="500" /></a>And as we were all quite tired, we ended up mostly drinking tea in the basement cafe.</p>
<p>The following day we spent the morning at the <a href="https://nmaahc.si.edu" rel="noopener" target="_blank">African American History &amp; Culture Museum</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_841720.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Museum of African American History and Culture." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_841720.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Museum of African American History and Culture" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>I really enjoyed the “culture” section of the museum on upper floors, although the whole thing was very interesting.</p>
<p>The afternoon was spent at the incomparable <a href="https://www.si.edu/museums/natural-history-museum" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Natural History Museum</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_201585.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Natural history atrium." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_201585.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Natural history atrium" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>I love visiting this museum: it must be my third visit, over the years.<a href="/assets/image_708275.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_708275.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Megashark" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>The kids did, too, although it has to be said that some of the exhibits are showing their age. Ba-dum, tish.<a href="/assets/image_8967.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_8967.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Dinos" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>On our third day in DC we checked out of the Airbnb and walked across to the <a href="https://www.nga.gov" rel="noopener" target="_blank">National Gallery of Art</a> - another incredible resource for the people of the Unites States (and visitors from around the world).<a href="/assets/image_970608.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="National Gallery." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_970608.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="National Gallery" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>We were the first through the doors at 10am. If I&#39;d known then what I do now, we&#39;d have gone straight to the <a href="https://www.nga.gov/exhibitions/2024/paris-1874-impressionist-moment.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">exhibition on the Impressionists</a>. I later ended up wasting the best part of an hour in a queue for this admittedly really impressive exhibition.<a href="/assets/image_198395.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Entrance hall." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_198395.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Entrance hall" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>The gallery was full of priceless paintings. It was really quite something to see so many iconic works “in the flesh”, such as <a href="https://www.nga.gov/collection/art-object-page.79.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">this self-portrait by Rembrandt</a>.<a href="/assets/image_62114.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" height="500" src="/assets/image_62114.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Rembrandt" width="375" /></a></p>
<p>Around lunchtime we headed out of the city towards the first state of the union, Delaware. A highlight of the drive was crossing the still-really-impressive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chesapeake_Bay_Bridge" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Chesapeake Bay Bridge</a>. Well worth the $2.50 toll plus the $15 transponder fee.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_9811.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Crossing the Chesapeake Bay Bridge." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_9811.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Crossing the Chesapeake Bay Bridge" width="500" /></a>On arriving in Delaware we headed to the Beaches area. We&#39;d booked an Airbnb at the <a href="https://www.seacolony.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Sea Colony</a> community in Bethany Bay. We had a very nice apartment on a lake for the four days we stayed there.<a href="/assets/image_911830.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_911830.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Sea Colony" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>We had views across the water on two sides of the building, which was lovely.<a href="/assets/image_425137.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_425137.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Inside" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Here&#39;s the view from the master bedroom.<a href="/assets/image_69659.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_69659.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="The view" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Still being jet lagged - and doing the last few days of Advent of Code, as we arrived there on December 23rd - we were up before sunrise for several of our mornings there.<a href="/assets/image_560708.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_560708.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="At dawn" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>A wonderful view to start the day.,<a href="/assets/image_807117.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Another one by dawn." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_807117.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Another one by dawn" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Bethany Beach is a very quaint little seaside town. It was off-season, of course, which in my opinion just added to its charm,<a href="/assets/image_760364.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Bethany Beach." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_760364.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Bethany Beach" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>We had a number of windswept walks along the beach,<a href="/assets/image_827044.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_827044.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="The beach" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Not exactly sunbathing weather, but at least we did have the odd ray of sunshine.<a href="/assets/image_39392.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_39392.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="The family" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>One of the main reasons for visiting Delaware was to visit my old friend Mark Webb. He&#39;d suggested it as a possible destination for our mini tour of the area, and - once we&#39;d booked - had very kindly invited us along to join him and his family for a magnificent traditional British Christmas dinner. Yes, we had Yorkshire pudding and even Christmas crackers. A wonderful evening!<a href="/assets/image_487522.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Xmas dinner with Mark." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_487522.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Xmas dinner with Mark" width="500" /></a>We left Delaware on the 27th, heading north to Pennsylvania. We’ll talk about that in the next post.</p>
