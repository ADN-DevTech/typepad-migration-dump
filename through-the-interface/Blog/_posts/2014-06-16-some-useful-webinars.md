<p>Back in May I pre-announced a couple of webinars that I thought to be of interest to readers of this blog. The <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2014/05/reality-computing-updates.html" target="_blank">first</a> was about ReCap, the <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2014/05/autodesk-exchange-apps-webinar.html" target="_blank">second</a> was about posting apps to Autodesk Exchange.</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201a3fd1f1cb9970b-pi" target="_blank"><img title="ReCap webinar series" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 30px auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="ReCap webinar series" src="/assets/image_397803.jpg" width="394" height="232" /></a></p>  <p>The ReCap webinar was actually the beginning of series: at the time of writing five have now taken place (<a href="http://recapsupport.typepad.com/blog/webinars.html" target="_blank">recordings are available for the first four</a>) and two are remaining. Tomorrow’s webinar on “<em>Capturing 3D reality data by flying a camera on a UAV”</em> looks very interesting: after eventually managing to catch up with <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2014/06/mountains-and-moocs.html" target="_blank">the edX class I signed up for</a> on “navigation for autonomous flying robots”, this is an area I’m especially interested in. I’m actually hoping to automate the navigation piece of capturing a house with a UAV, but we’ll see how far I get with that. :-)</p>  <p>The Autodesk Exchange webinar has been <a href="http://youtu.be/UmMjH8DycP4" target="_blank">posted to YouTube</a>, but here it is, in case you’d rather watch it in-place:</p>  <br /><iframe height="264" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/UmMjH8DycP4?rel=0" frameborder="0" width="470" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>  <br />  <br />  <p>Jeremy points out some important takeaways from the presentation <a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2014/05/exchange-apps-webinar-recording-and-resources.html" target="_blank">on his blog</a>.</p>  <p>A few tidbits that I feel are really worth emphasizing are that you can now make use of <strong>an online entitlement API</strong> to help <a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/cloud_and_mobile/2014/03/how-to-protect-my-intellectual-property-of-my-app-on-autodesk-exchange-part-1.html" target="_blank">secure</a> <a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/cloud_and_mobile/2014/04/how-to-protect-my-intellectual-property-of-my-app-on-autodesk-exchange-part-2.html" target="_blank">your</a> <a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/cloud_and_mobile/2014/05/how-to-protect-my-intellectual-property-of-my-app-on-autodesk-exchange-part-3.html" target="_blank">application</a>. This is a key piece of capability that we often get asked about, and it’s great to know that there’s now something official in place.</p>  <p>It’s also worth noting the ability to set up <a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/cloud_and_mobile/2014/02/how-autodesk-exchange-ipn-listener-works-and-how-to-create-an-ipn-listener.html" target="_blank">a listener for when people pay for your app via PayPal</a>. Hopefully it comes with a handy “ker-ching!” sound (just kidding ;-).</p>  <p>For more information on these, I do suggest watching the recording and checking out the more complete information Jeremy has posted.</p>
