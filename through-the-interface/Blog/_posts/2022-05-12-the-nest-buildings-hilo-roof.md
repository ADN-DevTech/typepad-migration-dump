<p>This week I was supposed to be back in Zurich for a couple of days, visiting <a href="https://www.empa.ch/web/nest" target="_blank">the NEST building</a> on Tuesday and the ETH campus on Wednesday. As it was, though, I managed to pick up Covid at <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2022/05/techx-2022-in-atlanta.html" target="_blank">last week’s TechX event in Atlanta</a>, so I ended up staying at home feeling sorry for myself.</p><p>I haven’t had particularly bad symptoms, thankfully: neither headaches nor fever, just mainly a heavy cough and a bit of brain fog, both of which are thankfully clearing up now. Given the value of last week’s event I’d certainly say that getting it relatively mildly for a few days later was “worth it”, at least with the benefit of 20-20 hindsight.</p><p>It did mean I had to skip this week’s events, though. Luckily my colleague Marta Bouchard from our sustainability team was able to go along and shared some snaps she took for me to post on this blog.</p><p>The NEST building – which many of you will recognise either <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2022/02/the-nest-exhibit-at-the-new-autodesk-gallery.html" target="_blank">from the Autodesk Gallery</a> or as being the main demo model available inside <a href="https://dasher360.com" target="_blank">Dasher</a> – is largely the same as the last time I visited, although the <a href="https://www.empa.ch/web/nest/hilo" target="_blank">HiLo</a> roof at the top right of the below picture is now complete and open. You can see the Hilo unit at various stages of construction in <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2019/08/nest-and-eth-zurich.html" target="_blank">these</a> <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2019/09/the-first-bim-360-community-event-in-switzerland.html" target="_blank">three</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.keanw.com/2020/01/visiting-nest-with-kingspan.html" target="_blank">posts</a>.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20278807c853f200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="The NEST building" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="The NEST building" src="/assets/image_181942.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>When Marta shared this picture of the steps going through the NEST atrium, I couldn’t help but be reminded of our work with <a href="https://keanw.com/VASA" target="_blank">VASA</a>, which we’ve used to calculate many <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2021/10/streamlines-in-the-forge-viewer.html" target="_blank">paths up these stairs</a>.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20278807c84c2200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="375" height="500" title="Interior space" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Interior space" src="/assets/image_190227.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>I’ve probably shared this sign before, but it’s always nice to be reminded of what HiLo stands for: “High Performance, Low Emissions”.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20278807c848f200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="So that's what HiLo stands for" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="So that's what HiLo stands for" src="/assets/image_943228.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>The visit included a presentation by Dr Philipp Block. I’ve <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2016/03/back-to-ethz-to-visit-the-block-research-group.html" target="_blank">met with Dr Block and his team</a> – the Block Research Group (BRG) – a number of times, in the past, and would definitely have liked to have seen this presentation in person.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20282e1550c08200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="375" height="500" title="Some stats presented by Dr Philippe Block" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Some stats presented by Dr Philippe Block" src="/assets/image_365758.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/FTToismPgQk" target="_blank">This video from Empa</a> provides some useful background information about the design and construction of this innovative roof:</p><p align="left"><br></p><p align="center"><iframe width="500" height="283" title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FTToismPgQk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"></iframe></p><p><br></p><p>Here are some shots showing some of the roof’s details:</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20282e1550c0a200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="375" height="500" title="The roof" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="The roof" src="/assets/image_10454.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202942faa3a37200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="375" height="500" title="A nice shot" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="A nice shot" src="/assets/image_657440.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20282e1550c14200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="375" height="500" title="From the stairs" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="From the stairs" src="/assets/image_928380.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Here’s a quick animation that gives a sense of the structure:</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20282e1550c65200b-pi"><img width="281" height="500" title="HiLo" style="margin: 30px auto; float: none; display: block;" alt="HiLo" src="/assets/image_609252.jpg"></a></p><p>The mezzanine floors have great views across the surrounding area.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20282e1550c00200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Looking outwards" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Looking outwards" src="/assets/image_996507.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>I could absolutely see myself working in a space like this!</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20278807c84b0200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="On the mezzanine" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="On the mezzanine" src="/assets/image_581481.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>A huge thank you to Marta for taking these photos and allowing me to share this via this blog. I hope we’ll be able to visit the NEST building together in person soon, Marta!</p>
