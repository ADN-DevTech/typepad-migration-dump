<p>This mini-series of posts relates to my trip over the weekend to Venice for the opening of the 2025 Biennale. I took so many photos that I’ve decided to split it into three parts. The first being about my trip across to Venice with the second two focusing on the Biennale itself. My main purpose for visiting Venice was to attend the last in-person session of the <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2025/02/a-course-on-neuroscience-and-design-at-polidesign.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Neuroscience and Design</a> class I&#39;ve been attending.</p>
<p>On Thursday afternoon of last week I took the train to Zurich, while doing my best to participate in the course’s last virtual session. I dropped my suitcase off at an airport hotel and then headed back into town to attend a concert by <a href="https://www.stereophonics.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Stereophonics</a>, one of my favourite bands.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_255746.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Stereophonics at X-TRA in Zurich." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_255746.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Stereophonics at X-TRA in Zurich" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>It was a great concert - I really enjoyed it a lot. Afterwards I headed back to the hotel to catch a few hours of sleep before an early flight out to Venice. (It ended up being much cheaper to stay in Zürich than to stay an additional night in Venice... I imagine the Biennale hasn&#39;t helped keep local hotel prices down).</p>
<p>Bright and early the next morning I took the tram a few stops to the airport.<a href="/assets/image_725222.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Tram to ZRH." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_725222.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Tram to ZRH" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>It was the first time I&#39;d come to the airport by tram - and used this entrance - so it was interesting to see an overview of an airport I’ve navigated many, many times from below.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_657665.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Zurich airport from the top." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_657665.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Zurich airport from the top" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>For once I didn&#39;t need to reverse a selfie image (as it has naturally reversed the text on the outside of the building). Although I probably should have rotated this one by a few degrees.<a href="/assets/image_818367.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Me ready to fly." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_818367.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Me ready to fly" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>The short flight to Venice was operated by Air Baltic.<a href="/assets/image_865527.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Operated by Air Baltic." border="0" height="500" src="/assets/image_865527.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Operated by Air Baltic" width="375" /></a></p>
<p>On the plane I met <a href="https://fcl.ethz.ch/people/Module-Lead/ChristophHoelscher.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Christoph Hölscher</a> - a professor of Cognitive Science at ETH Zürich and the head of the Future Cities Laboratory - who also happened to be attending the class with me. We decided to take a water taxi into the center of Venice together.<a href="/assets/image_154663.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Water taxi to the city." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_154663.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Water taxi to the city" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>It was actually a bit longer than either of us had expected to get into Venice this way, but it was fun and very scenic.<a href="/assets/image_635692.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Kean and Christoph." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_635692.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Kean and Christoph" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Arriving at the Guglie ferry stop we headed towards the railway station.<a href="/assets/image_61979.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_61979.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Sisters" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>It was a nice opportunity to chat with Christoph - we&#39;ve connected by Zoom a few times since first meeting in Milan at the course&#39;s kick-off session - as I really appreciate the work his lab is doing.<a href="/assets/image_239593.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Walking through the city." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_239593.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Walking through the city" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>There were signs for the Biennale everywhere in the city.<a href="/assets/image_825726.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Lots of signs for the Biennale." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_825726.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Lots of signs for the Biennale" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>By chance - although I did know about it in advance - a member of my team, Marco Fiocco, was visiting from Singapore. Marco grew up near Venice, so was a great local guide.</p>
<p>He introduced me to Venetian canapés - called “cicchetti” - and a spritz made with Select rather than Aperol.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_193603.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Marco and Kean." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_193603.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Marco and Kean" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>The presentation of the cicchetti on the table next to us was really beautiful.<a href="/assets/image_241712.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Local delicacies." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_241712.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Local delicacies" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>For dessert, Marco took me to a gelateria called Venchi - part of what&#39;s now a large chain, apparently.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_661094.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_661094.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Venchi" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Their ice cream was <strong>really</strong> good. I had “Azteca” - made from 85% cocoa dark chocolate - and extra virgin olive oil flavours. They were both good, but the olive oil one was something really different (and delicious).<a href="/assets/image_136673.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Olive oil ice cream." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_136673.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Olive oil ice cream" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Walking in Venice can be really challenging with luggage. I was very happy to have Marco helping navigate, as there are lots of bridges to take and you can easily end up in a spot where you have to take a boat (more on this in the next few posts… I really missed Marco on Saturday!).</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_991717.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Getting those steps in." border="0" height="500" src="/assets/image_991717.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Getting those steps in" width="375" /></a></p>
<p>There were some lovely sights to be seen, along the way. I love the fact a group of teenagers is taking a selfie on the next bridge along.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_231674.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_231674.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Gondala" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>On the way Marco showed me some local pastries through a bakery window. They have different shapes for the same basic biscuit: the <a href="https://www.isoladiburano.it/en/bussola.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">bussolà</a> is the donut shaped version while the essi are s-shaped (like the river going past).<a href="/assets/image_774408.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_774408.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Pastries" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Marco kindly got me all the way to the hotel, which was just off St Mark’s Square and had a real old-school elegance.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_921673.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="The Hotel Concordia." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_921673.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="The Hotel Concordia" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>It even had proper keys and pigeon holes for messages!</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_37677.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_37677.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Keys" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>I had to wait an hour for the room to be ready, so popped across to St Mark’s Square.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_252677.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="St Mark&#39;s Square." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_252677.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="St Mark&#39;s Square" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Here&#39;s a view from the square into an alleyway that leads to my hotel.<a href="/assets/image_690156.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="View through from the square." border="0" height="500" src="/assets/image_690156.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="View through from the square" width="375" /></a></p>
<p>On my way to meet members of the POLI.design class, I snapped some photos of a gondola park.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_710365.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_710365.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Gondolas.gif" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>I’m really happy I had the chance to connect with my fellow students from the course. Most of them have a formal background in architecture, so over the weeks my questions must have been a bit strange to many of them. But we share a passion for making sure more buildings are designed with their occupants in mind.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_204481.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Meeting my fellow students." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_204481.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Meeting my fellow students" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>I left the table a little early to head across to an MIT party being held at the Palazzo Diedo.<a href="/assets/image_680179.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="The venue for the MIT party." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_680179.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="The venue for the MIT party" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>I started by heading up to the first floor, where various projects were on display. Here&#39;s one relating to the use of natural elements as structural support.<a href="/assets/image_747985.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="An exhibit of natural structure." border="0" height="500" src="/assets/image_747985.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="An exhibit of natural structure.jpg" width="375" /></a></p>
<p>I headed back down to the ground floor quite soon, to meet with <a href="https://dusp.mit.edu/people/fabio-duarte" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Fábio Duarte</a> from the Senseable Cities Lab. I really enjoyed getting to talk to Fábio - we couldn’t get back up to the first floor, as there was a massive queue of people wanting to head up - but actually I didn&#39;t mind, at all. We had a lot of fun chatting.<a href="/assets/image_513195.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Downstairs at the party." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_513195.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Downstairs at the party" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>By the time I left the party I was really ready for food. <a href="/assets/image_434481.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Walking back." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_434481.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Walking back" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>I took a few snaps of the canals by night before finding a restaurant for a quick plate of pasta.<a href="/assets/image_5597.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_5597.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Scenic" width="500" /></a>I’ll talk about my time at the Biennale itself in the next post.</p>
