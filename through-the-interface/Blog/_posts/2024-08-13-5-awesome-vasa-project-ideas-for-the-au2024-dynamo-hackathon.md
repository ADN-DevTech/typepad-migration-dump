<p><em>[My apologies for the click-baity title. I do actually have a list of 5 cool project ideas, if you scroll down the post. So it’s not completely dishonest, at least.]</em></p>
<p>In the last post I mentioned <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2024/08/sign-up-for-au2024-classes-today-here-are-some-suggestions.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a few classes you can sign up for</a> (and that I’m directly or indirectly involved in) from the Tuesday to Thursday of the AU2024 week (October 15th-17th) in San Diego.</p>
<p>I now have something to recommend for the Monday of that week, too! In the past we’ve often had pre-events at AU2024: I wasn’t sure whether there would be one this year or not, so I tentatively planned on arriving on the Sunday night, on October 13th. Coming from Europe I usually need one full day on Pacific time before being in shape to present, so in the worst case I’d have walked bleary-eyed around the San Diego waterfront on the Monday.</p>
<p>So I was really happy to see <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7224964769114460162/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">my old friend Sol Amour post on LinkedIn</a> about a Dynamo Hackathon on the Monday preceding AU2024.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_269678.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Dynamo Hackathon at AU 2024." border="0" src="/assets/image_269678.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Dynamo Hackathon at AU 2024" width="100%" /></a></p>
<p>I signed up right away, as these events are always a lot of fun. I’m really hoping that I can convince a team (or more than one!) to make use of the <a href="https://keanw.com/VASA" rel="noopener" target="_blank">VASA</a> package for Dynamo to implement some interesting spatial analyses in Forma, Civil 3D or Revit (whether in traditional or Generative Design workflows). Here are some interesting possibilities that you might implement using VASA during the Hackathon:</p>
<ul>
<li>Determine the <strong>shortest 3D path</strong> - avoiding elevators in the case of a fire - out of a building modeled in Revit</li>
<li>Check how <strong>visible</strong> the shoreline is from the windows of a waterfront building modeled in Forma</li>
<li>Create a spatial metric that estimates how an outdoor public space might encourage <strong>community gatherings</strong></li>
<li>Assess how <strong>accessible</strong> a terrain is for wheeled vehicles in Civil 3D</li>
<li>Detect <strong>clashes</strong> or <strong>gaps</strong> between 3D objects existing in the same coordinate space</li>
</ul>
<p>I admit I’m not yet sure whether I’ll end up joining a specific team - or mentoring a number of them - but I’m very much looking forward to this event. Spaces are filling up quickly (from what I can tell we’ve hit the 50% mark on sign-ups, give or take) so please don’t delay and <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeO1L9olCuFQd5QbjPCYLppVGxGDcus4I-wpQh3u7l4RHBT6w/viewform" rel="noopener" target="_blank">sign up today</a>. Hopefully you’ll be motivated to use it as an opportunity to learn how voxelization can be used to develop compelling spatial analysis workflows with Dynamo!</p>
