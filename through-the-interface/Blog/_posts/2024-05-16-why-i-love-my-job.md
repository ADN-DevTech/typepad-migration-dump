<p>A quick post today to shamelessly plug the company I&#39;ve spent so much of my life working for, and more specifically for the organization where I’ve worked most recently, Autodesk Research. This video was compiled from - among other footage - interviews done at <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2023/11/au-2023-day-3.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Autodesk University 2023</a>.</p>
<p>It also happens to include quite a bit of footage for the <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2023/10/more-information-on-from-steps-to-stories.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">From Steps to Stories</a> exhibit we created in partnership with <a href="https://thebentway.ca/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Bentway</a>.</p>
