<p>It looked like the perfect trip across to AU: the train connection was good, so even though I had a 9am flight from Geneva to Newark I could leave my house at 6am and still make it (even after dinner at friends' the night before, but that's another story). The flight itself went well: I'd managed to snag a bulkhead seat - the first row in economy - and had an empty seat next to me. I even slept for a few hours, which is really rare for me on a flight. I got off the plane really quickly, got through US Immigration amazingly quickly (waiting for all of about 5 minutes) and my bag was literally the first to come out at baggage claim. All of which almost never happens, at least not to me.</p>

<p>Now my luck has unfortunately started to unravel: after rechecking my bag for Las Vegas, I find out that my 4 hour layover has been extended to 5, and then (most recently) nearly 6 hours, because of &quot;Weather&quot; here in Newark. I'm crossing my fingers I'll get into Vegas tonight...</p>
