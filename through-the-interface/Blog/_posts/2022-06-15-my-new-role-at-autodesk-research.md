It does worry me that this may well be the shape of things to come, but I’m also hopeful it’s just a short-term blip, and that I’ll find a way to get back on the blogging horse before too long.</p><p>Basically, within the Autodesk Research organisation we’re some way through a significant shift in the way we perform research, focusing on larger, more audacious – and ultimately more impactful – research goals rather than having a more piecemeal research approach with lots of smaller projects.</p><p>This has brought about quite a few changes, including many for me, personally: I’ve been asked to join one of our eight high-level research areas as its Research Lead. I’ll talk more about the specifics of this new role in due course, but for now I can share that the research area we’ll be focused on will almost certainly bring together various technologies that I and my close colleagues have been working with, over the last few years: generative design using spatial analysis, digital twins for real-world performance data capture and visualization, and advanced computer vision techniques for anonymization and behaviour analysis. It’s going to be a really interesting journey, and one that I hope will have a significant impact on the industry.</p><p>I’ll share more about this at some point in the (hopefully near) future. For now I’ll do my best to keep this blog active with topics that are of interest to people, until that time comes!</p>
