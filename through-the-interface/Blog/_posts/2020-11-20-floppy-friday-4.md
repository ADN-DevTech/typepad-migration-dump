<p>I wasn’t sure I’d find the time to record this week’s episode – what with <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/autodesk-university" target="_blank">Autodesk University 2020</a> being in full swing – but I also thought it might be a nice way to wind down after a hectic week. I hope all of you who attended this year’s AU found it useful (and even fun!) despite the constraints imposed by it being fully online. I’ll post something about how I personally think it went on Monday.</p><p>Anyway, <a href="https://youtu.be/3Gz1LBU0KnY" target="_blank">this week’s Floppy Friday</a> starts with a Star Trek graphic and theme tune, and then looks at a number of games found on a single floppy: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule_Man_%28video_game%29" target="_blank">Molecule Man</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highway_Encounter" target="_blank">Highway Encounter</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paperboy_%28video_game%29" target="_blank">Paperboy</a>. I also give an honorable mention to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweevo%27s_World" target="_blank">Sweevo’s World</a> – although I don’t know how much honor is conveyed by me referring to it as Greebo’s World… I must have Star Wars on the brain after being thoroughly inspired by <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/autodesk-university/ja/class/Modeling-STAR-WARS-46caitesararimankarazhuanzhishitaribenrennotiaozhan-2020#video" target="_blank">this amazing AU 2020 talk by Masa Narita</a>.</p><p align="center"><br></p><p align="center"><iframe width="500" height="283" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3Gz1LBU0KnY" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"></iframe></p><p><br></p><p>Thanks again to Gavin Crump and Clint Brown for the feedback and suggestions. If anyone has thoughts on this series, please share them! I’m maintaining a growing list of “play it if I find it (and if it loads)” games, so feel free to suggest titles.</p>
