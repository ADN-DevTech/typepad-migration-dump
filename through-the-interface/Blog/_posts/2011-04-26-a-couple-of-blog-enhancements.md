<p>I’ve made added a few new features to this blog over the last few weeks, to help people find related content and to get content in their preferred language.</p>  <p>At the bottom of each post – both on the individual posts and the index pages – you’ll find a set of thumbnails delivered by <a href="http://linkwithin.com" target="_blank">LinkWithin</a> which link – hopefully, at least – to related posts on this blog. Going by the number of people using them to access additional content on the blog, it seems to be of benefit to some readers, at least.</p>  <p>I’ve also just integrated <a href="http://www.microsofttranslator.com/widget" target="_blank">a translation widget from Microsoft</a> in the left-sash (as it’s too wide to fit on the right). If you need to copy &amp; paste code, I still very much recommend using the original page: I haven’t yet added custom tags to tell the translator to ignore code blocks (and I’m not sure I can easily do so, retroactively, in any case).</p>  <p>Hopefully both tools will be of use to people: if you have feedback, either way (such as “the LinkWithin choices aren’t very relevant”, “the quality of the translation into Turkish is poor”, etc.) please do post a comment.</p>
