<p>I’m on the train to Zurich airport, where I’ll hop on the direct flight to San Francisco. This evening I’m staying in San Jose, as tomorrow I’ll be visiting the <a href="http://svvr.com" target="_blank">SVVR 2015</a> expo hall to do some research on the latest virtual reality technologies in advance of the coming weekend’s <a href="http://vrhackathon.com/san-francisco.html" target="_blank">VR Hackathon</a> (following on from <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2014/10/gearing-up-for-the-vr-hackathon.html" target="_blank">the one</a> in <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2014/10/vr-hackathon-2014-in-sf.html" target="_blank">October</a>).</p>  <br /> <center> <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b7c78c1c8e970b-pi" target="_blank"><img title="VR Hackathon" alt="VR Hackathon" src="/assets/image_805623.jpg" width="470" height="251" /></a>  </center>  <br />  <br />  <p>This Hackathon is set to be <u>really</u> fun: while last time I ended up mostly talking with people about Autodesk and the <a href="http://developer.autodesk.com" target="_blank">View &amp; Data API</a>, demoing the Google Cardboard prototype I put together – which was also fun, especially when you’re hanging out with Jim Quanci – this time we’re planning to form an Autodesk team to participate in the event. A couple of colleagues from the InfraWorks team in Potsdam are flying in today, too, and we’ll hopefully be joined by a few locals from the 1 Market office who are interested in web-based VR.</p>  <p>The thinking, right now, is to work on some kind of guided VR experience, where you have one person immersed in a model with another person choosing certain options – whether isolating/exploding geometry or switching to specific locations in a site. This could end up being a really interesting application of VR for our industry: as I’ve lamented, in the past, control is often challenging within VR. Sensing technology – such as Kinect or Leap Motion – is certainly one answer, just as voice recognition technology might be another, but having someone else guide the experience will (I believe) lead to a much more social and – dare I say – intimate experience. Something that could really help in a situation where human relationships are important.</p>  <p>Anyway, we’ll see how it goes – it’ll certainly be fun to explore the possibilities. I expect the weekend to be fairly intense: interestingly Monday is a holiday both in the US (Memorial Day) and in Switzerland (Pentecost), so I’ll be get to decompress for a day before heading back home on Tuesday evening.</p>
