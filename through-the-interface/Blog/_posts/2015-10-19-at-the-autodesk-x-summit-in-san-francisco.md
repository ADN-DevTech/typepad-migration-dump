The event is targeted on User eXperience (UX), but is being attended by a very diverse set of Autodesk employees. It’s the first such summit since <a href="http://www.fastcodesign.com/3046354/design-moves/autodesk-hires-facebooks-director-of-product-design" target="_blank">Maria Giudice joined the company from Facebook</a>, which many of us hope (believe!) will usher in a new era for our products.</p>  <p>I’ll be presenting a session on Wednesday regarding my experiments around UX for VR, particularly with respect to <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2014/10/creating-a-stereoscopic-viewer-for-google-cardboard-using-the-autodesk-360-viewer-part-3.html" target="_blank">my View &amp; Data API samples for Google Cardboard</a>, culminating in a widescale demo of <a href="http://vrok.it">Vrok-It</a>. Should be a lot of fun!</p>
