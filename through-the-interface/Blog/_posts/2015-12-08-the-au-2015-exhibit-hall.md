<p>As mentioned in <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2015/12/the-au-2015-blogger-social.html" target="_blank">the last post</a>, although I’d visited the Exhibit Hall at <a href="http://au.autodesk.com/las-vegas/overview" target="_blank">Autodesk University</a> a couple of times during the prior days, it was really on Thursday that I spent the most time there.</p>
<p>One of the highlights, for me, was in the hall leading to the Exhibition Hall itself: the AU Hive. This is the project I’d been introduced to when <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2015/10/a-quick-trip-to-the-octo-robotics-lab-on-pier-9.html" target="_blank">visiting the Applied Research Lab on Pier 9</a>. It was an interesting experiment in how humans and robots – coordinated by a “controlling intelligence” – could achieve more together than they could separately: to build a structure – designed using <a href="http://dynamobim.org" target="_blank">Dynamo</a> – comprising 224 unique pieces, each of which needed custom assembly by both man and bot.<a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b7c7f69a4b970b-pi" target="_blank"><img style="background-image: none; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 50px auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;" title="Robots building the Hive" src="/assets/image_198620.jpg" alt="Robots building the Hive" width="504" height="286" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Over the course of the event, humans put in 67 man-hours to complete the structure. I really liked the fact AU attendees could track the progress in real-time via an option in the AU 2015 app many of us had installed on our smartphones:</p>

<p>The final, 224th piece was built by <a href="http://twitter.com/amarhanspal" target="_blank">Amar Hanspal</a> (human) and Chappie-bot (robot).</p>

<p>Here’s me checking out the completed structure from the inside:</p>

<p>In the Exhibit Hall proper I spent most of my time engaging with visitors to the AutoCAD booth. There was a really nice activity to gather feedback on where to spend our development efforts: AutoCAD users were given LEGO bricks – coloured according to their industry segment – which they could place in the focus areas of most interest to them. Here’s a sequence of shots of Mike Mizuno, AutoCAD Product Manager, capturing the state of the structure using <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2015/04/first-impressions-of-the-faro-freestyle3d-scanner.html" target="_blank">a Freestyle3D scanner</a> borrowed from the FARO booth. You can see the height of the “Anytime, Anywhere” flag!</p>

<p>Away from the AutoCAD booth there was, of course, plenty to see. With the shift in the manufacturing industry – and Autodesk’s business – you inevitably couldn’t go far before tripping over a 3D printer, a CNC mill, or something made by either one or the other.</p>
<p>A crowd-pleaser was <a href="http://makrshakr.com/en" target="_blank">Makr Shakr</a> from Italy: robotic barmen (barbots?) that mixed cocktails ordered via an tablet. My first order – a “Fusion Fizz” – was a) boring to watch, as it was stirred, not shaken and b) tasted awful.</p>

<p>I’m fundamentally an optimist, when it comes to technology, so I wasn’t easily deterred. Assuming the second cocktail was destined to taste bad, too, I chose a cocktail where at least everything would be shaken, to make for a more fun video. Here’s a quick animation of my “The Future of Making Things” being shaken.</p>
<p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201bb089ad412970d-pi"><img style="float: none; margin: 50px auto; display: block;" title="MakrShakr shaking" src="/assets/image_405747.jpg" alt="MakrShakr shaking" width="500" height="281" /></a></p>
<p>If anything this cocktail was way worse than the first – what did I expect from a concoction containing both tequila and Blue Curaçao? – but at least the video was fun. And I have to believe it was my choice of cocktail – and perhaps the recipes needing some work, although apparently I could also have tried inventing my own – rather than it being due to a technological problem.</p>
<p>An interesting moment for me was before the hall opened properly on Thursday… one of the Makr Shakr humans was cleaning up before the robot was due to start its work. I seriously hope that wasn’t a vision of the future! (As a side note, the closing session kicked off with a video version of <a href="http://www.theonion.com/article/secretary-labor-assures-nation-there-still-plenty--51263" target="_blank">this Onion News Network article</a>… at least someone’s keeping a sense of humour about all this. :-)</p>
