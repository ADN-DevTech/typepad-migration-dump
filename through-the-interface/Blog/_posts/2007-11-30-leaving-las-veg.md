<p>I'm sat here at McCarran airport, tapping in a quick post before flying off to Boston. I didn't get the chance to post on the happenings this week at AU (or about anything much else, for that matter), but many others have, so I expect that's OK.</p>

<p>I have to say I really enjoyed this year’s AU, even if I’m now feeling a little frazzled. It was a real pleasure to put so many faces to names over the course of the week, as well as to catch up with old acquaintances.</p>

<p>I'd also like to say a quick (but big) &quot;thank you&quot; to all the presenters and attendees who made the <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2007/08/autodesk-univer.html">Developer Track</a> at this year's Autodesk University such a success. Early feedback indicates the sessions were generally very well received, and I know my team certainly enjoyed the opportunity to present and to engage in so many interesting discussions. I fully expect us to run a Developer Track of a similar (or greater) scale at AU 2008, with appropriate tweaks/enhancements based on the feedback we receive.</p>

<p>If any of you have input on what we might improve for next year, please post a comment or send me an email.</p>

<p>Thank you very much (said in my best Elvis voice, of course). </p>
