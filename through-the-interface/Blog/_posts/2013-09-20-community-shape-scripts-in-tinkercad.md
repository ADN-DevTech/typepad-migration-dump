<p>The <a href="https://tinkercad.com/" target="_blank">Tinkercad</a> team have been busy enabling an interesting new capability in their product called <a href="http://blog.tinkercad.com/2013/08/27/community-shape-scripts/" target="_blank">Community Shape Scripts</a>. As <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2013/07/drawing-a-figure-of-eight-knot-inside-tinkercad-using-javascript.html" target="_blank">I’ve mentioned before</a>, for some time it’s been possible to make Shape Scripts public for other Tinkercad users to inspect and learn from, but now it’s even easier to share – and to discover – interesting Shape Scripts.</p>
<p>You still need to select the “Share Code&#39;” option inside the script’s properties – if you want to share the implementation details with the community – then once you have the Shape Script just as you want it to be shared, simply click the “Publish to Community” button:</p>
<p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2019aff2f9f05970c-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="Sharing a Shape Script with the community" border="0" height="342" src="/assets/image_887477.jpg" style="background-image: none; margin: 20px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="Sharing a Shape Script with the community" width="470" /></a></p>
<p>To see what’s been submitted by other Tinkercad users around the world, expand the “Community Shape Scripts” panel in the right-sash:</p>
<p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2019aff2f9f24970c-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="The Community Shape Scripts panel" border="0" height="342" src="/assets/image_825854.jpg" style="background-image: none; margin: 20px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="The Community Shape Scripts panel" width="470" /></a></p>
<p>I checked the day after (they may well have been available sooner than that), and – sure enough – my Shape Scripts had made it onto the list:</p>
<p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2019aff35290c970d-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="My Shape Scripts in the community list" border="0" height="447" src="/assets/image_419182.jpg" style="background-image: none; margin: 20px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" title="My Shape Scripts in the community list" width="470" /></a></p>
<p>Cool stuff. Now it’s even easier to find interesting Tinkercad Shape Scripts and understand how others have created them.</p>
