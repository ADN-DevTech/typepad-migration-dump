<p>Well this is exciting: it’s now possible to <a href="https://events.autodesk.com/flow/autodesk/devcon25emea/mainevent/page/home" rel="noopener" target="_blank">register for this year’s Autodesk DevCon</a>. It’s being held in Amsterdam from May 20th-21st and is the only Autodesk DevCon event being organized in 2025. (There will be APS-related content at Autodesk University 2025 in Nashville, of course.)</p>
<p>I mentioned the DevCon - and the personal significance of it being held in Amsterdam - back <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2024/10/submit-your-autodesk-devcon-europe-2025-class-proposals.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">during the CFP process</a>.</p>

<p>The venue is the historic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beurs_van_Berlage" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Beurs van Berlage</a> which dates from the end of the 19th century. Amsterdam is actually <a href="https://www.beursgeschiedenis.nl/en/the-story/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the cradle of modern securities trading</a>, with the Dutch East India Company having its IPO - and effectively founding the first modern stock exchange - in 1602. It was at a different location, but still.</p>
<p>There is a modest cost to attend the DevCon and it&#39;s even cheaper if you register before March 7th: you can save 50% or more if you register in the coming weeks. Super early bird pricing is at 50% of the regular price, but there’s also a “buy 5, get 1 free” offer for groups. Plus an additional discount for members of the Autodesk Developer Network.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://events.autodesk.com/flow/autodesk/devcon25emea/mainevent/page/agenda" rel="noopener" target="_blank">agenda is online</a>, too, in case you need convincing of the value of attending. There are some great classes listed - it should be a fantastic event.</p>
<p>I did submit a class - related to the use of WebAssembly to create performant browser-based extensions (for say Forma or Tandem) from existing C++ codebases - but it’s currently waitlisted. Which clearly means the quality of the content must be *exceptional*. :-) Whether I end up presenting or not, I do expect to be there for this year’s DevCon.</p>
<p>I was chatting about the DevCon with Peter Schlipf, who was visiting Switzerland this week. During his visit we took the opportunity to check in on our old friends at Hurni Engineering in la Chaux-de-Fonds and discuss Autodesk Platform Services.</p>

<p>I don’t do this kind of visit very often, these days, and I really enjoy engaging with our partners when I get the chance. Thanks to Pascal and Xavier for hosting us!</p>
<p><em><strong>Update:</strong></em></p>
<p>It looks as though my class is off the waitlist for this event, so I will 100% be in Amsterdam for the conference and even presenting. Yay!</p>
