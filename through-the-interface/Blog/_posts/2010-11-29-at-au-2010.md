<p>It was a bit of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_English_words_of_Yiddish_origin" target="_blank">schlep</a>, but I got here.</p>  <p>My flight out of Geneva was delayed due to inclement weather: the first (actually quite mild) snowstorm of the season. The runway was closed for some time and there was a 1+-hour backlog on de-icing, so I sat helplessly watching my connection time in Heathrow dissipate to nothing. In the end, after a 3-hour delay, this initial flight arrived 5 minutes after my direct connection to Las Vegas had left. I had the choice of waiting a full 24-hours – as BA fly once a day direct to Las Vegas from Heathrow – or jumping on a slightly shorter flight to New York and staying overnight in an airport hotel.</p>  <p>That was my only real choice, as I had commitments – including a recording session for <a href="http://au.autodesk.com/?nd=event_au_virtual" target="_blank">AU Virtual</a> – on Sunday afternoon in Las Vegas. As the Newark-bound plane had been sitting at Heathrow in near-zero temperatures for a few days, it also needed de-icing, as apparently it was <a href="http://aircrafticing.grc.nasa.gov/resources/glossary.html" target="_blank">cold-soaked</a>, but the delay was minor.</p>  <p>I grabbed a few hours of sleep at the Wyndham Garden Hotel, near Newark airport, before heading to catch my 7:30am flight to <a href="http://www.mccarran.com/" target="_blank">McCarran</a>. Another few hours of sleep on the plane, before getting in to Las Vegas and heading across to the Mandalay Bay.</p>  <p>So yes, I made it to the recording of my <a href="http://labs.autodesk.com/utilities/ADN_plugins" target="_blank">Plugin of the Month</a> introduction for AUv on time, but the travel and the dry hotel air had taken its toll on my airways. I very nearly lost my voice towards the end of the presentation, but managed to make it through to the end after a few sips (more like gulps) of water.</p>  <p>For those of you attending the session, I hope it doesn’t mar your experience too badly. Please do ask your questions during the session – I’ll of course be online to answer them.</p>  <p>And for those of you attending AU in person, please don’t be shy about coming up and saying hello. :-)</p>
