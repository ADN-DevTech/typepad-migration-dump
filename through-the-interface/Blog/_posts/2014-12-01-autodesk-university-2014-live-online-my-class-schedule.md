<p>Even if you weren’t able to make it across to Las Vegas for AU, this week, then you can still attend the opening keynote, innovation forums, closing session and a number of key classes via <a href="http://au.autodesk.com/au-online/live-stream">live streaming video</a>. Apparently an additional 200+ classes will be recorded for AU Online, but I don’t know which – if any – of mine will be.</p>
<p>Here are links to <a href="https://events.au.autodesk.com/connect/speakerDetail.ww?PERSON_ID=ACC4FBA25433F6699D2EE603444B9E1F">the events/sessions in which I’m participating</a> in some way, should you want to check out the posted handouts, samples and presentations. I’ve put them in chronological order, so people lucky enough to be here in Las Vegas will know a few places at which they can track me down during the [pre-]conference. :-)</p>
