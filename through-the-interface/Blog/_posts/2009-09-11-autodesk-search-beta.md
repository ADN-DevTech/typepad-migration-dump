<p>As <a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2009/08/autodesk-search-beta.html">Jeremy Tammik reported</a> a few weeks ago, <a href="http://searchbeta.autodesk.com/">Autodesk Search Beta</a> is now available.</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20120a563b83c970b-pi"><img style="border-right-width: 0px; margin: 0px 10px 0px 20px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" title="Autodesk Search Beta vanity search" border="0" alt="Autodesk Search Beta vanity search" align="right" src="/assets/image_604422.jpg" width="258" height="231" /></a>Here are the results of my quick “vanity search” on this site… this isn’t really <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egosurfing">egosurfing</a> in its purist sense (although I admit I do Google my name pretty regularly – just to see who’s quoting my blog :-), it’s more about making sure that this blog is being indexed. Honest.</p>  <p>Sure enough, a number of posts on this site came up in the results, which is encouraging.</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20120a563b84f970b-pi"><img style="border-right-width: 0px; margin: 10px 20px 0px 10px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" title="AutoCAD vanity search" border="0" alt="AutoCAD vanity search" align="left" src="/assets/image_706983.jpg" width="217" height="289" /></a> </p>  <p>On a somewhat related note, I’ve been waiting for some time for our blogs to be indexed and available “in-product”, such as via AutoCAD’s built-in search feature.</p>  <p>Interestingly, it does appear that this blog has now been indexed via the in-product search, as I see the most recent post in the list. That’s cool.</p>  <p>I’m not sure why it says “Did you mean MEAN?” when provided my name, though. I’ve been trying much harder, lately! ;-)</p>
