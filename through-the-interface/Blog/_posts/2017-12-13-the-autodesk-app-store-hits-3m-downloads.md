While this is clearly something that people have to decide for themselves, the numbers are certainly indicating it’s valuable: the App Store team tells me they’ve just hit the “3,000,000 downloads” mark (and may by now have also hit the “3,000 apps” mark, too). For many developers this is proving to be a very valuable mechanism for reaching Autodesk customers around the world.</p>
<p>If you’re interested in learning more about the benefits of the App Store, take a look at Jim Quanci’s recent Forge DevCon class, entitled “<a href="http://au.autodesk.com/au-online/classes-on-demand/class-catalog/classes/year-2017/forge/sd123414" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Use the Autodesk App Store to reach millions of Autodesk customers</a>”.</p>
