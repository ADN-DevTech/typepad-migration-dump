<p>While at Autodesk University 2018 in Las Vegas, my friend and co-presenter – <a href="https://twitter.com/LorenzoVillaggi" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Lorenzo Villaggi</a> – and I were invited by <a href="https://twitter.com/ThatBIMGirl" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Jacqueline Rohrmann</a> – known to many of you as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7L-NLe8FUBJAKrZi2tIWlQ" rel="noopener" target="_blank">That BIM Girl</a> – to talk to her (and her YouTube viewers) about generative design, and specifically the tool we helped create for Van Wijnen to perform generative urban design.</p>

<p>I first met Jacqueline at the <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2018/07/aec-hackathon-berlin-2018.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">AEC Hackathon in Berlin</a>, back in July: she was part of a team – That BIM Pineapples – that I mentored. I met her again <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2018/10/forge-devcon-europe.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">in Darmstadt at the Forge DevCon</a>, when she gave a fun presentation over dinner about her first steps with the Forge platform (culminating in her team winning a prize at the Berlin hackathon).</p>
<p>It was a lot of fun catching up again with Jacqueline in Las Vegas, both at Shaan Hurley’s blogger/social media event and during the interview itself.</p>
<p>Here’s the video:</p>

<p>Many thanks to Jacqueline for inviting us to speak!</p>
<p>Tomorrow morning I’m heading off to Ireland for the first time to meeting with a customer in Dublin and to visit our new office there. (Yes, I know it’s crazy that it’s my first visit, but I haven’t lived in the UK for many years and I somehow never took the time/had the chance to go while I did live there.) As Guinness is my favourite beer I’m really looking forward to tasting one (or perhaps two) in a pub in Dublin. Sláinte!</p>
