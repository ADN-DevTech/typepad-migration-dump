<p>As mentioned in <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2008/08/autodesk-api-te.html">this previous post</a>, my team delivers regular webcasts on programming with Autodesk technologies.</p>

<p>Assuming you're reading this while the metaphorical ink's still damp, it's still not too late to <a href="http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/item?id=10417086&amp;siteID=123112&amp;cname=AutoCAD:%20.NET%20for%20LISP%20Programmers,%20Webcast,%20Oct%2016%202008,%204010">register</a> for a class being held on Thursday October 16th at 8am Pacific, 5pm CET: <em>AutoCAD: .NET for LISP Programmers</em>.</p>

<p>Otherwise you should be able to find a recording of the webcast on <a href="http://www.adskconsulting.com/adn/cs/api_course_sched.php">this page</a> within a few weeks of the session being delivered. In fact, <a href="http://download.autodesk.com/media/adn/NET%20for%20LISP.zip">here</a>'s the recording of the last time this session was delivered (although it may well have been updated slightly, as the session will also be <a href="http://au.autodesk.com/sessions/detail/2672/">delivered at AU 2008</a>).</p>

<p>Here's a brief synopsis of the topic covered by this webcast:</p><blockquote><p><em>You know that .NET is a modern and powerful programming environment. But, no matter how much you might want to start using it, you can't abandon all your old LISP code. We’ll show you how to write .NET code that can interoperate with your existing LISP code, with a special emphasis on user interface components.</em></p></blockquote>
