<p>Today’s my birthday, which I’m spending with a fairly intense work schedule here in Singapore. My family gave me my present early on Saturday night, before I flew out on Sunday morning. To my absolute delight, it’s a <a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/product/1d4d/" target="_blank">Stormtrooper onesy</a>, which I suspect is going to soon become my preferred <a href="http://acronyms.thefreedictionary.com/Working+from+home" target="_blank">WFH</a> uniform.</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b8d100daf2970c-pi" target="_blank"><img title="Stormtooper Kean" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 20px auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="Stormtooper Kean" src="/assets/image_974210.jpg" width="370" height="546" /></a></p>  <p>There’s a reason I’m looking so happy.

Which I have no doubt says something very important about my personality. When I finally get around to getting psychoanalysed, I’ll be sure to let you know what they say.</p>  <p>And so it turns out I’ve also found one possible <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrases_from_The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy#Answer_to_the_Ultimate_Question_of_Life.2C_the_Universe.2C_and_Everything_.2842.29" target="_blank">Ultimate Question of of Life, the Universe and Everything</a>: the age at which you should strive to fulfill your remaining childhood dreams. Surely not a bad goal to aim for! :-)</p>
