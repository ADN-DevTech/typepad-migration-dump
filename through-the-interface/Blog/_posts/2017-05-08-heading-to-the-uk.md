<p>I’m writing this on a train to Geneva airport from where I’ll hop across to the UK for a week. This afternoon I have a meeting in London at the British Library, after which I’ll be checking into the Hilton London Metropole where Autodesk is holding its 9th (at least I think that’s right, if the first was – as I seem to recall – in 2009) annual Technical Summit. This is the internal meeting where technical staff from around the world get together to share information and learn from each other.<a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201bb09990357970d-pi" target="_blank"><img title="Westminster" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 30px auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="Westminster" src="/assets/image_769767.jpg" width="500" height="333"></a></p> <p>Every year the percentage of presentation proposals selected is smaller, mainly due to the fact that every year there are more proposals submitted (this year there were more than a thousand!) for a fairly similar number of presentation slots. I submitted two – one about using Forge to implement Dasher 360, the second about developing for HoloLens – and only the second ended up being accepted. If I’d been able to choose, I would have preferred it being the first, but at least I’m getting to present (the best way to guarantee attendance, of course). It’s always a great event: I know I’ll come home with my head spinning with ideas, as well as having connected with people from various corners of the company.</p> <p>Things are going to be quite busy for the remainder of May and June: aside from this week’s trip, I’m heading to Milan on June 6th for the day to talk about HoloLens and Forge at <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Khronos-Milano-Chapter/events/239567820" target="_blank">a VR meetup at Microsoft House</a>, and the week after that I’ll be in Barcelona for the Autodesk Football Tournament and another <a href="http://autodeskcloudaccelerator.com/forge-accelerator" target="_blank">Forge Accelerator</a>. I submitted two proposals for AU London, but neither was accepted, something I’m rather relieved about now: I can really do without the additional trip, as the week after that – on July 2nd – my family starts its <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2017/03/flights-are-booked.html" target="_blank">big round-the-world trip</a>. Which is both exciting and scary. In many ways, we’re ready – we have our shots, most of our visas and some of the logistics sorted out – but there’s still lots to be done. Especially as on the professional front things are really starting to take off with Dasher 360 – more on this in an upcoming post – and I want to be able to have things move forward when I’m potentially disconnected for days at a time.</p> <p>I’ll do my best to keep posting regularly through the period leading up to our trip’s beginning, although admittedly it’s been hard to keep up my regular pace in recent weeks. I expect to have lots to share for the second half of the year, at least!</p> <p><font color="#666666">photo credit: peterjcoughlan </font><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/125912004@N02/33920168702"><font color="#666666">Westminster</font></a><font color="#666666"> via </font><a href="http://photopin.com"><font color="#666666">photopin</font></a><font color="#666666"> </font><a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/"><font color="#666666">(license)</font></a></p>
