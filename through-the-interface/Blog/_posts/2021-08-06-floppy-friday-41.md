<p><a href="https://www.keanw.com/2021/07/floppy-friday-40.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Last week I mentioned</a> that this week we’d be continuing on the sporting theme, in honour of the Tokyo Olympics. In addition to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indoor_Sports" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Indoor Sports</a> compilation I’d found, I came across <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Games_(video_game)" rel="noopener" target="_blank">World Games</a>, which is the first set of games we tried in this week’s episode.</p>

<p>Here’s the cover art for this week’s games:</p>

<p>It seems World Games was well received – here’s <a href="http://www.zzap64.co.uk/cgi-bin/displaypage.pl?issue=019&amp;page=020&amp;thumbstart=0&amp;magazine=zzap" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a glowing review from issue 19 of Zzap!64 magazine</a>:</p>

<p>I’ll probably switch away from sports for next week, as people will probably be happy for a break by then.</p>
