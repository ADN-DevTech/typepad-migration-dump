<p>Today is a national holiday in Switzerland: the <a href="http://genevalunch.com/2008/09/22/autumn-arrives-with-jeune-federal/">Jeûne Fédéral</a>, or national fasting day (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeûne_genevois">here is some related information</a>), although I have to admit I haven't done anything of the sort. In fact I may just have done the complete opposite. Oh well.</p>

<p>I didn't get the chance to put together a technical post for today, but did want to share a book I'm re-reading, 15 years after I first read it, and getting on for 30 years since it was written. This book is an incredible piece of literature, and is certainly the geekiest (in a good way) Pulitzer-winner I've read: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gödel,_Escher,_Bach">Gödel, Escher, Bach: an Eternal Golden Braid</a> by Douglas Hofstadter. I have another couple of Hofstadter's books on my bookshelf and have promised myself I would work my way through them over the coming months. Anyone who has any interest in cognitive science or artificial intelligence (or simply finds <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/fractals">fractals</a> cool) will lap this one up, I'm sure.</p>

<p>I won't get into an exhaustive book review - I don't feel qualified to attempt it, in fact I feel incredibly humbled just reading it - but I recommend looking it up on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Godel-Escher-Bach-Eternal-Golden/dp/0465026567">Amazon</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gödel,_Escher,_Bach">Wikipedia</a>, to see what others think about it. I'm a huge fan, that much I can say for certain.</p>
