<p>It’s been a really interesting and productive few days here in Tel Aviv. In a sense it was too short a trip – I was penned in by commitments during the weekends either side of it – but despite that a lot was achieved. I didn’t get to see very much of the city – apart from <a href="http://www.atlas.co.il/melody-hotel-tel-aviv" target="_blank">the hotel</a>, <a href="http://www.herbertsamuel.co.il" target="_blank">a restaurant</a>, some nice lunchtime eateries and <a href="http://matepub.co.il" target="_blank">a bar</a> or <a href="https://www.google.co.il/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CCcQFjAA&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fpages%2FRosa-Parks-Bar%2F151168795057140&amp;ei=KvDYUrDCPIKxtAbSm4HgAQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNEr1sUw9GNTVXXgf4JrCTf4HkHddw" target="_blank">two</a> – but I’ll definitely try to come for longer, next time around.</p>  <p>After arriving on Tuesday and meeting with the people I’d be working most closely with during the course of the week, I presented an AutoCAD + Kinect session for the office here. It was very well attended – pretty much everyone in the office came along, which meant about 50 or so people – which I appreciated a lot. I’d received a special request to demo both Kinect v1 and v2 which was a first for me (especially as the combined kit needed – both devices plus my “mobile” HP EliteBook workstation – added significantly to the small amount of luggage I’d otherwise have needed for a short trip like this).</p>  <p>Here’s a view of a point cloud plus extruded solids captured during the course of the session using Kinect v2:</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2019b04e223b1970d-pi" target="_blank"><img title="Kinect extrusion in Tel Aviv" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 20px auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="Kinect extrusion in Tel Aviv" src="/assets/image_109196.jpg" width="454" height="386" /></a></p>  <p>It was a great way to meet the staff in Tel Aviv. Afterwards the real work started, though.</p>  <p>Aside from working with members of the AutoCAD 360 team, I spent quite a bit of time on Wednesday and Thursday with Eyal Nir and Ben Raziel, the main people behind <a href="http://shapeshifter.io" target="_blank">ShapeShifter</a>. A fun proof-of-concept was seeing whether it was possible to use the new JavaScript API to integrate a web property such as ShapeShifter – as well as the JavaScript-based geometry engine it relies upon – into AutoCAD.</p>  <p>To give you an idea of what ended up being possible, here’s <a href="http://shapeshifter.io/#/share/MSAyIDM5IDIuMTMgMC41OCAxIDMuMjQgMy4wMiA5LjQzIDEgNjg4IDAgMCAwLjUwIDAgMCAwLjUwIDAgMCAwLjUwIDAgMCA0IDEuNzUgMS45MiAwIDMgMCAjYTk3YWZmIDM0" target="_blank">a fairly complex, randomly-generated ShapeShifter model</a> using the new revolution topology:</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2019b04e2244c970d-pi" target="_blank"><img title="Tentaculus in ShapeShifter" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 20px auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="Tentaculus in ShapeShifter" src="/assets/image_102917.jpg" width="454" height="301" /></a></p>  <p>This is actually a mesh with ~100K faces. Here’s what it looks like when brought into AutoCAD (which I did by using a customized version of ShapeShifter to send data via AutoCAD’s command-line to a C# command that then generated a SubDMesh: a crude but effective proof-of-concept).</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201a3fc55ccd5970b-pi" target="_blank"><img title="Tentaculus in AutoCAD" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 20px auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="Tentaculus in AutoCAD" src="/assets/image_769537.jpg" width="404" height="279" /></a></p>  <p>It’s unclear where the opportunity is here from a customer perspective, but it certainly demonstrates some interesting possibilities. I’d love to hear from people who have played with ShapeShifter and are genuinely interested in a geometry pipeline between it and AutoCAD (which might well motivate us to take this beyond an internal prototype).</p>  <p>A big thank you to the whole team in Tel Aviv for the warm welcome, especially to Benny Bauer, Ron Meldiner, Eitan Tsarfati, Tomer Galon, and of course Eyal &amp; Ben. I really had a fantastic time. And thanks, once again, to Etti Gazit for the logistical support: I managed to get through Ben Gurion airport security in record time and am now sitting watching it rain from the roof (the weather this week has otherwise been perfect, incidentally ;-).</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201a511054cbd970c-pi" target="_blank"><img title="Rain in Ben Gurion International" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 20px auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="Rain in Ben Gurion International" src="/assets/image_736452.jpg" width="349" height="500" /></a></p>
