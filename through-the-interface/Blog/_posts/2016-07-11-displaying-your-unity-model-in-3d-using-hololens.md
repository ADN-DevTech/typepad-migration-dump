<p>This post shows something really simple, but I decided to share it here as it took me some time to track down.</p> <p>On Saturday I received the 3D model of an ABB industrial robot – the <a href="http://new.abb.com/products/robotics/industrial-robots/irb-6620" target="_blank">IRB 6620</a> I mentioned <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2016/07/my-first-hololens-application.html" target="_blank">last week</a> – from Tom Eriksson. He’s used a number of tools – including Fusion 360 – to create a gorgeous rendition of this particular robot in Unity. Tom very kindly agreed to share the model, and has spent quite a bit of time helping get it ready for HoloLens.</p> <p>The first version Tom sent unfortunately didn’t work for my purposes, as it contained something Mac-specific, due to his use of Cheetah 3D. Tom then exported to FBX and sent an updated version of the project. As this was a standard Unity project I had to do some work to get it showing correctly in HoloLens.</p> <p>My initial attempts led to a planar view onto the model:</p> <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201bb091d883f970d-pi" target="_blank"><img title="Our robot model in 2D" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 30px auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="Our robot model in 2D" src="/assets/image_131334.jpg" width="504" height="341"></a></p> <p>It was clear I was missing a setting, somewhere, and I eventually managed to find out what it was. Beyond the standard settings shown in the majority of tutorial <a href="http://pterneas.com/2016/04/04/getting-started-hololens-unity3d/" target="_blank">blog posts</a>, there’s a “player setting” for the Windows Store app target that <a href="https://abhijitjana.net/2016/04/21/developing-holographic-apps-with-unity-3d-and-microsoft-hololens/" target="_blank">you need to check</a>: “Virtual Reality Supported”. </p> <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b8d203deea970c-pi" target="_blank"><img title="Unity screenshot" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 30px auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="Unity screenshot" src="/assets/image_302900.jpg" width="504" height="285"></a></p> <p>You can then build in Unity and build/deploy in Visual Studio, and the model should display magically in HoloLens in glorious 3D:</p> <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b8d203def5970c-pi" target="_blank"><img title="And now in 3D" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 30px auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="And now in 3D" src="/assets/image_18971.jpg" width="504" height="285"></a></p> <p>The model Tom prepared looks really amazing in HoloLens. Its quality is way beyond that of the majority of models I’ve seen so far. Here’s a video that shows how it looks from various angles. Simply beautiful!</p> <p align="center">&nbsp;</p> <p align="center"><iframe height="284" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9awATkNSEZg?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" width="500" allowfullscreen></iframe></p> <p align="center">&nbsp;</p> <p>My next step will be to animate the various components of the robot. My eventual goal is to do a couple of things: to have some user interactions that affect how the robot moves, of course, but also to have the robot “dance” to the music being played at the event. I haven’t yet decided whether I do this via the onboard sound processing, compensating for lag (but then what happens with multiple HoloLens devices?) or whether I create a simple Raspberry Pi- or Arduino-based server that does beat detection and controls the shared model in some way. We’ll see what makes most sense.</p> <p>Tom is also thinking about looking at at least <a href="http://new.abb.com/products/robotics/yumi" target="_blank">one other robot model</a> – with any luck we’ll soon have a few to choose from!</p>
