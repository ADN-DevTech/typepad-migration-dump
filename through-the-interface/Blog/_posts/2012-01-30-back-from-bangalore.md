Not that I’m under any illusions that there are people out there wondering where I am, but I did want to talk a little about my trip – and my connection to India – as the topic of today’s post.</p>  <p>I’ve been visiting Bangalore since I was a child: my parents met when my father was working there as an ex-pat for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monotype_Corporation" target="_blank">Monotype Corporation Ltd.</a> in the 1960s, and while (due to an accident of fate and, to some degree, politics) they ended up moving to the UK before I was born, I regularly visited my family in India during my childhood and retained a strong connection to the city.</p>  <p>Some time after starting work at Autodesk – and specifically within the Autodesk Developer Network team – I was happy to find that we were planning to build a small team based in Bangalore, and that I would end up having the opportunity to visit the city regularly (I went there for the first time for work in 1998, I think, and have been travelling back there regularly since).</p>  <p>I even ended up moving to Bangalore from 2003-2005, to help build a much larger team that would deliver consulting projects for customers as well as services through ADN. And while my wife and I hadn’t originally planned on having our first child there, being close to my family in India during that period did have some benefits. It was also during this period that I had my first experience with blogging: I started writing an internal (meaning “only visible to Autodesk employees”) blog about my experiences of living in India. I’m pretty sure it was mostly read by the “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desi" target="_blank">desi</a>” community in the US (who apparently – and happily – found my experiences entertaining).</p>  <p>Looking back, over the years I’ve been heavily involved in hiring and educating our Bangalore-based team – many of whom have now moved to other locations and to other roles within the company – and perhaps have a stronger connection to that team than to any of our other teams around the world.</p>  <p>So while this trip was primarily about the last of our DevDay events of the season – as Jim <a href="http://dances-with-elephants.typepad.com/blog/2012/01/busy-in-india.html" target="_blank">reported on his blog</a> – it was also an opportunity to spend time with the members of the team there. A fitting “final trip” within my current role in ADN.</p>  <p>Thanks to all of DevTech India for (as ever) making me feel so welcome. Viru, Partha, Balaji, Anand and Sandeep: I hope to see you all again, soon (although next time I expect it’ll be with my family, which will also be fun :-).</p>
