<p>This is the second time I’ve been at a Forge Accelerator this year in Munich, and it seems it won’t be the last: there’ll be another one in early December, adjacent to the European DevDay being held here, and I’m pretty certain I’ll be back across for that.</p>
<p>It was a fun, whirlwind three days. The weather was nice when I arrived at the office on Monday morning – here’s a view across towards one of the nearby buildings.</p>

<p>We had lots of participants, which was great. Here’s one of the rooms we occupied:</p>

<p>The weather was nice enough on the first day for us to eat outside (the next few days have been rainy, unfortunately). Here’s a cheeky shot I took of Jeremy Tammik eating soup: in the UK if you tell someone they’ll be eating through a straw it’s considered very threatening.</p>

<p>I had the chance to sync up with Cyrille regarding our joint AR/VR presentation at the <a href="http://au.autodesk.com/las-vegas/pre-conference/adn-conference-devdays" target="_blank">Autodesk DevDay</a> before AU 2016 in Las Vegas. Both demos are coming together nicely, which is great.</p>
<p>I took the chance to give several HoloLens demos both to people from the Munich office but also to Accelerator attendees (Acceleratees?). Here’s a quick snap of Jurgen Becker enjoying his demo while sporting a new Forge T-shirt.</p>

<p>I’m about to board my flight back to Zurich where I’ll stay overnight before attending meetings and presenting at a <a href="http://expandingimmersivedesign.ch/" target="_blank">VR conference</a> tomorrow at <a href="https://www.zhdk.ch/" target="_blank">ZHdK</a>. It’s proving to be a busy but worthwhile trip. I have at list one Forge Viewer-related post to document something we found out at the Accelerator, when I get the chance.</p>
