<p>The last few Wednesday mornings I’ve swung by <a href="http://goo.gl/maps/z9N6v" target="_blank">Place de la Gare</a> to visit the recently-opened <a href="http://fablab-neuch.ch" target="_blank">Fab Lab in Neuchâtel</a>. Here’s a quick video description of what <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fab_lab" target="_blank">Fab Labs</a> are about (and here’s <a href="http://fablabinternational.org/fab-lab/the-fab-charter" target="_blank">their charter</a>):</p>

<p>I was new to the concept of Fab Labs, but was excited to find out one now exists here (thankfully my wife listens to local radio! ;-). I’ve been jealous of my US-based Autodesk colleagues who have access to the excellent <a href="http://www.techshop.ws" target="_blank">TechShop</a> (Autodesk employees get free membership, which is a pretty fantastic benefit if you have one nearby). Having a Fab Lab nearby at least means I’ll get to scratch the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maker_culture" target="_blank">Maker</a> itch I’ve had, of late.</p>
<p>One of the reasons Autodesk originally set up shop in this region is its deep technical heritage: for those of you who aren&#39;t aware, the canton of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuch%C3%A2tel" target="_blank">Neuchâtel</a>&#0160;is considered the birthplace of the Swiss watch-making industry. If you ever visit, be sure to check out <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaquet-Droz_automata" target="_blank">the Jaquet-Droz automata</a>, the inspiration for the automaton in the movie <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0970179" target="_blank">Hugo</a>.</p>
<p>Given this heritage, it makes sense that there are a number of very highly-rated academic institutions in the area, including the <a href="http://www.he-arc.ch" target="_blank">Haute Ecole Arc</a>, which has sponsored the creation and running of the Fab Lab. Their curricula presumably focus more on precision engineering and micro-electronics than watch-making, specifically, but it&#39;s certainly at their roots.</p>
<p>Our local Fab Lab understandably doesn’t have the same level of equipment a typical TechShop does, but it does have some interesting – and useful – machinery. For instance, see below: there’s a laser cutter, with a laser-cut wine bottle holder (Neuchâtel&#0160;is also a <a href="http://fineswisswine.ch/swiss-wine-regions/neuchatel" target="_blank">wine-making region</a>, of course :-), and <a href="http://www.ultimaker.com" target="_blank">an Ultimaker 3D printer</a> (other 3D printer purchases are planned, apparently).</p>

<p>It being a creative space, some of the products (and offcuts) were on display, too:</p>

<p>One of the managers of the Fab Lab, Gaetan Bussy, was hard at work helping prototype an electrolytic pen to be used for art restoration.</p>

<p>I’m planning to head back to the Fab Lab during the coming weeks: it seems like a great environment for me to spend some time on my “Kinect for ZX Spectrum” integration. :-)</p>
