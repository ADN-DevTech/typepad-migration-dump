<p>It’s time for another trip down memory lane…</p>  <p>From time to time, I hear people talking about Autodesk’s more “radical” R&amp;D investments… whether in the <a href="http://www.autodesk.com/products/personal-design-and-creativity" target="_blank">consumer software</a> space – much of which is being driven by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maker_culture" target="_blank">Maker</a> movement – or related to the <a href="http://www.autodeskresearch.com/groups/nano" target="_blank">bio/nano</a> research <a href="http://www.autodeskresearch.com/people/andrewhessel" target="_blank">Andrew Hessel</a> and team are performing at <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2014/03/pier-9.html" target="_blank">Pier 9</a>. I can understand that to some this might seem as though Autodesk is departing from its core mission, in some way.</p>  <p>I have a slightly different perspective on this… yes, we had perhaps 15 years of our history – largely during the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carol_Bartz#CEO_of_Autodesk" target="_blank">Bartz</a> era – where we were laser-focused on democratizing CAD, acting as a “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-mover_advantage" target="_blank">fast follower</a>” in the industry. But go back a little further and you’ll remember <a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/autofile/www/section2_115_1.html" target="_blank">projects</a> that would’ve been perfectly at home in an “Autodesk <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_X" target="_blank">X</a>” division: <a href="http://www.hyper.com/?TabId=385" target="_blank">HyperChem</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Xanadu" target="_blank">Xanadu</a>, the <a href="http://www.worldcat.org/title/cyberspace-developer-kit/oclc/31817874" target="_blank">Cyberspace Developer Kit</a>… (yes, we were doing VR back in 1987 at 4 frames per second :-) and “Chaos: The Software”. (You’ll find references to the first two in the<a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2008/10/an-interview-wi.html" target="_blank"> final part of my interview with John Walker from 2008</a>.)</p>  <p>I remember loving <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Gleick" target="_blank">James Gleick</a>’s “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos:_Making_a_New_Science" target="_blank">Chaos: Making a New Science</a><sub></sub>”, back in the day. (Later on I also really enjoyed his <a href="http://around.com/isaac-newton/" target="_blank">biography of Isaac Newton</a>, which I found to be a great companion volume to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neal_Stephenson" target="_blank">Neal Stephenson</a>’s much more speculative – but still excellent – <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Baroque_Cycle" target="_blank">Baroque Cycle</a>.) This was the book that popularized the “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly_effect" target="_blank">butterfly effect</a>”, and without it I doubt very much we’d have had <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Pratchett" target="_blank">Terry Pratchett</a>’s wonderful <a href="http://wiki.lspace.org/mediawiki/Quantum_weather_butterflies" target="_blank">quantum weather butterflies</a> (who flap their wings to create miniature thunderstorms to fend off predators).</p>  <p>Back in the late 1980s, <a href="http://around.com/chaos-the-software-keeps-on-ticking/" target="_blank">James Gleick</a> collaborated with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=User:Jpgordon" target="_blank">Josh Gordon</a>, <a href="http://www.rudyrucker.com/blog/2011/01/24/the-classic-chaos-software-goes-multiplatform/" target="_blank">Rudy Rucker</a> and <a href="http://fourmilab.ch" target="_blank">John Walker</a> on an Autodesk-branded suite of tools allowing people to explore chaos theory.</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b8d1339c0f970c-pi" target="_blank"><img title="CHAOS - The Software" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 50px auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="CHAOS - The Software" src="/assets/image_626694.jpg" width="394" height="218" /></a></p>  <p>I didn’t actually get to use “Chaos: The Software” myself, until now – when I joined Autodesk the product had already been retired – so I was thrilled to find out over the weekend that it has been available for several years not only <a href="http://www.rudyrucker.com/oldhomepage/zip/chaos.zip" target="_blank">in executable format</a> but <a href="http://www.rudyrucker.com/oldhomepage/zip/chaossrc.zip" target="_blank">as source code</a> (see the <a href="http://www.rudyrucker.com/oldhomepage/chaos.htm" target="_blank">download page</a> on Rudy’s site for the licensing/copyright, etc. – as shareware it’s fine for non-commercial use but you’ll need special permission to use it for commercial purposes).</p>  <p>The source code is in C and assembly language and uses the Metashel DOS GUI.</p>  <p>The executable can be run on old Windows systems or using the free <a href="http://www.dosbox.com" target="_blank">DOSBox</a> tool. Here’s a video of me running “Chaos: The Software” on my Mac using DOSBox:</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p align="center"><iframe height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WV4iTwt93B0?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" width="480" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>There’s certainly more to “Chaos: The Software” than I’ve shown in this video. I’m going to spend some more time playing with it, when I get the chance, although as the User Guide doesn’t appear to be available anywhere online it might be hard to get to grips with its full capabilities.</p>  <p>It seems that while Rudy Rucker was at Autodesk, he also worked on an “Artificial Life Lab” program called <a href="http://www.cs.sjsu.edu/faculty/rucker/boppers.htm" target="_blank">Boppers</a>: this, too, is available with full source code – and for Visual Studio 2010 – so I’m also hoping to find the time to take a look at that.</p>  <p>Does anyone remember using any of these tools, back in the day? If so, post a comment!</p>
