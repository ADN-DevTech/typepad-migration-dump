<p>The clock is ticking… the Exchange Apps Portathon is being held next weekend, and it’s not too late to participate.</p>
<p>If you’re not sure what this is all about, take a look at two <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2013/07/autodesk-exchange-apps-portathon-code-for-cash.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">previous</a> <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2013/08/reminder-about-the-upcoming-portathon.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">posts</a> about this event. In a nutshell: Autodesk is paying developers $100 for each of the first 5 apps that developers publish to Exchange Apps before the end of the weekend, and the DevTech team will be online for a solid 48 hours to help people get there.</p>
<p>On a side note, the DevTech team now has <a href="http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6Fl_1mFNt0rBqa068Vaxcg" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a YouTube channel</a> for their DevTV sessions. There are at least a few videos on publishing to Exchange Apps and several more on using the APIs to Autodesk products. It looks like a very useful resource – be sure to head on over and take a look.</p>
