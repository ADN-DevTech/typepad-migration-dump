I may have that wrong, of course, and I’ll be sure to come back and correct this post if so.</p><p>Many (if not all) of these new hires will be focused on building out the <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2021/11/getting-ready-for-tandem-a-call-to-action-for-forge-developers.html" target="_blank">connected capabilities of Tandem</a> (which you can think of as building out Dasher-like features within the Tandem product). So I’m highly invested in helping the Tandem team get good people. If you’re interested in joining a highly dynamic product team for what I expect to be an exciting ride, be sure to apply soon.</p>
