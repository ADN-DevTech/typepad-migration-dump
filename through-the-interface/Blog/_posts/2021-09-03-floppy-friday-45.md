<p><a href="https://youtu.be/RwIEFjRLnFY" rel="noopener" target="_blank">This week’s episode</a> contains another eclectic mix of ancient Commodore 64 video games. We started with <a href="https://www.c64-wiki.com/wiki/Snoopy" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Snoopy</a>, which turned out to be rather basic and tedious. We then tried <a href="https://www.pixelbeschallung.at/trucking-u-s-a-c64-1984" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Trucking USA</a>, which turned out to be in German. From there things became more interesting, with a fun platformer called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BurgerTime" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Burger Time</a>, a classic arcade conversion of a game called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_Wolf_(video_game)" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Sea Wolf</a>, and finally a quirky little number called <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/pegasis" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Pegasis</a>.</p>

<p>I rather enjoyed Burger Time and Sea Wolf – as you can probably tell from the video – but the whole episode was fun to record.</p>
<p>Here’s the cover art I could find, although why Snoopy is called Johnny is anyone’s guess.</p>
