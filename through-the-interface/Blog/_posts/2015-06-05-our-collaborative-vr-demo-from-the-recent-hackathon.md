<p>I wanted to post on a more in-depth topic, today, but I’ve been heads-down working on <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2015/05/cooling-down-after-the-sf-vr-hackathon.html" target="_blank">our project from the recent VR Hackathon</a>, getting ready to push it live. We’ve made really good progress over the last few days, especially considering it’s only a part-time project for Lars, Oleg and myself. We’ve implemented per-session support and a number of other important features (Lars has also spent some serious time re-factoring the code – it’s certainly more elegant than what I’d usually crank out ;-). The code is all <a href="http://github.com/KeanW/vr-party" target="_blank">here</a>, in case.</p>  <p>Here’s a quick audio-less demo, to give you a sense for how it works. Imagine the two pages on the right are on someone’s (or two people’s) phone(s), and you’ll get the idea: people in the VR space can move the view by rotating their heads, but there’s someone curating the experience for them.</p>  <br />  <p align="center"> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hngVL_ngh34?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>  <br />  <br />  <p>Very interestingly, Google announced their <a href="https://www.google.com/edu/expeditions/" target="_blank">Expeditions</a> project <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/05/28/google-launches-expeditions-an-app-for-shared-virtual-school-field-trips/" target="_blank">at last week’s Google I/O</a>, which in many ways is a similar concept (although intended for the classroom, where teachers will use VR to take their students on virtual field trips). Every great idea has its time, I suppose! :-)</p>  <p>More on this after weekend… hopefully we’ll be ready to launch sometime next week.</p>
