<p>I’d like to wish a very “Happy New Year” to all readers of the Through the Interface blog. I’m currently still up in the mountains, enjoying a few more days of snow before diving back into work, but thought I’d post a quick message to wish you all the best for the coming year.</p>
<p>Over the next few weeks I’ll post about some thoughts I’ve been having about some potential (and hopefully very fun) robotics integrations with AutoCAD – inspired by the very cool <a href="http://thymio.org" target="_blank">Thymio</a> robot that my kids got for Christmas – as well as about my first trip to our Tel Aviv office (I’m heading there from January 14-17).</p>
<p>Should be a fun start to 2014… :-)</p>
