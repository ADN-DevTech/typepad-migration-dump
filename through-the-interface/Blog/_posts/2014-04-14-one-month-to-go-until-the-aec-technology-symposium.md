<p>As Jeremy has pointed out <a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2014/04/no-devcamp-better-ny-aec-technology-symposium.html" target="_blank">on his blog</a>, in lieu of a dedicated AEC DevCamp – as has been run every other year for some years – Autodesk and the ADN team will be supporting the upcoming <a href="http://core.thorntontomasetti.com/aec-technology-symposium-2014" target="_blank">AEC Technology Symposium</a> being held in New York on May 16-18.</p>
<p>As with the DevCamps, this is a great opportunity to get to know the people behind our AEC products – whether product management or software engineering – so you can build relationships and get a better sense of where Autodesk is heading in the AEC industry.</p>
<p>There will also be a Hackathon held on May 17-18, after the symposium itself on May 16, so you’ll be able to play around with cutting edge Autodesk technology and have hands-on assistance from some highly knowledgeable Autodesk personnel.</p>
<p>[<em>As a reminder, this post has been queued up in advance of my holidays in the UK, so please don’t expect responses to any blog comments until next week.</em>]</p>
