<p>Last year <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2014/12/signing-off-from-2014.html" target="_blank">I posted</a> a <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/files/Xmas.htm" target="_blank">holiday card</a> serving up random links to posts from this blog’s full archive (prior to that post). This year I wasn’t feeling particularly inventive and so thought I’d rustle up a quick version that shows a random post from the subsequent year. Which may well be more useful: people typically find their way to code-centric posts using search and are hopefully interested in random links to more topical posts. Here is <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/files/Xmas2.htm" target="_blank">the 2015 version of this card</a>, in any case:</p>
<br/><p><iframe onload="resizeIframe(this, 1.15)" frameborder="0" name="3d_viewer" src="//through-the-interface.typepad.com/files/Xmas2.htm" width="90%"></iframe></p>
<p>Looking back, I started the year with a series <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2015/01/recreating-the-star-wars-opening-crawl-in-autocad-using-f-part-1.html" target="_blank">recreating</a> the <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2015/01/recreating-the-star-wars-opening-crawl-in-autocad-using-f-part-2.html" target="_blank">Star Wars</a> <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2015/01/recreating-the-star-wars-opening-crawl-in-autocad-using-f-part-3.html" target="_blank">opening</a> <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2015/01/recreating-the-star-wars-opening-crawl-in-autocad-using-f-part-4.html" target="_blank">crawl</a> in AutoCAD using F#, so I suppose it’s fitting that I post one more time to update the series before the end of the year. Especially as I’m going to be watching The Force Awakens this afternoon, given the December 16th release date in French-speaking Switzerland. I don’t plan on taking notes or live tweeting during the showing (the latter of which <a href="https://twitter.com/kellings/status/675073661406171137" target="_blank">might well prove suicidal</a>, even if today’s lifting of the press embargo means we’ll probably hear about little else), so hopefully <a href="http://swapi.co/api/films/7" target="_blank">this page</a> will have an updated “opening_crawl” for me to use in the next day or two.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I wish you and yours all the very best for the holiday season. Merry Christmas, one and all!</p>
