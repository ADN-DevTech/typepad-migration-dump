<p>This is a big week for 1980s computing. Wednesday marked <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/av/technology-56098808" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the 40th birthday of the BBC Microcomputer</a>, the machine that helped launch thousands of software development careers (<a href="https://www.keanw.com/2012/10/retro-computing-with-the-raspberry-pi.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">including mine</a>) in the UK.</p>
<p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20263e99294c9200b-pi" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="x-default" border="0" height="356" src="/assets/image_827433.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="x-default" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>This was such an important machine, in so many ways: it was really well engineered, with great performance, but also – due to government subsidies – available in the majority of schools in the UK.</p>
<p>For my Computer Science A-level I used some networked Beebs to automate a hypothetical fast food restaurant: from touchpad-driven ordering by customers to printing of receipts and stock control. Here’s an image of the kind of touchpad I used (although this one is A3, I think mine was only A4):</p>

<p>While I don’t (yet? :-) own a BBC Micro, I did receive some boxes containing four of its 1980s siblings, late last week. So <a href="https://youtu.be/jxzvSgQzMeQ" rel="noopener" target="_blank">this week’s Floppy Friday</a> is a simple retro unboxing, showing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX81" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ZX81</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Commodore 64</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amstrad_CPC#CPC464" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Amstrad CPC464</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX_Spectrum#plus" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ZX Spectrum+</a> that I received (some in their original packaging, which was pretty cool).</p>

<p>Hopefully this brought back good memories for people, just as it did for me as I was exploring the contents. I’m going to need to perform some simple mods on some of these new old computers to support composite video output, so it may be a while before we see something other than a C64 during Floppy Fridays, though.</p>
