<p>After returning from Paris on Friday afternoon, I came across with my family to the UK on Saturday. Our first stop was at Eton – where <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2019/05/in-new-orleans-for-techx-2019.html" target="_blank">an old friend of mine</a> lives. We used his home for a base to head up to Watford on Sunday to do the <a href="https://www.wbstudiotour.co.uk/" target="_blank">Harry Potter Studio Tour</a>, something my kids had been asking to do for the longest time.</p><p>We were on the tour starting at 11am: we’d ended up having to buy over-priced tickets from <a href="https://www.goldentours.com/" target="_blank">a secondary tour operator</a> and throwing away the bus transfer from central London… these secondary operators tend to buy up the tickets for certain periods, making it the only way to get tickets. Anyway, we were able to go directly to Watford and pick the entrance tickets up once the bus had arrived.</p><p>The magic started already at the entrance to the tour.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a48e9d41200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="The tour atrium" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="The tour atrium" src="/assets/image_86761.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>After a relatively short common introduction we were free to wander around at our own pace. There was plenty to see.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4dc65ca200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Hogwarts stairs" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Hogwarts stairs" src="/assets/image_305623.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>As we’re on the lead-up to Halloween there were some special Dark Arts-focused exhibits. I really liked one that looking at the evolution of the Death Eater masks: these went from being skulls in the Goblet of Fire to being much more stylised in the Deathly Hallows movies.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4b7d063200d-pi"><img width="500" height="375" title="Handcrafted Death Eater masks" style="margin: 30px auto; float: none; display: block;" alt="Handcrafted Death Eater masks" src="/assets/image_590595.jpg"></a></p><p>In general I really liked the physical workshop props. They reminded me of <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2017/10/wellington.html" target="_blank">our trip to Weta in New Zealand</a>.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4dc65d1200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Here be horrors" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Here be horrors" src="/assets/image_37376.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warwick_Davis" target="_blank">Warwick Davis</a> has played several roles in the movies, and one of the exhibits focused on a mask made for him to transform into a goblin.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a48e9844200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="One of Warwick Davis's many faces" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="One of Warwick Davis's many faces" src="/assets/image_194547.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>There was fun Kinect-based interactive exhibit that allowed you to animate Dobby, the house-elf.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4dc65d8200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Interactive Dobby" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Interactive Dobby" src="/assets/image_378668.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>The kids loved Diagon Alley, of course.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4b7d4e9200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Diagon Alley" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Diagon Alley" src="/assets/image_764698.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Another treat was the Hogwarts Express, which contained a number of compartments with props from the various films. (We’d had a seperate compartment to ourselves in the train from Neuchatel to Geneva, on the way to the airport, so the theme had been set early on in our trip.)</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a48e9d45200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="375" height="500" title="The Hogwarts Express" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="The Hogwarts Express" src="/assets/image_174434.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>You have to pose at the entrance to Platform 9 3/4, of course.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a48e9d4d200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="375" height="500" title="Platform 9 and three quarters" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Platform 9 and three quarters" src="/assets/image_469824.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Halfway through the tour we stopped for a butterbeer, which unfortunately was truly awful (for our tastes, at least).</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4dc65dc200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="375" height="500" title="Butterbeer" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Butterbeer" src="/assets/image_291131.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Which probably explained the inclusion of liquids disposal at the recycling area.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4b7d070200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Butterbeer disposal" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Butterbeer disposal" src="/assets/image_20487.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>It was fun to see the (sadly non-functional) Knight Bus.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a48e983c200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="The Knight Bus" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="The Knight Bus" src="/assets/image_108658.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>There was a section of the Hogwarts Bridge – something that apparently didn’t appear in books, but has become a much-loved feature in the films.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4dc65e1200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="The Hogwarts bridge section" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="The Hogwarts bridge section" src="/assets/image_976498.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Something I really liked about the tour was the focus on architectural design. They appeared in physical form on the walls…</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a48e984d200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Lots of architectural drawings" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Lots of architectural drawings" src="/assets/image_58018.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>As well as at times being projected…</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a48e9868200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Projection" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Projection" src="/assets/image_16071.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>There were various physical models. Here’s one showing the destruction of Gringott’s Bank.<a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a48e9d51200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="375" height="500" title="The destroyed Gringott's vault" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="The destroyed Gringott's vault" src="/assets/image_226688.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Here’s The Great Hall:</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4b7d085200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="The Great Hall" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="The Great Hall" src="/assets/image_846342.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>There were a number of small-scale models of Hogwarts.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a48e9868200c-pi" target="_blank"><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4b7d089200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Architectural model of Hogwarts" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Architectural model of Hogwarts" src="/assets/image_699950.jpg" border="0"></a></a></p><p>Here’s the bridge again:</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4b7d08d200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="The Hogwarts bridge" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="The Hogwarts bridge" src="/assets/image_963281.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>The most amazing example was the 1:24 scale model of the entire Hogwarts castle. It apparently took 74 man-years to build. Utterly incredible.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4b7d091200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Hogwarts scale model" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Hogwarts scale model" src="/assets/image_504415.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>We had to get a few commemorative photos, etc. but I was pleasantly surprised about how little my kids wanted to buy things from the gargantuan gift shop.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a48e9d57200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="343" height="550" title="Wanted Wizards" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Wanted Wizards" src="/assets/image_905927.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>After a full day at the tour, we headed back to Eton and then wandered to the Windsor riverside for a drink.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a48e9828200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Eton Riverside at dusk" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Eton Riverside at dusk" src="/assets/image_608104.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>On Monday we headed across to Islington, where we spent some time by the river. (My brother lives on a narrowboat in London, although his is moored elsewhere.)</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4b7d095200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Down by the river in Islington" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Down by the river in Islington" src="/assets/image_34744.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4b7d09d200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="The river in Islington" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="The river in Islington" src="/assets/image_743040.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>As our train to Edinburgh was only departing from Euston Station at just before midnight, we killed an hour or two in a very picturesque pub.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4b7d0a5200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="The Old Queens Head" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="The Old Queens Head" src="/assets/image_614020.jpg" border="0"></a><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4b7d0a9200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Inside the Queens Head" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Inside the Queens Head" src="/assets/image_429237.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Eventually we made our way to Euston, where our sleeper train awaited. We had three sleeper compartments – each with two bunks – which was also very much in keeping with the trip’s theme.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4dc65f4200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Sleeper train arriving in Edinburgh" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Sleeper train arriving in Edinburgh" src="/assets/image_69777.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>We managed to get some rest – not a huge amount, but enough – before arriving in Edinburgh at 7:20am. The sun was shining on this beautiful city.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a48e9d5d200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="397" height="471" title="Arriving in Edinburgh" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Arriving in Edinburgh" src="/assets/image_747333.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>We were able to check in early to our Airbnb, thankfully. It has a lovely view from the front across the park, and an equally nice one behind across to Bruntsfield Church. The rainbow isn’t there the whole time, of course.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4dc65fc200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="375" height="500" title="View from our Airbnb" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="View from our Airbnb" src="/assets/image_22107.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>We managed to a explore the city a little, while the weather was good.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4b7d0ad200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Greyfriars cemetery" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Greyfriars cemetery" src="/assets/image_745359.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>While we didn’t go inside, we did head to the castle to check the view from the top.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a48e9886200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Edinburgh Castle" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Edinburgh Castle" src="/assets/image_249070.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>We had lunch in what we had thought was an old gothic church, but is apparently <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hub,_Edinburgh" target="_blank">an events centre</a>.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4dc6601200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="375" height="500" title="The Hub" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="The Hub" src="/assets/image_73635.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>In the afternoon it was time to get some work done, which thankfully only meant meeting up for a few prepatory drinks with Zach Kron from the Dynamo/Refinery team and Anthony Hauck from Hypar. It was a good opportunity to plan for the next day’s one-day pre-BiLT Hackathon.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4dc6606200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Hanging with the Zach and Anthony" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Hanging with the Zach and Anthony" src="/assets/image_736906.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Today it’s the Hackathon itself, which I’ll talk about in my next post. (My family is off doing more Harry Potter-related activities – walking tours and suchlike – as there’s a <a href="https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Edinburgh" target="_blank">strong connection between Edinburgh and the books</a>.)</p>
