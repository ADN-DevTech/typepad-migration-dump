<p>On Friday we had our first external visitors to the VR room at Autodesk Neuchatel. Jose and Erich came across from <a href="http://www.amstein-walthert.ch/en/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Amstein + Walthert</a>, an engineering firm headquartered in Zurich. Jose had reached out to me – we’ve been in contact a few times, over the years – as he’d read about the VR room on this blog and was curious to try it out.</p>
<p>The room still isn’t 100% ready – we’re waiting for some furniture to show up – but it seemed a good opportunity to try out some of our VR demos on live volunteers.</p>
<p>Here’s the rundown of the demos that we walked through, showing a range of VR and AR projects:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Google Earth VR</strong></li>
<ul>
<li>I’m showing this a lot as an intro to VR: the UX is best-in-class and a great example of what’s possible.</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Autodesk LIVE</strong></li>
<ul>
<li>We fired up Revit with one of A + W’s models which we then published to Stingray via the LIVE plugin.</li>
<li>While this was processing we took a look at the <a href="http://area.autodesk.com/LIVE-samples-1-6" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">enhanced Villa Martini sample model</a>, which gives a great sense of both LIVE’s and Stingray’s VR capabilities.</li>
<li>Once the processing was complete, we took a quick look at the generated results. (In this case we didn’t spend a huge amount of time on this: as an MEP model it didn’t include much in the way of architecture, and so there really wasn’t much of interest to see.)</li>
</ul>
<li><strong>Autodesk VRED</strong></li>
<ul>
<li>We then spent some time looking at a collaborative design review example (oriented towards automotive customers, by who doesn’t like cars? ;-) inside VRED.</li>
<li>While focused on automotive, it gives a great sense of the possibilities afforded by collaborative VR.</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Autodesk Forge viewer</strong></li>
<ul>
<li>We took a look at some of the early VR-related features in the Forge viewer.</li>
<ul>
<li>We used <a href="http://lmv.ninja">http://lmv.ninja</a> for this… I’ll spend some time talking about how to try WebVR for yourself using this site in the coming days.</li>
<li>We used a special WebVR-enabled build of Chromium to be able to connect the Forge viewer to the HTC Vive headset.</li>
</ul>
<li>We also took a look at <a href="http://vrok.it" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Vrok-It</a>, which is another example of how collaborative VR might be useful to people.</li>
<ul>
<li>For this we just used mobile phones to see it work via Google Cardboard.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<li><strong>Microsoft HoloLens</strong></li>
<ul>
<li>To wrap up we moved from VR to AR, looking at a couple of HoloLens demos.</li>
<li>The first was – of course – the Dancing Robot. This is the main example I generally use to show collaborative hologram review and manipulation.</li>
<li>The second was Cyrille Fauvel’s Forge content demo, where we see some content that was brought into HoloLens via the Forge Model Derivative API. It’s great because you get meta-data, something that’s invariably of interest to people wanting to use AR professionally.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>There were other VR demos I could have shown, too – such as Autodesk ReMake – but I chose the above based on both the work A + W does and on Jose and Erich’s interests. It was really a fun afternoon: a big thanks to Jose and Erich for making the trip across and being my first test subjects!</p>
