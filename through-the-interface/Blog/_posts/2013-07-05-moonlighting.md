<p>I had a fun Saturday morning, a couple of weeks ago. An old school-friend of my wife’s is a partner in <a href="http://www.tattyoo.com" target="_blank">a temporary art tattoo business</a> (which hopefully means a business that sells temporary art tattoos rather than a temporary business that sells art tattoos ;-), and they were looking for bald models to help showcase their wares.</p>
<p>So I went along for my first – and quite possibly last – modelling assignment. The fact that they were only interested in the top of my head made the gig a lot easier. Here’s the resulting image:</p>
<p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201901e1907f8970b-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="Off the top of my head" border="0" height="360" src="/assets/image_481739.jpg" style="background-image: none; margin: 20px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="Off the top of my head" width="450" /></a></p>
<p>What’s interesting is that – due to the position of the camera and the perspective effect – to make it look as though I was walking casually I actually had to keep my legs stretched quite some distance in opposite directions. And then make minute adjustments over an extended period to get the shot just right. I have to admit it was fun, though.</p>
<p>Anyway, I now know that cranial modelling is a tough business and I’m certainly glad I didn’t give up my day job. Especially as I was paid in tattoos (well, actually that should be tattoo (singular): the one I was wearing when I left the studio ;-).</p>
