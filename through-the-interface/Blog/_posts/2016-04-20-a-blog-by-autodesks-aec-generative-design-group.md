<p>I’ve been spending more time looking at generative design in recent months (although this is a relative thing… I’ve still only posted <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2016/02/isovist-analysis-in-dynamo-studio.html" target="_blank">once about Dynamo</a>, for instance). So far a big chunk of my research has been understanding what’s going on in different parts of the company with respect to generative design.</p> <p>As part of this effort, several months ago I chatted with <a href="https://twitter.com/anthonyhauck" target="_blank">Anthony Hauck</a> who heads up a team focused on generative design in the AEC space. He talked to me about Project Akaba – an early generative tool for space planning – and its successor, Project Fractal. At the time Project Fractal was still in the planning phase, but things have moved on considerably since then.</p> <p>Just today I was happy to discover that Anthony and team <a href="http://thebuildinglab.info" target="_blank">started a blog</a> around the time of AU2015, and have been posting some really interesting information to it.</p> <p align="center"><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b7c840673b970b-pi" target="_blank"><img title="The Building Lab" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 30px 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="The Building Lab" src="/assets/image_832574.jpg" width="500" height="429"></a></p> <p>For instance, here’s a video they posted a couple of weeks ago that shows some of the progress they’re making with Fractal:</p> <p align="center">&nbsp;</p> <p align="center"><iframe height="375" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/y-b9GCRzLrU?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" width="500" allowfullscreen></iframe></p> <p align="center">&nbsp;</p> <p>If you’re interested in generative design – especially in terms of how it’s used in AEC – then I strongly recommend checking this blog regularly.</p>
