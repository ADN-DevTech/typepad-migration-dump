<p>I’m nearing the end of my trip to Toronto: our annual internal Technical Summit was a great success – there were 500 attendees, this year, and as always is a really good opportunity to find out about other parts of the organisation and to meet new people – and today I’ve been hanging out at a specially hosted open house at Autodesk’s King Street office.</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201a3fd18ef3b970b-pi" target="_blank"><img title="The photo booth" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; float: left; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px 20px 0px 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px" border="0" alt="The photo booth" src="/assets/image_927892.jpg" width="114" align="left" height="187" /></a>To mark the end of the summit, last night there was an event at the Ontario Science Centre, where we had lots of fun experimenting with some interesting “reality capture” technology.</p>  <p>They had a special photo booth where you had your picture taken and pixelised into a low-res monochrome representation which was then used to feed a set of water-filled tubes with bubbles for the pixels.</p>    <p>It wasn’t always very clear in the room, but came out pretty well if you took snaps using your mobile phone:</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201a511c8645b970c-pi"><img title="Bubbles rising" style="float: none; margin: 20px auto; display: block" alt="Bubbles rising" src="/assets/image_848641.jpg" width="386" height="684" /></a></p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201a3fd18eef7970b-pi" target="_blank"><img title="And the Oscar for the best beard goes to.." style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; float: right; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 0px 20px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px" border="0" alt="And the Oscar for the best beard goes to.." src="/assets/image_78982.jpg" width="166" align="right" height="280" /></a>So far today’s open house has been great: various Toronto-based teams – such as the Alias, Maya, PLM 360 and Autodesk Research teams, to name a few – have set up booths and shown people the work they’re doing.</p>  <p>There was even an opportunity to have your picture taken holding an actual Oscar, an “Academy Award of Merit” Autodesk received in 2002 for the Maya product.</p>  <p>That’s it from me, for this week: next week I’ll be back digging into some more technical issues.</p>
