<p>I’d like to extend a warm welcome to the Autodesk developer blogosphere to Doug Redmond, who has recently started a blog focused on programming and administering Autodesk Vault, <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/">It’s All Just Ones and Zeros</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20120a5a3590b970b-pi"><img align="right" alt="New Autodesk Vault Developer Blog - It&#39;s All Just Ones And Zeros" border="0" height="278" src="/assets/image_865291.jpg" style="BORDER-RIGHT-WIDTH: 0px; MARGIN: 0px 10px 0px 20px; DISPLAY: inline; BORDER-TOP-WIDTH: 0px; BORDER-BOTTOM-WIDTH: 0px; BORDER-LEFT-WIDTH: 0px" title="New Autodesk Vault Developer Blog - It&#39;s All Just Ones And Zeros" width="263" /></a> </p>
<p>Doug is a long-time contributor to Autodesk’s development community, whether helping my team deal with complex API issues or presenting the Vault API at ADN events and at AU, he has a boundless passion for helping people customizing and developing with Autodesk Vault.</p>
<p>If you’re interested in working deeply with Vault technology – or are already doing so – then I’m sure that Doug’s blog will prove an invaluable resource for you.</p>
