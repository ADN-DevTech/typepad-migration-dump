<p>While I was <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2021/10/rome-and-sardinia.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">away on vacation</a> I received the news that the excellent <a href="https://learnforge.autodesk.io" rel="noopener" target="_blank">learnforge.autodesk.io</a> website – a great resource for learning how to develop software that uses <a href="https://forge.autodesk.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Autodesk Forge</a> – has been translated into Japanese, Traditional Chinese, and Simplified Chinese.</p>
<p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20282e12a5d51200b-pi" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="LearnForge international" height="451" src="/assets/image_771754.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; float: none; display: block;" title="LearnForge international" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>This will be of great use to customers and would-be Forge developers who are keen to learn more about the platform but have a better grasp of Japanese or Chinese than English. If you have more requests for languages (I know at least one more is in the pipeline), then please post a comment and I’ll pass it on to the Developer Advocacy and Support team.</p>
