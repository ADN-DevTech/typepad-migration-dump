<p>As with <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2010/09/photo-scene-editor-competition.html" target="_blank">the previous contest</a>, the winner stands to win a tricked out iPad plus a signed (by Carl Bass, Autodesk’s CEO) copy of 3ds Max or 3ds Max Design. <a href="http://labs.blogs.com/its_alive_in_the_lab/2010/10/second-photofly-contest.html" target="_blank">See Scott’s blog for details</a>. The deadline for this competition is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_Fawkes_Night" target="_blank">Guy Fawkes Night</a>, November 5th.</p>
<p>Apparently the iPad is one of a kind, but as this is the second such competition, I have my doubts. ;-)</p>
<p>Oh, and yes, only inhabitants of USA and Canada are eligible to win these prizes, quite sadly, but that shouldn’t stop people from entering for the fun and prestige.</p>
