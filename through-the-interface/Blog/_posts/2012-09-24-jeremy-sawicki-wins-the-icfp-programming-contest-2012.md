<p>Congratulations to fellow Autodesker, Jeremy Sawicki, on claiming first prize in the <a href="http://www.icfpconference.org" target="_blank">ICFP</a> (International Conference on Functional Programming) <a href="http://icfpcontest2012.wordpress.com" target="_blank">Programming Contest 2012</a>.</p>  <p>In his day job, Jeremy is a fellow software architect on the Revit team, although to win this prestigious competition Jeremy clearly functions at a much higher order (yes, that was actually a functional programming joke, right there ;-).</p>  <p>To find out more about <a href="http://icfpcontest2012.wordpress.com/task/" target="_blank">the task</a> and <a href="http://www.sawicki.us/icfp/2012/" target="_blank">Jeremy’s solution</a>, watch this video (Jeremy’s team – Frictionless Bananas, of which Jeremy was captain and sole member – is introduced at around the 24m mark and talks about his implementation from about 29m30s):</p> <iframe height="353" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/5TCqUU3-GT0" frameborder="0" width="470" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>  <p>To summarise this year’s task: to code the behaviour of a “robot” to play a 2D platform game called “Lambda Lifter” that seems to have been influenced by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boulder_Dash" target="_blank">Boulder Dash</a> (for the game-play) and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manic_Miner" target="_blank">Manic Miner</a> (for the name). Jeremy’s solution used C++ – the choice of programming language was completely open and not limited to functional languages – and was the outright winner by a considerable margin.</p>  <p>This is a huge achievement – many congratulations, Jeremy! :-)</p>  <p>I asked Jeremy a few questions about the contest…</p>  <p><strong>Where does your team’s name come from?</strong></p>  <p>It came from a physics discussion about the force exerted by a marble rolling along the inside of a semicircular object.&#160; I referred to the object as a “frictionless banana,” which promptly ended the discussion due to laughter, but a team name was born.</p>  <p><strong></strong></p>  <p><strong>How many times have you entered the ICFP Programming Contest?</strong></p>  <p>I’ve participated on and off since 2001, submitting solutions in eight years and working on the task without ultimately submitting anything in several others.</p>  <p><strong>Is this the first time your team has won?</strong></p>  <p>I’ve placed in the contest twice before: second place in 2004 as part of a two person team and Judges’ Prize in 2011 for being the highest scoring single person team.&#160; This year was the first time in first place.</p>  <p><strong>What was the toughest part of the challenge?</strong></p>  <p>I often find that the contest is won more by finding a clever strategy than by programming per se, and this year was no different.&#160; Typical search techniques would have been too slow, requiring an exponentially growing amount of time to explore all possible sequences of moves.&#160; The biggest challenge was to find heuristics that could perform decently on a variety of maps in a reasonable amount of time.</p>  <p><strong>How many hours do you estimate you spent during the long weekend of the competition?</strong></p>  <p>As a guess I’ll say 36 hours total, starting lighter at the beginning and culminating in an all-nighter on the last day.</p>  <p><strong>What drove your choice of language?</strong></p>  <p>When faced with a limited amount of time to accomplish as much as possible, the best language is the language you know best.&#160; I’ve used Haskell in some past contests, but years of developing Revit in C++ on a daily basis have made it the language where I can be most effective.</p>  <p><strong>Will you enter again?</strong></p>  <p>Absolutely.</p>
