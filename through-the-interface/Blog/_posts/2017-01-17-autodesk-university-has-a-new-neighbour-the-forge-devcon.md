It will take place on November 13 &amp; 14, i.e. Monday and Tuesday of the Autodesk University week (which in recent years has been when the DevDay and DevLab has happened).</p> <p>This is a good thing, in my opinion. Somewhat selfishly it’ll mean less travel for those of us coming across from Europe, but it will also make AU a more compelling, developer-centric event. I’ve been organising the VR/AR track for the DevCon, and at least one of the candidate presenters would prefer to speak during AU given the former timing… I know it’s only one data-point, but as that’s the only feedback I’ve heard thus far it’s overwhelmingly in favour of the change. :-)</p> <p>The new timing does present me with some logistical issues to work out, however. I have some interesting plans in the works for the latter half of the year, so I may yet end up having to miss both AU and the DevCon for the first time in many years. More about that in due course, though.</p>
