<p>It’s Friday – and a holiday in the US – so it’s time for some fun…</p> <p>Some weeks ago I received an interesting device through the post. It’s called the <a href="http://www.3drudder.com/" target="_blank">3D Rudder</a> and is made by a startup in Marseille. They’ve basically created a foot-controlled joystick with three degrees of freedom, so you can control roll, pitch and yaw, all while keeping your hands free.</p> <p>The makers of the 3D Rudder originally intended it for navigating in 3D design applications – one of the founders is an architect by background – so their interest in me playing with it is mainly to provide a basic integration with AutoCAD. They have a <a href="http://www.3drudder.com/windows-sdk-virtual-reality-app-development/" target="_blank">.NET SDK</a>, so it shouldn’t be too hard to put something together and share it on GitHub… expect to see more on this in a future post.</p> <p>Here’s the device in question. You place it on the ground, connect it via USB to your PC – where all being well it should be recognised as a joystick – and away you go: you place you feet on either side and can then not only tilt forwards/backwards and sideways (for pitch and roll, respectively) but rotate left and right, too (for yaw).</p> <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201bb0956b868970d-pi" target="_blank"><img title="The 3D Rudder" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 30px auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="The 3D Rudder" src="/assets/image_689445.jpg" width="500" height="281"></a></p> <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201bb0956b86c970d-pi" target="_blank"><img title="And its backside" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 30px auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="And its backside" src="/assets/image_816845.jpg" width="500" height="281"></a></p> <p>It takes a little while to “find your feet” (haha) but after that it’s fairly intuitive. I gave it a try, a few weeks ago, with the desktop version of Google Earth. I entered “flight simulator” mode and uses the 3D Rudder as a joystick to fly around, as shown (by someone else) in the below video:</p> <p align="center">&nbsp;</p> <p align="center"><iframe height="281" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/5f1BekHMRtg?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" width="500" allowfullscreen></iframe></p> <p align="center">&nbsp;</p> <p>It was an interesting experience. I’ve always been pretty bad at flight simulators – this didn’t do much to change that – but I could certainly see the potential for this style of user input device.</p> <p>Interestingly, while it was initially intended as a peripheral for design applications, the 3D Rudder also has the potential to help navigate in VR. It’s only really usable when seated, rather than at room-scale, of course.</p> <p>So when <a href="https://vr.google.com/earth/" target="_blank">Google Earth VR</a> was launched <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/348250/" target="_blank">on Steam</a> last week, my first thought was that it might be interesting to combine 3D Rudder and Google Earth VR. That didn’t end up being the case – at least I haven’t found a way to do it, as yet – but I did have an incredible time playing with Google Earth VR using the standard HTC Vive controllers.</p> <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b8d23d7ca4970c-pi" target="_blank"><img title="Welcome to Google Earth VR" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 30px auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="Welcome to Google Earth VR" src="/assets/image_290331.jpg" width="500" height="278"></a></p> <p>Google Earth VR is an amazing application. They’ve created a really compelling interface that allows you to navigate the planet in VR, and have really pushed the envelope when it comes to reducing cybersickness.</p> <p>Here’s a quick set of captures of me zooming into my home (everyone does this when they load Google Earth, right?).</p> <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b8d23d7cac970c-pi"><img title="Going home in Google Earth VR" style="float: none; margin: 30px auto; display: block" alt="Going home in Google Earth VR" src="/assets/image_686005.jpg" width="500" height="277"></a></p> <p>You’ll notice a grid appearing at the periphery of your vision when performing certain operations. This is completely deliberate: it’s not about performance, it’s about reducing your nausea. If you were fully immersed as you zoomed around at unrealistic speeds, your brain would soon believe something very unnatural was happening. I did end up feeling a little sick, myself, but I believe that was because I was regularly using Steam to snap screenshots for this post and every time I did so the view froze for a second.</p> <p>Another interesting aspect to the experience is that rather than flying way above the Earth – with a severe risk of vertigo – you are essentially scaled up and stomping around a smaller version of the planet. Which is great for those with a God(zilla) complex. :-)</p> <p>There is an option that allows you to zoom into human scale, but this has to be enabled manually, and you’re never really floating above the planet – it’s only when you get to a certain zoom factor that it kicks in. This was (once again) very well thought out.</p> <p>The last UX piece that I simply loved was the ability to grip the Sun using a controller and drag it across the sky to change the time of day. You can just see the arc of the Sun – which it won’t deviate from – as well as the blue outline of my VR area’s boundaries in the below screenshot. What an amazing way to perform sun studies!</p> <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b7c8b3b31e970b-pi" target="_blank"><img title="Grabbing the sun to adust the time" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 30px auto; border-left: 0px; display: block; padding-right: 0px" border="0" alt="Grabbing the sun to adust the time" src="/assets/image_711763.jpg" width="500" height="278"></a></p> <p>From beginning to end Google Earth VR was a sheer delight. Once again Google has broken serious ground dealing with a number of important VR usability questions. The VR industry really owes them a debt of gratitude.</p>
