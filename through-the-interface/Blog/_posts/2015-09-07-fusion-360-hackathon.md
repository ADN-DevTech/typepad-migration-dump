It’s running from September 23 to October 30, 2015, so a reasonable period during which you can create your first Fusion 360 app using JavaScript, Python or C++. I don’t know much about Fusion 360 development, but I’m looking forward to learning more during this event.</p>  <p>This is a great chance to start working early on with one of Autodesk’s hottest new platform technologies. And to get Autodesk not only to help you with your development, but also to compensate you for your efforts! (You can receive $500 if you submit your app to the <a href="https://apps.exchange.autodesk.com/FUSION/en/Home/Index" target="_blank">Autodesk Fusion App Store</a> during the Hackathon.)</p>  <p>For more information head along to the <a href="http://fusion360hackathon.com/" target="_blank">Fusion 360 Hackathon website</a>. As always with such events, do make sure <a href="http://fusion360hackathon.com/rules" target="_blank">you understand the rules</a>.</p>
