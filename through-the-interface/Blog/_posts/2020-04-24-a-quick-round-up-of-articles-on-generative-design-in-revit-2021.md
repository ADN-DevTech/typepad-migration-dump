<p>This week has been interesting: after speculating last week about <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2020/04/generatively-designing-a-post-covid-world.html" target="_blank">how the COVID-19 pandemic might change our design criteria</a> – especially as it might relate to Generative Design – this week I ended up diving into a project related to exactly that. I’ll share more on this in due course.</p><p>In the meantime, I thought I’d post a quick round-up of some news that has been coming in on the new Generative Design feature (formerly known as Project Refinery) in Revit 2021.</p><p>To start with, here’s <a href="https://adsknews.autodesk.com/news/generative-design-revit" target="_blank">a good article from Autodesk that announces the feature</a>.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4fef1e1200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="281" title="revit-2021-generative-design" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="revit-2021-generative-design" src="/assets/image_580717.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Next up, here’s a helpful video that walks through how it works.</p><p align="center"><br></p><p align="center"><iframe width="500" height="283" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/huKrX-thm24" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"></iframe></p><p><br></p><p>In terms of external coverage, I came across these two articles that may be of interest to people:</p><p><a href="https://architosh.com/2020/04/autodesk-intros-generative-design-inside-revit-2021-among-other-features/" target="_blank">Architosh: Autodesk Intros ‘Generative Design’ inside Revit 2021 Among Other Features</a></p><p><a href="https://www.archdaily.com/937772/how-will-generative-design-impact-architecture" target="_blank">ArchDaily: How Will Generative Design Impact Architecture?</a></p><p>In addition to focusing on GD-related tasks, this week, it was also the second official virtual Forge Accelerator (in reality it was the third, as the first was unofficial, having been planned to be in-person but eventually being held virtually when the Sydney office closed earlier on in the current crisis). I didn’t end up participating, this week, as fully as I might have – having been asked at short notice to devote time to this other activity – but I do want to spend a few words next week sharing my impressions of this new format. But more on that next week.</p>
