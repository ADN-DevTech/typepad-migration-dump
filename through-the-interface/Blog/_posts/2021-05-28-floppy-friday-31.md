<p><a href="https://youtu.be/xtDY9Tp9wyw" rel="noopener" target="_blank">This week’s episode</a> is longer than I expected, but I found I kept going on to the next game as the one before left me wanting more.</p>
<p>I would have loved to have played the first game – <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Who_Dares_Wins_II" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Who Dares Wins II</a> – for longer, but it crashed almost straightaway. One to come back to, at some point. (I mentioned its similarity to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commando_(video_game)" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Commando</a>: according to Wikipedia, the first Who Dares Wins was “given an injunction” for basically being a copy of Commando. Funny!) Here’s <a href="http://www.zzap64.co.uk/cgi-bin/displaypage.pl?issue=008&amp;page=128&amp;thumbstart=0&amp;magazine=zzap" rel="noopener" target="_blank">its review from Issue 8 of Zzap!64 magazine</a>:</p>

<p>The next game, <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/c64/fighting-warrior" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Fighting Warrior</a>, was hysterical, but mainly because I didn’t realise demo mode was engaged for most of my efforts. The fighting was somewhat bizarre, too.</p>

<p><a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eskimo_Games" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Eskimo Games</a> was frankly disappointing, but it’s a bit harsh to judge games like this on a single play.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.gb64.com/game.php?id=8045" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Tough Guys</a> was obviously a really bad fighting game, something I could tell even from a single play.</p>
<p>The final game was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basket_Master" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Basket Master</a>: by this stage I was really hoping for a basket-weaving “how to”, but it turned out to be yet another basketball game where I was beaten brutally (presumably by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernando_Mart%C3%ADn_(basketball)" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Fernando Martín</a>, the first Spaniard to play in the NBA). Most of this week’s games weren’t among the best I’ve played, but that’s the luck of the draw and I still had fun.</p>
