<p>It’s Friday, so it’s time to dig into a few old floppies for my old new Commodore 64. In this week’s episode we take a look at an image on the same floppy as Bubble Bobble – which we saw <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2020/11/floppy-friday-2.html" target="_blank">last week</a> – and then play <a href="https://csdb.dk/release/?id=103882" target="_blank">Artax</a> (and no, this doesn’t have anything to do with Atreyu’s horse from The NeverEnding Story), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Dangerous" target="_blank">Rick Dangerous</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zaxxon" target="_blank">Zaxxon</a>.</p><p align="center"><br></p><p align="center"><iframe width="500" height="283" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4mrU7OM7Bxs" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"></iframe></p><p><br></p><p>It’s Autodesk University next week, so I hope I’ll still find time to record one of these to be posted on Friday, but we’ll see. Once again, if you enjoy this content, please do post a comment via this blog or via social media. Or even <a href="http://www.youtube.com/c/KeanWalmsley" target="_blank">subscribe on YouTube</a>! There, I said it. Maybe I am a YouTuber, after all.</p>
