<p>Last week I was in Dallas, Texas, for TechX 2023, Autodesk’s annual internal event for technical and design staff.</p><p>As the technical content shared at the event is company confidential, I’m mostly sharing pictures of people I had the good fortune to hang out with, during the course of the week. There was quite a bit of “real” work going on, too, though, so hopefully you won’t come away with the impression that it was just a week-long party. Ahem.</p><p>As there’s no direct flight to Dallas from Switzerland, I chose to fly via Heathrow from Geneva on the Sunday morning.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202b7517ff264200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="The flight out to Heathrow" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="The flight out to Heathrow" src="/assets/image_926422.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>The onwards flight was operated by American Airlines, which meant a change of terminal from 5 to 3.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202b7517ff116200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Onwards to Dallas" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Onwards to Dallas" src="/assets/image_978387.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>There was plenty of time for the terminal change, though, as the flight to Dallas was delayed by a half-hour or so. The gate was heaving with passengers.</p><p><font color="#acb613"><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202b68536eb92200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Waiting at Heathrow" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Waiting at Heathrow" src="/assets/image_513832.jpg" border="0"></a></font></p><p>I was part of boarding group 7 (is it me, or is this group thing getting out of hand?), so was quite late to board. Luckily with still enough overhead space, as I really didn’t want to check a bag.</p><p>I felt a tap on my shoulder as I settled in – it turned out that Pete Meltzer, my Research Engineering colleague, was sitting across the aisle from me. This wouldn’t be surprising on a flight to AU – which are often full of people heading to the conference – but Pete was the only person I recognised on the flight. A fun coincidence!</p><p><font color="#acb613"><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202b7517ff11e200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Flying with Pete" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Flying with Pete" src="/assets/image_549094.jpg" border="0"></a></font></p><p>I was at the event a day early to attend our spring Architects Forum (for software architects, not real architects), so the Hilton Anatole was quite quiet when we arrived. The TechX registration desk was ready to go, though.</p><p><font color="#acb613"><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202b751a45421200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="The check-in" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="The check-in" src="/assets/image_859673.jpg" border="0"></a></font></p><p>On Monday evening I went with a few members of the Research Engineering team for some local food.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202b68536f052200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Tom, Liviu and Tony, ready for Ferris Wheelers" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Tom, Liviu and Tony, ready for Ferris Wheelers" src="/assets/image_702248.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Being a vegetarian, it was quite the experience seeing my colleagues demolish some good Texan BBQ.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202b7517ff5ee200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="375" height="500" title="Tom tucking into BBQ" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Tom tucking into BBQ" src="/assets/image_201742.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>I’d have been happier about the whole deal if my salad had been washed properly: I nearly lost a filling. But then I’m guessing they don’t sell a whole load of them.</p><p>The Hilton Anatole was possibly the nicest venue I can remember for a TechX. The hotel is full of Asian artwork and has a very clear focus on natural design elements.</p><p>Judging from the great, natural feel in the atrium, I’m almost certain that their architect worked with a biophilic design consultant.</p><p><font color="#acb613"><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202b68536f4b3200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="375" height="500" title="The Atrium" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="The Atrium" src="/assets/image_809173.jpg" border="0"></a></font></p><p>There was a fantastic outdoor area that was easily accessible from the conference area. What a change from Las Vegas, where I used to head to the <a href="https://www.venetianlasvegas.com/shops/grand-canal-shoppes.html" target="_blank">Grand Canal Shoppes</a> to feel like I was outside!</p><p><font color="#acb613"><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202b68536f3c6200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="501" height="375" title="Outdoors at the Hilton Anatole" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Outdoors at the Hilton Anatole" src="/assets/image_745731.jpg" border="0"></a></font></p><p>In fact the welcome reception – on the Tuesday night – was held in this outside area. It was so much fun to catch up with old friends.</p><p><font color="#acb613"><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202b7517ff12e200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Dale, Hali, Marta, Zoe, Dagmara and Kean" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Dale, Hali, Marta, Zoe, Dagmara and Kean" src="/assets/image_558216.jpg" border="0"></a></font></p><p>Jonathan Geffen is in our technical sales team in Barcelona (I’ve <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2019/05/meet-my-mentees.html" target="_blank">mentioned him before</a>), and this was his first time at TechX. I hope we see each other at more in the future!</p><p><font color="#acb613"><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202b7517ff132200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Catching up with Jonathan" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Catching up with Jonathan" src="/assets/image_868157.jpg" border="0"></a></font></p><p>There were professional photographers at the event… once registered in their system for a single photo, you’d get links to all other photos taken of you thanks to the magic of facial recognition. Kinda freaky.</p><p><font color="#acb613"><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202b68536ec93200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="333" title="Liviu, Alan, Raphael, Dagmara and Kean" style="margin: 30px auto;

I can’t talk about what I learned (for now), but Forma has since been released, in case you want to check it out.</p><p align="center"><br></p><p align="center"><font color="#acb613"><iframe width="500" height="283" title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6iKM0fsk_Jw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"></iframe></font></p><p><br></p><p>The flights back – once again via Heathrow to Geneva – were uneventful, although I didn’t manage to sleep much on the way.</p><p>Once home – at around 1pm – I napped for 90 minutes and then forced myself out of bed to walk the dog down by the lake. </p><p><font color="#acb613"><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202b751a45cea200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Getting over jetlag by the lake" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Getting over jetlag by the lake" src="/assets/image_917503.jpg" border="0"></a></font></p><p>It was just what I needed to start feeling restored.</p><p><font color="#acb613"><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202b751a458ed200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Walking the puppy" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Walking the puppy" src="/assets/image_197979.jpg" border="0"></a></font></p><p>It’s now Tuesday and I’m feeling pretty much back to normal. It was really nice seeing so many old friends during the course of the week in Dallas, aside from learning a lot about Autodesk’s various technological endeavours.</p>
