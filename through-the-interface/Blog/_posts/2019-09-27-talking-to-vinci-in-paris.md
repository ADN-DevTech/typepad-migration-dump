<p>After a quick trip to Zurich on Tuesday, on Wednesday I took the train to Paris. I’d booked a hotel that was convenient for our Paris office, and walked there from la Gare de Lyon through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parc_de_Bercy" target="_blank">le Parc de Bercy</a>.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4b28fd2200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Sculpture in Bercy Park - I think it has a face" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Sculpture in Bercy Park - I think it has a face" src="/assets/image_732066.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>I’d made tentative plans to meet up with friends in the evening, but as they had to cancel (for excellent reasons) I ended up wandering around <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bercy_Village" target="_blank">Bercy Village</a> to get a quick bite to eat. I’m mostly a people person, but I have to admit that having the occasional evening to myself is bit of a treat. (I’ll be back again in Paris for two nights next week and so will hopefully be able to catch up with my friends then.)</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4b28fda200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="375" height="500" title="Bercy Village by night" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Bercy Village by night" src="/assets/image_570029.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>In the morning I crossed the Seine to get to Autodesk’s Paris office. I was there to present an introduction to the work Autodesk Research has done around generative design to people from various parts of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinci_SA" target="_blank">VINCI</a>, a very important customer of ours. It was part of a workshop organised by Roméo Sanches, our Customer Success Manager who works with VINCI. (Thanks to Roméo for providing the below two photos!)</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4b28fe2200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="257" title="Presenting to VINCI on GD" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Presenting to VINCI on GD" src="/assets/image_205839.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>I talked for about 90 minutes about our various projects, as well as the tools Autodesk has made available to apply generative design in the AEC space.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4893bf2200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="427" height="450" title="What is it with the hands?" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="What is it with the hands?" src="/assets/image_960703.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Emmanuel Lagardette from our Consulting team delivered the second half of the workshop, focusing on more practical aspects of implementing GD workflows.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4b28fea200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Emmanuel presenting" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Emmanuel presenting" src="/assets/image_125782.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>I had a relatively early train home, so had to leave before the meeting was finished. I walked across the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passerelle_Simone-de-Beauvoir" target="_blank">Passerelle Simone-de-Beauvoir</a> – a very interesting footbridge – to get back across the Seine towards la Gare de Lyon.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4b28ff2200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="The Passerelle Simone-de-Beauvoir" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="The Passerelle Simone-de-Beauvoir" src="/assets/image_267234.jpg" border="0"></a><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4893bfe200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="The view along the footbridge" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="The view along the footbridge" src="/assets/image_288820.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>I’d been asked to join a 2-day internal workshop in Boston starting yesterday, but couldn’t travel there (of course) due to the VINCI meeting. As it was I was able to call in from the train (or I should say trains, as I somehow ended up having to take four of them) and then from home for the full working day Eastern time (which meant from 3pm to 11pm, locally). A loooong day.</p><p>When I first joined the call the Zoom system somehow had me up on the screens in the conference room in stereo (although not 3D, unfortunately ;-). Here’s a pic of me on the TGV one of the physical attendees shared.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4d71c5b200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Digital Twins" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Digital Twins" src="/assets/image_586214.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>I’ll be joining the call again at 3pm, but have a few other meetings between now and then. This weekend is our annual <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/F%C3%AAte_des_vendanges_de_Neuch%C3%A2tel" target="_blank">wine festival</a> in Neuchatel, so I’ll have ample opportunity to unwind at the end of this busy week.</p>
