<p>In <a href="https://youtu.be/ClDcQebgAUI" rel="noopener" target="_blank">this week’s episode</a> we mostly played <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Games_II" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Summer Games II</a>. It’s not exactly how I expected things to turn out, but there you go. It’s also a game I’d already played back in <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2021/06/floppy-friday-32.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Floppy Friday #32</a> – I knew it looked familiar! (sigh) – but I chose a different set of disciplines to be awful at. Apart from the javelin, as I seem to love failing at that one. I’m pretty sure I fluffed selecting nationalities in exactly the same way, too, but hey.</p>
<p>We did get a little time to play a couple of other games – <a href="https://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=527" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Commando Libya</a> and <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/street-surfer" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Street Surfer</a>, neither of which were major hits – and then failed to load a few others. But I had fun!</p>
