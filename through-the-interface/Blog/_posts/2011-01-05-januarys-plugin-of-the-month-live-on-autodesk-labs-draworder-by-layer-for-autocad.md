<p>As <a href="http://labs.blogs.com/its_alive_in_the_lab/2011/01/january-adn-plugin-of-the-month-draw-order-by-layer-for-autocad-now-available.html" target="_blank">Scott has announced over on his blog</a>, January’s Plugin of the Month, DrawOrder By Layer, is now <a href="http://labs.autodesk.com/utilities/adn_plugins/" target="_blank">available on Autodesk Labs</a>. I first posted the code for this very useful plugin <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2010/10/changing-the-relative-draw-order-of-autocad-objects-based-on-their-layer.html" target="_blank">back in October</a>, and this version includes only a very minor change from that one (for performance reasons it now only works with modelspace layers).</p>  <p>A huge thanks to Terry Dotson from <a href="http://www.dotsoft.com/" target="_blank">DotSoft</a> for generously donating this plugin.</p>  <p>After the original post, a few people provided feedback on user interface enhancements they’d like to see in the tool – thanks for taking the time to do so, those of you who did – but for this release the user interface has been left as it was: as usual the plugin is provided with full source-code, should you wish to go ahead and implement more advanced capabilities (multiple reordering/drag &amp; drop/etc.).</p>  <p>Enjoy! :-)</p>
