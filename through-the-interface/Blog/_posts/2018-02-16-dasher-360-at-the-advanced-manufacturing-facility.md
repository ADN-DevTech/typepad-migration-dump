<p>During a 3-day event, this week, Autodesk opened its Advanced Manufacturing Facility (AMF) in Birmingham, the UK’s second largest city. Here’s a video showing some information about this very cool facility.</p>

<p>It’s one of <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/technology-centers" target="_blank">6 technology centres</a> that Autodesk is running at various locations around the world. The others are <a href="https://technologycenters.autodesk.com/locations/pier9/" target="_blank">Pier 9 in San Francisco</a>, the <a href="https://technologycenters.autodesk.com/locations/build-space/" target="_blank">Boston BUILD Space</a>, <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/toronto" target="_blank">Autodesk Toronto’s new MaRS office</a>, the VR Center in Munich and the <a href="https://technologycenters.autodesk.com/locations/materials-lab/" target="_blank">Materials Lab in Kilsyth, Australia</a>.</p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b7c950846e970b-pi"><img width="500" height="370" title="Autodesk Technology Centers" style="margin: 30px auto; float: none; display: block;" alt="Autodesk Technology Centers" src="/assets/image_227089.jpg"></a></p><p>My team is proud to have been asked to provide technology to be showcased at the AMF: <a href="http://dasher360.com" target="_blank">Dasher 360</a> is running there, providing access to sensor data via a “digital twin” of the workshop.</p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b8d2daf144970c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="312" title="Dasher 360 view of the AMF in Birmingham" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Dasher 360 view of the AMF in Birmingham" src="/assets/image_830973.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>This is just an initial implementation, though: our plan is to get really serious about the visualisation of data being captured at the AMF, integrating it for display onto the virtual robots. The kind of thing we hinted at in <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2017/10/dasher-360-at-autodesk-university-and-the-forge-devcon.html" target="_blank">this previous post</a>. That will be <em>really</em> cool.</p>
