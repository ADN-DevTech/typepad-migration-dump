<p>I’m back from our 2-week summer break, which we spent this year in Switzerland and Germany.</p><p>The majority of the first week was spent up in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernese_Oberland" target="_blank">Bernese Oberland</a>, a region we enjoy immensely. We were there all together – I was with my wife and our three kids – but in the mornings the “grown ups” left the kids to sleep in while we walked up to the centre of Adelboden.</p><p>This was partly to give our puppy, Daisy, a bit of exercise…</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202a30d487d1b200b-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="Nibbling a pine cone" border="0" height="500" src="/assets/image_429675.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="Nibbling a pine cone" width="500" /></a></p><p>… but also because we love having a quiet breakfast at <a href="https://www.haueter-adelboden.ch/" target="_blank">Haueter</a>, considered one of the best bakeries in Switzerland.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202a308db1645200c-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="Breakfast at Haueter" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_322061.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="Breakfast at Haueter" width="500" /></a></p><p>Aside from our walks into town, we spent a couple of afternoons at <a href="https://engstligenalp.ch/" target="_blank">Engstligenalp</a>. The first day we just walked to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engstligen_Falls" target="_blank">the Engtsligen Falls</a>…</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202a308db164c200c-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="Engstligenfalle" border="0" height="500" src="/assets/image_904370.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="Engstligenfalle" width="375" /></a></p><p>… while the second day was spent on top, where we could introduce Daisy to some different kinds of animal.</p><p>There were goats:</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202a308db167d200c-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="Goats" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_602610.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="Goats" width="500" /></a></p><p>In fact lots of goats!</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202a2eed11c1d200d-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="More goats" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_326046.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="More goats" width="500" /></a></p><p>And she also got to meet her first cow.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202a2eed11be7200d-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="Daisy meets her first cow" border="0" height="500" src="/assets/image_53602.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="Daisy meets her first cow" width="375" /></a></p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engstligenalp" target="_blank">Engstligenalp</a> is really a special place, both in summer and winter. We love going up there.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202a30d487d34200b-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="Puppy and goats" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_846423.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="Puppy and goats" width="500" /></a></p><p>After coming home for the weekend, I went with Zephyr, our second son (and a middle child, like me) for a few days of hiking in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valais" target="_blank">Valais</a> (a higher part of the Alps). The main goal of this second week – for me at least – was to have some special time with Zephyr. (Our eldest is going on a diving holiday with his Mum once the others are back in school, and our youngest has her puppy to look after.)</p><p>We took trains to Lausanne, then Martigny and Riddes, and then the bus up to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovronnaz" target="_blank">Ovronnaz</a>.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202a30d487d78200b-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="The view from the train across Lake Leman" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_604935.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="The view from the train across Lake Leman" width="500" /></a></p><p>Our plan was to hike from Ovronnaz – which is at about 1,200m of altitude – to <a href="https://cas-diablerets.ch/cabanes/cabane-rambert/" target="_blank">la Cabane Rambert</a> at nearly 2,600m.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202a30d487d7c200b-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="Walking across a plateau" border="0" height="241" src="/assets/image_137108.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="Walking across a plateau" width="500" /></a></p><p>It was a pretty steady uphill slog which took us around 4 hours. This particular hike had been recommended by my old friend and colleague <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2018/03/celebrating-a-20-year-journey.html" target="_blank">John Goodman</a>, who had done it a few months before. Thanks, John!</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202a308db16eb200c-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="Still feeling fresh" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_954776.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="Still feeling fresh" width="500" /></a></p><p>The views were spectacular, but one of the best was the one of the cabin itself. By this point I felt I could not have walked any further!</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202a30d487e8f200b-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="La Cabane Rambert" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_509625.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="La Cabane Rambert" width="500" /></a></p><p>Here’s the hike details in the <a href="https://www.swisstopo.admin.ch/" target="_blank">Swisstopo</a> app:</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202a30d489b0e200b-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="The hike stats" border="0" height="700" src="/assets/image_829199.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="The hike stats" width="332" /></a></p><p>As you can see, I was a lot less fresh than my son on our arrival.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202a308db1682200c-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="Feeling less fresh" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_571648.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="Feeling less fresh" width="500" /></a></p><p>Once I’d dried out I could enjoy the views from the top a little more.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202a2eed11c0b200d-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="Feeling salty" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_210715.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="Feeling salty" width="500" /></a></p><p>And they were absolutely amazing. Here’s a panorama with Zephyr and the cabin.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202a30d487d4a200b-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="The cabin and its view" border="0" height="161" src="/assets/image_585528.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="The cabin and its view" width="500" /></a></p><p>Here’s another that highlights <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mountains_of_Valais" target="_blank">la Pointe de Chemo</a>, a significant local landmark.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202a308db16fe200c-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="The view from the cabin" border="0" height="118" src="/assets/image_2750.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="The view from the cabin" width="500" /></a></p><p>It was also very visible in the common eating area.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202a30d487d58200b-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="The common space" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_428558.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="The common space" width="500" /></a></p><p>Here’s a photo that was on the wall showing a previous incarnation of this cabin.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202a308db1795200c-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="An old photo of our cabin" border="0" height="500" src="/assets/image_123514.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="An old photo of our cabin" width="375" /></a></p><p>Here’s a page from a book (in French) that describes the renovations that have been made to this historic building over the years.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202a30d487dfa200b-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="Some information on the cabin&#39;s renovation" border="0" height="500" src="/assets/image_968764.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="Some information on the cabin&#39;s renovation" width="415" /></a></p><p>This was our first time staying over in a mountain cabin, so a lot of things were new. For dinner we were seated with people who were assigned to the same room as us.</p><p>It was a great way to break the ice, I found. We ate with a family of 4 and a couple of young women who all live in the Lausanne area. They were all very nice.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202a30d487dfe200b-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="Our table" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_266800.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="Our table" width="500" /></a></p><p>Our room, which slept 8 people, was named after la Pointe de Chemo itself.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202a308db16ca200c-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="Our room" border="0" height="500" src="/assets/image_502563.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="Our room" width="375" /></a></p><p>The beds were comfortable: my son nabbed a single bed while I was on the bottom of a triple bunk. Between these were two bunk-beds placed next to each other, which works well for families. All in all very cosy. I was happy to have ear plugs.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202a308db1654200c-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="Beds in our room" border="0" height="500" src="/assets/image_750881.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="Beds in our room" width="375" /></a></p><p>The buffet breakfast was served in the morning between 6:30 and 7:30am. Once we’d eaten we started back down the same trail as we’d taken on the way up.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202a30d487d84200b-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="Walking" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_581611.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="Walking" width="500" /></a></p><p>If anything the views were even more spectacular, this way.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202a30d487ce6200b-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="About to descend" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_821013.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="About to descend" width="500" /></a></p><p>It wasn’t easy going, to be honest: by the time we reached Ovronnaz I was in quite a bit of pain. But the pay-off was a 3-hour dip in <a href="https://www.bains-ovronnaz.ch/en/" target="_blank">the thermal baths</a>, which felt amazing.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202a2eed11bed200d-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="At the baths" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_589311.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="At the baths" width="500" /></a></p><p>We were back home on Tuesday night, where we could pack – and relax for the full day on Wednesday – before Zephyr and I headed across on Thursday morning to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich" target="_blank">Munich</a> for a city break to complement our mountain one.</p><p>We took the train to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z%C3%BCrich" target="_blank">Zurich</a> and the 4-hour FlixBus from there to downtown Munich. We stayed with an old friend of ours who lives very close to the city centre.</p><p>To stretch our legs on arrival, we wandered around the local neighbourhood. Munich has some lovely green areas which really help with the summer heat.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202a30d487d88200b-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="The cemetry" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_176579.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="The cemetry" width="500" /></a></p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202a30d487cef200b-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="A small river" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_595621.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="A small river" width="500" /></a></p><p>During the summer people flock to the bank of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isar" target="_blank">Isar</a> river.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202a2eed11c82200d-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="The Isar river" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_316002.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="The Isar river" width="500" /></a></p><p>Our plan for the evening was to see <a href="https://www.munich2022.com/en/festival-programme#/event/m-nchner-symphoniker-oimara-presented-by-stadtsparkasse-m-nchen--d1_central_1" target="_blank">the Munich Symphony at Olympiapark</a>. This was an event for the <a href="https://www.munich2022.com/en" target="_blank">European Championships</a> that had opened the day before.</p><p>Part of the city’s goal of hosting some European Championship events was apparently to highlight the value of hosting an event such as the Olympics: it seems very little (or no) additional infrastructure was required from when Munich hosted the <a href="https://olympics.com/en/" target="_blank">Olympic Games</a> back in 1972!</p><p>Here’s the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympiastadion_(Munich)" target="_blank">Olympic stadium</a> with its amazing roof.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202a30d487e85200b-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="The Olympic stadium" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_464749.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="The Olympic stadium" width="500" /></a></p><p>We sat on the grass and enjoyed the concert with a number of friends (mostly former Autodeskers who lived in Neuchatel, back in the day). It was really nice.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202a308db1804200c-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="The concert in the Olympiapark" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_616594.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="The concert in the Olympiapark" width="500" /></a></p><p>As the sun went down the lights of the various installations really shone.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202a2eed11c92200d-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="The Olympiapark by night" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_124486.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="The Olympiapark by night" width="500" /></a></p><p>One such installation was an LED-based light tunnel that people could walk through.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202a308db1691200c-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="LED tunnel" height="500" src="/assets/image_404064.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; float: none; display: block;" title="LED tunnel" width="500" /></a></p><p>Heading home afterwards we took the U-bahn from the stop right next to <a href="https://www.bmw-welt.com/en.html" target="_blank">BMW Welt</a>. I would have liked to have visited the museum during this trip, but we ended up doing other things instead. I’m sure we’ll get the chance on another trip.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202a2eed11d42200d-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="BMW Welt by night" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_535183.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="BMW Welt by night" width="500" /></a></p><p>One of the friends we’d met for the concert used to be an avid climber, so suggested meeting up again for the qualifiers of the climbing event at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%B6nigsplatz,_Munich" target="_blank">Königsplatz</a> the following day.</p><p>I’m pretty far from being a climber – I have a solid fear of heights (or rather, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/867045-tiffany-was-not-afraid-of-heights-at-all-she-could" target="_blank">as Terry Pratchett once wrote</a>, depths) – but the event was absolutely fascinating. We were right by the foot of the climbing wall for the men’s lead event, standing next to competitors scoping it out and planning their routes up.

I wasn’t specifically looking for Swiss food while in Munich, but as I don’t eat meat I did find the Gruyere sandwich to be a very good option.<a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202a2eed11bf5200d-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="A Gruyere sandwich for lunch" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_75190.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="A Gruyere sandwich for lunch" width="500" /></a></p><p>After lunch we headed back to the wall, but stood this time with a more direct view: by this point the women’s boulder qualifiers had started, and this spot meant we could watch both.<p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202a2eed11c0f200d-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="From the front" border="0" height="500" src="/assets/image_950825.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="From the front" width="375" /></a></p></p><p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202a308db169a200c-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="Falling" border="0" height="500" src="/assets/image_884608.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="Falling" width="375" /></a></p></p><p>It was so much fun that we decided to meet back again the following day towards the end of the afternoon to watch the finals of the women’s lead and the men’s boulder events.</p><p>Beforehand, though, Zephyr and I visited the city a little, mainly to visit a few shops. We passed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marienplatz" target="_blank">Marienplatz</a>, where we could appreciate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Town_Hall_(Munich)" target="_blank">the New Town Hall</a>.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202a308db16ce200c-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="Munich cathedral" border="0" height="500" src="/assets/image_831606.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="Munich cathedral" width="375" /></a></p><p>We visited an interesting <a href="https://picknweight.de/pages/munich" target="_blank">“pay by weight” secondhand shop</a>, which was colourful if not exactly full of bargains.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202a308db16d2200c-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="Old Cons" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_929186.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="Old Cons" width="500" /></a></p><p>During the afternoon on Saturday we headed back to Königsplatz.</p><p>What we hadn’t realised was – unlike the day before – for the semis and finals you had to buy tickets, and these were sold out.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202a2eed11c25200d-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="No tickets for the finals on Day 3" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_870953.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="No tickets for the finals on Day 3" width="500" /></a></p><p>When we first arrived – during the women’s lead finals – there was no way to see any very much, so we sat in the adjacent biergarten and caught the odd glimpse of the better competitors reaching the top of the wall.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202a308db174c200c-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="The crowd watching the climbing from outside" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_330762.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="The crowd watching the climbing from outside" width="500" /></a></p><p>The crowds thinned out for the men’s boulder final, so we did get to peer through security and watch some of that, which was fun.<a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202a308db1752200c-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="Watching the mens boulder final" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_511123.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="Watching the mens boulder final" width="500" /></a></p><p>It was lovely catching up with old friends during the weekend. Here’s a dinner we shared with Petra and Marion at <a href="https://fugazi.pizza/" target="_blank">Fugazi</a> – a favourite spot of <a href="https://twitter.com/PeterSchlipf" target="_blank">Peter Schlipf</a>’s.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202a308db1661200c-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="At Fugazi" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_822693.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="At Fugazi" width="500" /></a></p><p>On Sunday we headed home after a very enjoyable time in Munich. I hadn’t spent much energy planning the weekend, but it ended up being a great experience anyway.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202a30d487e6a200b-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="Taking the U-bahn" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_848008.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="Taking the U-bahn" width="500" /></a></p><p>I often visit Munich for work, and it was really enjoyable to get to see it from a different perspective. It’s truly a lovely city.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202a30d487d4e200b-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="Taking the bus home" border="0" height="500" src="/assets/image_847912.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="Taking the bus home" width="375" /></a></p><p>On arriving home, we were met halfway between our place and the station by my daughter and her new puppy. And yes, my son did remove his new trainers to avoid getting them covered in “happy pee” (which turned out to be rather smart of him).</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202a30d488179200b-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="Welcome home" border="0" height="500" src="/assets/image_54585.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="Welcome home" width="375" /></a></p><p>Anyway, I’m back in the saddle, fully recharged, and we’re now ramping our efforts to execute on a <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2022/06/my-new-role-at-autodesk-research.html" target="_blank">new research direction</a> into high gear. More on that in an upcoming post!</p>
