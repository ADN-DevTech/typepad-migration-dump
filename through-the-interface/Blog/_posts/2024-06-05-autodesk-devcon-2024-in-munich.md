<p>A full week has now passed since more than 500 people were in Munich for the Autodesk DevCon 2024, and yet I&#39;m only now finding time to put proverbial pen to paper. It&#39;s just been really busy, but I&#39;ll talk more about why at some point in a future post.</p>
<p>For this year&#39;s event I opted to take the train from Neuchatel to Zurich and then from there on to Munich. In theory that&#39;s 5.5 hours from city to city, but that&#39;s not really accounting for delays due to the unreliable Deutsche-Bahn network. (That&#39;s not me being all “Swiss”about things... Germans are the first to complain about the state of rail in their country.)</p>
<p>Interestingly the initial delays/rerouting happened on the Swiss side, as there’d been a landslide in the St Gallen region. The joys of living in a 3D environment, I suppose (these things never happened when I was growing up in the (very flat) East of England). Anyway, the 30-minute buffer I had to change trains in Zurich ended up getting absorbed by taking my first train all the way through to St Gallen and hopping on a replacement bus service to St Margarethen, where I could pick up the train I was suppose to be taking from Zurich. I arrived in St Margarethen with 15 minutes to spare, so only arrived in Munich 40 minutes later than expected thanks to the DB-delay.<a href="/assets/image_483108.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Getting the train in St Margrethen." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_483108.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Getting the train in St Margrethen" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>When I arrived in Munich it was still dry, but that soon changed. I popped by a friend’s place - Petra lives walking distance from the main station - and we headed together to a lovely <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meze" rel="noopener" target="_blank">meze</a> restaurant called <a href="https://www.dasmaria.de" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Das Maria</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_306579.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_306579.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Lights" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>I love falafel even when it’s overcooked and dry and theirs was cooked to perfection.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_437569.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_437569.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="So good" width="500" /></a>It was lovely catching up with Petra, although the heavens opened as we walked back so we both got a little soggy, to say the least.<a href="/assets/image_91921.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Kean and Petra." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_91921.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Kean and Petra" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>I was wet and cold by the time I got to the Best Western in Arabellapark, which was more comfortable than I’d expected. It even had a nice chalet-style theme, which made me feel quite at home.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_806277.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Chalet-style rooms in the Best Western." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_806277.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Chalet-style rooms in the Best Western" width="500" /></a>The first day of the DevCon started with a general session.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_829210.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Day 1 General Session." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_829210.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Day 1 General Session" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Ben Cochran kicked things off, introducing the event and its focus on data.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_692572.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Ben Cochran." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_692572.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Ben Cochran" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Shelly Mujtaba took to the stage next.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_717431.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Shelly Mujtaba." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_717431.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Shelly Mujtaba" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>He talked about the various pillars of our data strategy.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_52036.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Data data data." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_52036.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Data data data" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>He also provided handy QR code links to the various data roadmaps, which you should be able to scan and check out yourselves.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_382645.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Roadmaps roadmaps roadmaps." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_382645.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Roadmaps roadmaps roadmaps" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Tulika Gang was next, and she covered a lot of detailed information about the Autodesk Platform.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_79607.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Tulika Garg." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_79607.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Tulika Garg" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>It&#39;s always good to see C# SDKs continue to be prioritised, even if I tend not to be using .NET myself, these days.<a href="/assets/image_733392.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_733392.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="SDKs" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>The priorities for developing the Viewer make a lot of sense to me.&#0160;</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_570333.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Viewer priorities." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_570333.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Viewer priorities" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>And there was summary of what’s here and what’s coming with data access.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_545485.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Today and tomorrow." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_545485.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Today and tomorrow" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>My team is working a lot with Forma, these days, and I’m very invested in seeing what comes out of the bottom item in the “later” list. Interesting times!</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_271270.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Forma roadmap." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_271270.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Forma roadmap" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>After years of working on Project Dasher, I love seeing the investments the Tandem team is making to simplify building high-quality, connected digital twins.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_750449.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Tandem Connect." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_750449.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Tandem Connect" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>I’m impatient to be able to build extensions that work with Tandem, but the JavaScript SDK for embedding the viewer is a good near-term compromise for developers.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_258830.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Tandem API roadmap." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_258830.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Tandem API roadmap" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Here’s a photo the event photographer took at the end of the general session. I was having a nice chat with Susanna Holt when we became aware we had a camera pointed at us. I think that’s what we were laughing about.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_887103.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Kean and Susanna." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_887103.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Kean and Susanna.jpg" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>There were a few folks present from Esri, including my old friend Philippe Leefsma.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_159594.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Kean and Philippe." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_159594.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Kean and Philippe" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>It was great that time was left between sessions for people to chat. These interactions are a really valuable part of the DevCon experience.<a href="/assets/image_777993.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Between floors." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_777993.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Between floors" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Every event needs an Autobear. In hindsight I should have made sure there was a human standing next to it for scale - it was big - but anyway.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_387737.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" height="500" src="/assets/image_387737.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Autobear" width="375" /></a></p>
<p>Outside of the general sessions the agenda had 3 or 4 simultaneous breakouts in each timeslot, so I was only able to attend a quarter or so of the sessions (in fact way less than that). I know recordings were made by some presenters, so I&#39;m hopefully there&#39;ll be a way to catch up on the great material even the most avid attendees ended up having to miss.</p>
<p>The first breakout I popped into was around data. As the DevCon was oversubscribed, Autodesk employees had been asked to let external guests sit before taking a seat themselves - which makes complete sense - but this did mean that I often sat around the edge of the most popular sessions.<a href="/assets/image_532270.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Data deep dive." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_532270.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Data deep dive" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Krzysztof Jedrzejewski and Håkon Dissen from the Forma team talked in more depth about what&#39;s happening there.<a href="/assets/image_363254.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Friends from Forma." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_363254.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Friends from Forma" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>It was great to see our friends from Plex-Earth getting a shout-out (as I suppose I&#39;m doing now ;-).<a href="/assets/image_58062.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Forma &lt;3 Plex-Earth." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_58062.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Forma &lt;3 Plex-Earth" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Josha van Reij talked in an another session about how Arcadis is using AI. Another packed room, so unfortunately I didn’t stay around for this one.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_304629.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Josha van Reij from Arcadis." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_304629.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Josha van Reij from Arcadis" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Michael Beale presented a number of samples focused on data. Michael and Petr Broz had something like 8 sessions each at this DevCon - and every one was very well prepared and delivered. These two are heroes.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_356750.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="QR codes for data-centric sample code." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_356750.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="QR codes for data-centric sample code" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>My team-mate Tomas came down from Bonn for the event. We had to join an important call during the afternoon where we shared some of our research with internal stakeholders: the organisers generously placed us in this room. After an hour in there everything I looked at outside the room was blue.<a href="/assets/image_781493.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Tomas in the very yellow room." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_781493.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Tomas in the very yellow room" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>This was one of the nicer breakout rooms, I found, with lots of natural light. The first session I attended here was from Petr and Michael who talked about harnessing AI to render scenes from the APS Viewer, using 3D information such as normal vectors to get amazing results. Really cool stuff.<a href="/assets/image_97082.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="AI rendering an APS Viewer scene." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_97082.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="AI rendering an APS Viewer scene" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>In the evening we were bussed across to the Bamberger Haus - one of Munich’s many beer gardens - for the social event.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_198228.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Mona, Lukas and Cyrille." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_198228.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Mona, Lukas and Cyrille" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>I really enjoyed catching up with so many old friends.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_439624.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Dinner at the Bamberger Haus." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_439624.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Dinner at the Bamberger Haus" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>And yes, things moved back to one of the hotel bars in Arabellapark. I wasn&#39;t planning to stay out late, but that&#39;s often the way these things go. Thanks to Jakub Bielski from SOFiSTiK for sharing this photo!<a href="/assets/image_223841.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="One for the road." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_223841.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="One for the road" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>The second day kicked off with another general session. This one I attended from the back, so my photos aren’t as clear.</p>
<p>Shelly hosted a panel session with a couple of our customers who use APS.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_768317.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Customer panel." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_768317.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Customer panel" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Then Susanna Holt took to the stage. She shared a lot of very interesting information - the fact she speaks German and loves white asparagus (which is currently in season) for starters.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_508036.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Susanna Holt." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_508036.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Susanna Holt" width="500" /></a>It’s great to see some numbers showing the continued strength of Autodesk developer community. (Who I very much think of as “my people”.)</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_271442.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="A strong community." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_271442.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="A strong community" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>The only business-focused session I attended during the DevCon was by Emil Kfouri, who talked in a very sensible way the best way to use Agile and Lean during your product development.<a href="/assets/image_167676.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Emil Kfouri talks Agile and Lean." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_167676.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Emil Kfouri talks Agile and Lean" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Petr and Michael talked about the history - and future - of connecting APS with PowerBI.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_578461.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="The Petr and Michael Show." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_578461.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="The Petr and Michael Show" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>The outdoor space brought some welcome relief for folks between sessions in a jam-packed agenda.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_922951.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="The outside space." border="0" height="500" src="/assets/image_922951.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="The outside space" width="375" /></a></p>
<p>Adam Nagy and Aditi Khedkar talked about the MFG Data Model.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_37576.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Adam and Aditi talking MFG Data Model." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_37576.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Adam and Aditi talking MFG Data Model" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Another session that was after my own heart was a customer session about building digital twins using APS.<a href="/assets/image_661185.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Digital Twin partners." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_661185.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Digital Twin partners" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>My DevCon wrapped up with another Lebanese dinner with the APS staff who made the magic happen at this year’s DevCon. They really did an incredible job.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_89921.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Dinner with the APS team." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_89921.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Dinner with the APS team" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>The next morning I left the hotel before 6am to get to the main station to take the first train home.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_503550.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="An early train home." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_503550.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="An early train home" width="500" /></a>It was fun to see both the departure...</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_943159.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="From Munich..." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_943159.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="From Munich..." width="500" /></a></p>
<p>… and destination cities painted on the train.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_722278.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_722278.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="To Zurich" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Leaving so early actually meant the train was only 10 minutes late arriving in Zurich, which meant I could get my connection easily and arriving home at around 1pm.</p>
<p>It was such a great event - I really love attending DevCon. And thanks to everyone who said “hi”. Many talked about how this blog (particularly in the early days, admittedly) has helped them solve technical challenges and ultimately benefited their careers. This is the kind of feedback that keeps me motivated when I get back to my desk and dig into the less fun aspects of my job. Thank you all for that.</p>
<p>If you want to hear more about the DevCon, I recommend this great recap video from my colleague Lejla Secerbegovic.</p>
