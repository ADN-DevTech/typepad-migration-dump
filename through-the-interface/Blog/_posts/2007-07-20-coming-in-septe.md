<p>I’m really excited about two new events we’re holding in September: an AEC DevCamp in Boston and a Manufacturing DevCamp in Portland. These are 3-day API-oriented workshops at locations close to our product development centres in Massachusetts (for AEC) and Oregon (for Manufacturing). Various members of my team and of our Engineering teams will be presenting introductory and in-depth sessions on the APIs for our industry-focused products.</p>

<p>This is a great opportunity to improve your technical knowledge of the APIs to our AEC products (the focus being AutoCAD Civil 3D, Revit Architecture/Structure/MEP and AutoCAD Architecture/MEP) or Manufacturing products (Inventor, AutoCAD Mechanical, AutoCAD Electrical, Vault and Productstream) and to meet members of the teams that develop them. If you go to the registration sites below you can access a detailed agenda for each event.</p>

<p>The conferences are open for anyone to attend: being a member of ADN is not a requirement, although you should have an interest in developing with or customizing our products, or in understanding their customization potential. There is a fee associated with attending: $495 if you register before July 29 (the “early bird” discounted price), or $595 if you register later. This fee covers all training and evening events, but no travel or accommodation.</p>

<p>Here are the dates &amp; locations, and links to register:</p>
