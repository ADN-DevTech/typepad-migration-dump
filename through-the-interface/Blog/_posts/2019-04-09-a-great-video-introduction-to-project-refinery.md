Very cool.</p><p>I’m hoping Jacqueline will find the time to take a look at <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2019/03/the-space-analysis-package-for-dynamo-and-refinery-is-now-available.html" target="_blank">our Space Analysis package for Dynamo</a> and post a video on getting started with it: I’d love to see Jacqueline’s thoughts on the package, delivered in her own unique style.</p><p>In the meantime, I’m going to post some information on getting started with the Space Analysis package, later this week.</p>
