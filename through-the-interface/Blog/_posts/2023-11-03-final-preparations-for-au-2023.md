<p>On Wednesday I’ll be flying out to San Francisco for some meetings ahead of Autodesk University 2023 in Las Vegas. It’ll actually be quite nice not to be completely jet-lagged for the first two days of the conference - although as my first class is at 8am on Monday morning it wouldn’t be the worst thing to be a bit jet-lagged, honestly.</p>
<p>Things are coming together, although there’s still some work to be done: <a href="https://thebentway.ca/event/from-steps-to-stories/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">From Steps to Stories</a> is debuting tonight in Toronto, so we’ll have a good sense of any issues with the larger-scale exhibit ahead of it coming to Vegas.</p>
<p>Here’s another sneak peek of some of what you can expect to see. It’s going to be great! (Remember: come find us at Booth #1222, it’s nice and easy to remember.)</p>

<p>We’ve ordered some fun goodies to give to participants, i.e. people who don a special headset and wander around the Expo capturing data for 20-30 minutes. Hopefully everything will arrive properly at the Expo, as planned.</p>
<p>For my two classes, the recordings are ready and the handouts submitted.</p>
<p>Here’s a 100x summary of the two classes. Firstly, the “sold out” <a href="https://conferences.autodesk.com/flow/autodesk/au2023/sessioncatalog/page/inperson/session/1686766044586001Z9UY" rel="noopener" target="_blank">VASA class</a> that’s on Monday November 11th:</p>

<p>Secondly, the “still plenty of space” <a href="https://conferences.autodesk.com/flow/autodesk/au2023/sessioncatalog/page/inperson/session/1686766247767001Zgix" rel="noopener" target="_blank">class on Smart Infrastructure</a> that’s on Wednesday November 13th:</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Something else I’m really excited about: during the week I’ll be heading across to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere_%28venue%29" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the Sphere</a> (more on that in this blog). While I’m there, I’m planning to pitch a special exhibit that I’ve put together specially for that amazing venue. Here’s a mock-up that gives a sense of where I’m going with it.</p>
