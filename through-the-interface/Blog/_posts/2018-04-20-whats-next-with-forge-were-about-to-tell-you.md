<p>Many of you have been using <a href="http://forge.autodesk.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Forge</a> services to good effect, whether the Forge viewer or the Data Management, Model Derivative and Design Automation APIs. There’s lots of really cool stuff you can do with Forge – we use it heavily in <a href="http://dasher360.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dasher 360</a>, for instance – but the existing services are largely engineered to deal with data created by existing desktop technology, i.e. they’re file-centric. The next generation of Forge web-services will help you and your customers move beyond files.</p>

<p>Here’s a <a href="http://au.autodesk.com/au-online/classes-on-demand/class-catalog/classes/year-2017/forge/fdc125274#chapter=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">class from last year’s Forge DevCon</a> that gives an introduction to two key technologies in this new landscape called HFDM (for High Frequency Data Management) and the App Framework.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><iframe width="500" height="281" src="//player.ooyala.com/static/v4/stable/4.10.4/skin-plugin/iframe.html?ec=tocmdkZDE6cANZodJXpVqfTGsMneF2ZW&amp;pbid=34ee2c04f0304af88c76585f87c5bd8c&amp;pcode=o3OG46qoFLfL76WkTkb1a9k23qBd" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<p>HFDM is the core technology we’re using to put “Data at the Center”. Rather than passing files around to try to implement disjointed workflows, data can be centralized and accessed by a variety of client applications and services:</p>
<p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b7c962738f970b-pi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img width="500" height="281" title="Data at the Center" style="margin: 30px auto; float: none; display: block;" alt="Data at the Center" src="/assets/image_67709.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>The Forge App Framework is an environment that will greatly simplify the task of creating an app that uses Forge.</p>
<p>Both HFDM and the App Framework will also be the subject of two webinars over the coming weeks, presumably with updated material to give you a sense of where things are, today.</p>
<p>The first is being held next Thursday, and is a high-level overview of these two technologies:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Date : <strong>26th April 2018</strong><br />Time : <strong>8.00 AM PST</strong><br />Duration : 90 minutes<br />Title : <strong>The Future of Making Things on Forge: Sneak Peek at Forge NextGen (HFDM &amp; App Framework)</strong><br />Registration Link: <a href="https://attendee.gotowebinar.com/register/8209398405782333955">https://attendee.gotowebinar.com/register/8209398405782333955</a><br />Presenter:&nbsp; <strong>Lior Gerling</strong>, Sr. Product Manager Forge Platform</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The second is in a more in-depth, technical look at this next generation of Forge services:</p>
