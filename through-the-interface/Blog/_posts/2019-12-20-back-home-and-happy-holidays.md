<p>After getting back to Bangalore from Pune, I did end up having to spend the best part of Wednesday morning dealing with more Indian bureaucracy. The bank I was in was going through its annual archival process, which meant the floor soon filled with papers…</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4ab7155200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Starting the archival process" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Starting the archival process" src="/assets/image_156167.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>… and then boxes containing them.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4d496f6200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="375" height="500" title="We're done" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="We're done" src="/assets/image_603299.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>This brought back memories, as it was Writer Relocations who handled our move to India, back in 2003.</p><p>After this I was able to head across Bangalore to meet with an old friend, Lokessh, for lunch.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4d496fc200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Scooters" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Scooters" src="/assets/image_796753.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4d49708200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="375" height="500" title="Old building" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Old building" src="/assets/image_891554.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Lokessh works just off Queen’s Road, in the old centre of the city.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4f93b47200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Queen's Road" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Queen's Road" src="/assets/image_151319.jpg" border="0"><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4ab7171200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Kean and Lokessh" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Kean and Lokessh" src="/assets/image_652898.jpg" border="0"></a></p></a><p>We went for lunch at a Bangalore institution, Nagarjuna’s.

Even taking a cab at 3:45am, we were stuck for 20 minutes at the toll plaza as we approached Bangalore airport.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4f93b93200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Toll plaza at 4am" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Toll plaza at 4am" src="/assets/image_731778.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>It was once again due to issues implementing the FASTag system in India. I do hope things settle down, soon.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4f93b9d200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Tailbacks already" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Tailbacks already" src="/assets/image_312219.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Arriving at the airport, I managed to clear security and still have a couple of hours to kill. At the gate I had a nasty reminder of how close we were to Christmas.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4d49776200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Deadline" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Deadline" src="/assets/image_144186.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Our 787 Dreamliner was waiting… I’d arrive on the same flight exactly a week before.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4f93baa200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="787 ready for boarding" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="787 ready for boarding" src="/assets/image_738818.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>It wasn’t as busy as I’d expected: I started off having a full row to myself in the bulkhead area (this time in standard economy), but someone did join me, which meant we just had the middle seat empty between us (which was still nice).</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4ab71bb200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Middle bulkhead" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Middle bulkhead" src="/assets/image_171187.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>The flight went smoothly and I changed in Heathrow. The onwards flight was diverted around France – due to the ongoing strikes affecting air traffic control – so it took a bit longer than normal.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4f93bb6200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Detour" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Detour" src="/assets/image_488658.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>The sunset as we approached Geneva was lovely.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4ab71c7200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Sunset in Geneva" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Sunset in Geneva" src="/assets/image_133666.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>I was home at 8pm, and managed to catch up with everyone before passing out for a pretty decent kip.</p><p>On Friday, after dealing with some housekeeping, I headed across to our Gumligen office for our “last day melted cheese lunch”: last year it was raclette, this year it was fondue.<a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4f93c08200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Holiday meal" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Holiday meal" src="/assets/image_428926.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>It was a nice end to a busy year.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4ab7209200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Cheese and jumpers" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Cheese and jumpers" src="/assets/image_942312.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4d497cd200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="375" height="500" title="Lunch" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Lunch" src="/assets/image_261397.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>A few surprise ex-Neuchatel faces were there: Raphael Racine was in from Dublin, and Carla Cudros from Boston.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4d497db200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Old friends" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Old friends" src="/assets/image_39323.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>With that, I’m signing off for the year (and for the decade!). It’s time to spend time with family, to relax, to take stock and to think ahead (in moderation) to the coming year. I wish you all a wonderful, relaxing break, and hope to see you back here in 2020!</p>
