<p>The Localization Services team at Autodesk – many of whom also work from our office in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuch%C3%A2tel" target="_blank">Neuchâtel</a> – has launched a “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowdsourcing" target="_blank">crowdsourced</a>” translation platform: <a href="http://translateit.autodesk.com" target="_blank">the Autodesk Collaborative Translation Platform</a>.</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2015436bc9a64970c-pi" target="_blank"><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 20px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="Translate, Review, Vote" border="0" alt="Translate, Review, Vote" src="/assets/image_307771.jpg" width="474" height="126" /></a></p>  <p>This mechanism is intended to allow members of the Autodesk community to help us translate our software into different languages. The first project being hosted on the platform is for the Russian version of <a href="http://www.homestyler.com/" target="_blank">Homestyler</a>.</p>  <p>To participate in this project, you need to be over 18, proficient in Russian and in possession of an Autodesk ID. For other information on the platform, see <a href="http://translateit.autodesk.com/FAQ.htm" target="_blank">the FAQ</a>.</p>  <p>This is really an exciting development, and one that I hope will – over time – allow our users to have a say in getting Autodesk software translated into many different languages.</p>  <p>I expect to see comments along the lines of: “<em>why not product X in language Y?”.</em> There are a number of reasons: primarily – as with any pilot – we have to start somewhere, of course, but there are also technical and legal hurdles that will need to be overcome before projects for various product/language combinations can be hosted on this platform. Watch this space, though. :-)</p>
