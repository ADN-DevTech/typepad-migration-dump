<p>Another mix of games in <a href="https://youtu.be/2ggi8CJ_QiM" rel="noopener" target="_blank">this week’s episode</a>! It’s hard to know what the first game, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_Runner_(video_game)" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Road Runner</a>, was meant to be, as it really must have been corrupted – there’s no other reason for the graphics to be so messed up. The second, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hobbit_(1982_video_game)" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Hobbit</a>, was an illustrated text adventure I remember playing for hours on my ZX Spectrum as a boy. The third was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B.C.%27s_Quest_for_Tires" rel="noopener" target="_blank">B.C.’s Quest for Tires</a>, which seems like it was probably a classic when it came out in 1983. We finished up with an obscure but playable title named <a href="https://www.gamesdatabase.org/game/commodore-64/fortress-underground" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Fortress Underground</a>, which I actually rather enjoyed.</p>
