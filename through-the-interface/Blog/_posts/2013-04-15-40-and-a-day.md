<p>So that’s it, then. As mentioned <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2012/12/midlife-crisis-planning.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">some months ago</a>, I’ve now successfully transitioned from thirtysomething to fortysomething.</p>
<p>To celebrate the day itself, I shared a cheese fondue with family and a few friends. What was a bit different about this meal is that we had it in the back of <a href="http://attelage-gals.e-monsite.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a specially adapted horse-drawn carriage</a> that took us along the banks of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thielle" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the river Thielle</a>. A very nice experience to share.</p>
<p>It was beautiful weather, the Alps were visible in the distance and there was still snow on top of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chasseral" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the Chasseral</a> (off to the left, in the below photo). Absolutely fantastic.</p>

<p>And yes, there was a little wine consumed along with the cheese. This isn’t the best of photos, but at least I’m not incriminating anyone else present. ;-)</p>

<p>This week I’m planning to take a closer look at the JavaScript API in AutoCAD 2014, although we’ll see if I get the chance to post anything on it before next week (which I’ll be spending in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Bay_Area" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the San Francisco Bay Area</a>). I have a few other topics that may end up sneaking in beforehand – we’ll see.</p>
