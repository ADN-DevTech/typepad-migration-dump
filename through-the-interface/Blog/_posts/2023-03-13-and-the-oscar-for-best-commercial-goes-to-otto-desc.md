<p>Yesterday’s Oscar ceremony was punctuated by a series of commercials (or adverts, as we call them back home) by Autodesk.</p><p>The first few paid homage to a mythical filmmaker/visual effects specialist named Otto Desćinski – or Otto Desć to his friends.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202b6852d3739200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="375" height="375" title="Otto Desc" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Otto Desc" src="/assets/image_369076.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>It was only during the third segment that the secret was unveiled, that the series was really all about Autodesk.</p><p>Here’s the extended cut, showing content from all three segments:</p><p align="center"><br></p><p align="center"><iframe width="500" height="283" title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MqMg9iAjwdw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"></iframe></p><p align="center"><br></p><p>The whole thing was really nicely executed: <a href="https://twitter.com/VancityReynolds" target="_blank">Ryan Reynolds</a>’ creative agency, <a href="https://twitter.com/maximumeffort" target="_blank">Maximum Effort</a>, were behind it, and our new Chief Marketing Officer, <a href="https://adsknews.autodesk.com/en/news/autodesk-appoints-chief-marketing-officer" target="_blank">Dara Treseder</a>, clearly played a role. I’m sure there were many others, too.</p><p>It’s always nice when I can show something like this to my kids and they say “that’s so cool!” Thanks to all those who made this happen: being cool to your teenage kids is definitely something worth celebrating.</p>
