<p>I seem to spend quite a bit of time, these days, talking about the new Autodesk office in Toronto. I did visit one part of the office when <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2017/07/toronto.html" target="_blank">I came through in July 2017</a> – on <a href="http://keanw.com/round-the-world" target="_blank">our world tour</a> – but people hadn’t, at that point, fully moved across from the former 210 King St East office. So this week was – somewhat surprisingly – the first time I’d actually seen the generatively-designed office space first-hand. Crazy.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a46c70ba200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Generatively-designed Autodesk sign" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Generatively-designed Autodesk sign" src="/assets/image_167326.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>I’ve been staying in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_Hotel,_Toronto" target="_blank">Chelsea Hotel</a> – apparently the largest hotel in Canada, with about a thousand rooms – which is conveniently located for the office, but isn’t the height of luxury. (Although I will say that the pool and fitness area on the 27th floor make up for the relative crumminess of the guest rooms.)</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4435020200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="View from my balcony" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="View from my balcony" src="/assets/image_766638.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>On Wednesday I spent my first day in the MaRS office, meeting with various people regarding either <a href="http://dasher360.com" target="_blank">Dasher 360</a> or the generative design tools we’re working on.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a46c70c6200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="The Research area" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="The Research area" src="/assets/image_407034.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>I’m super-excited about the direction things are headed, especially on the generative side of things. Rhys Goldstein outlined an approach he’s considering for implementing isovists using a grid-based lattice (the same one we’re using for path-finding) that should be much more nuanced than the current ray-casting approach used in most situations: you’ll get a fuzzy value back rather than something that’s basically boolean.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4435024200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Whiteboarding isovist implementation" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Whiteboarding isovist implementation" src="/assets/image_518919.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Simon Breslav has been working hard on exposing the capabilities of the space analysis library to Dynamo, and building some examples showing how it all works.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4435028200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Working on Project Discover metrics" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Working on Project Discover metrics" src="/assets/image_900798.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Simon, Rhys and Hali took me through the bowels of the building to get some food at lunchtime. It didn’t seem the most direct way to get there, but then the current path-finding implementation doesn’t worry about pesky things like stairs (and they did claim to be taking the scenic route). ;-)</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4910ced200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="375" height="500" title="Real-life path-finding" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Real-life path-finding" src="/assets/image_652756.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>The office itself is really impressive. Here it is from across the street:</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4435035200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="375" height="500" title="MaRS at dusk" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="MaRS at dusk" src="/assets/image_239446.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Here’s the front entrance to MaRS itself:</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a443503b200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="375" height="500" title="The front entrance to MaRS" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="The front entrance to MaRS" src="/assets/image_141679.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a46c70e5200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="The entrance from the other side" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="The entrance from the other side" src="/assets/image_842042.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>MaRS was built around the old Toronto General Hospital.

It was held in the Faculty Club of the nearby University of Toronto. Ths club was about 2km from my hotel, but I opted to walk there. The windchill at the moment has taken the perceived temperature down to around -15 or -20 celius, so it was brisk, to say the least.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a46c7122200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="A brisk walk across the UofT campus" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="A brisk walk across the UofT campus" src="/assets/image_532171.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>The offsite’s location was a nice old building:</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a46c712a200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="375" height="500" title="UofT Faculty Club" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="UofT Faculty Club" src="/assets/image_917778.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>The Science team spent a fun day discussing the goals for the new team.
