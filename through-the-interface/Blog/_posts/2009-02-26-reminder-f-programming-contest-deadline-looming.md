<p>There are just a few days left before the <strong>February 28th</strong> deadline of the <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2009/01/f-programming-contest.html">F# programming contest</a>. Thanks to those of you who have already submitted entries!</p> <p>At least one potential prize is still up for grabs - beyond those I've ear-marked for existing entrants - so if you're working on something and plan on submitting it in the next week or two (even if you won't be able to meet the original deadline for the actual submission), then <a href="mailto:kean.walmsley@autodesk.com">please let me know by email</a>. If you haven't notified me by Saturday that you have something in the works then I'm afraid there's a good chance you won't be in the running for a prize.</p>
