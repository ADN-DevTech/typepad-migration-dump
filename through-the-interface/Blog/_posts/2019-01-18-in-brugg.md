<p>Today I’m back in the Swiss town of Brugg, to give a talk about Generative Design to a group of Masters students at the <a href="https://www.fhnw.ch/en" target="_blank">FHNW</a>.</p><p>(In case you don’t recognise the reference, the title of today’s post is a probably-overly-subtle nod to the Oscar-nominated, 2008 film <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0780536/" target="_blank">“In Bruges”</a>: Brugge is the Flemish name for Bruges, and I wouldn’t be surprised to find out that Brugg has a similar derivation in Swiss German.)</p><p>I first visited Brugg as <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2018/08/neuchatel-to-appenzell.html" target="_blank">we cycled along the Aare river last summer</a>, and was invited back after <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2018/11/generative-design-and-iot-a-virtuous-circle.html" target="_blank">presenting about Generative Design and Digital Twins at the other FHNW campus in Muttenz</a>. Anyway, I’m very happy to be giving my first University lecture on Generative Design here, which I’m hoping will be a lot of fun.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad3d19d74200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="The Aare in Brugg, just before it heads north to Germany" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="The Aare in Brugg, just before it heads north to Germany" src="/assets/image_943590.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Most of the lecture will be quite similiar in nature to the <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/autodesk-university/class/Getting-Started-Generative-Design-AEC-2018" target="_blank">“Getting Started with Generative Design for AEC”</a> talk <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2018/11/au-2018-class-recordings-are-now-online.html" target="_blank">I gave at AU 2018</a>, so you can always start there.</p><p>To help the students avoid having to scribble down too many notes, here are the important links from today’s slide-deck:</p><ul><li>If interested in working with Revit, download it for free</li><ul><li><a href="http://autodesk.com/students">autodesk.com/students</a></li></ul><li>Download Dynamo 2.0.2</li><ul><li><a href="http://dynamobim.org/download">dynamobim.org/download</a></li></ul><li>Download Refinery from the Beta site</li><ul><li><a href="http://autode.sk/RefineryBeta">autode.sk/RefineryBeta</a></li></ul><li>Today’s sample is available at</li><ul><li><a href="http://autode.sk/tiling">autode.sk/tiling</a></li></ul></ul><p>A quick update, now that the event is over…</p><p>Wissam Wahbeh, who had invited me to present to his students, shared this picture of me in action:</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad3b22410200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Presenting at FHNW in Brugg" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Presenting at FHNW in Brugg" src="/assets/image_322882.jpg" border="0"></a>It was a relatively small group – just a dozen or so – but it was, indeed, fun. Thanks for the invitation, Wissam!</p>
