<p>The material for this year’s online Autodesk DevDays is <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLuFh5NgXkweMvUIfCD_UlWE-v1nmMvoWN" target="_blank">now live on YouTube</a>. These sessions were held back in March, but now that the various products discussed have been released publicly, the information has been made available for everyone (i.e. not only covered by the Non-Disclosure Agreement signed by Autodesk Developer Network members, the famously palindromic ADN NDA).</p><p>Here’s the full playlist, if you want to watch it here:</p><p><br></p><p align="center"><iframe width="500" height="283" title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PLuFh5NgXkweMvUIfCD_UlWE-v1nmMvoWN" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"></iframe></p><p><br></p><p>Here are links to the individual sessions:</p><ul><li><a href="https://youtu.be/TlVJu3ik2Yo" target="_blank">Autodesk DevDays 2021 keynotes</a></li><li><a href="https://youtu.be/pvpl_LxqgPA" target="_blank">Inventor, Vault and Fusion API update</a></li><li><a href="https://youtu.be/CJe4sIW8RQI" target="_blank">AutoCAD API update</a></li><li><a href="https://youtu.be/wV91naM9-4M" target="_blank">Revit API update</a></li><li><a href="https://youtu.be/CD7nuqpsAY4" target="_blank">Civil 3D update</a></li></ul><p>One interesting tidbit from the keynote session is a mention of exposing APIs for AutoCAD Web. <a href="https://youtu.be/TlVJu3ik2Yo?t=2700" target="_blank">Here’s the relevant segment</a>, if you want to watch it for yourself. Jim provides a link to <a href="https://autode.sk/3qT9tKY" target="_blank">survey being run by the AutoCAD User Research team</a>. I’m not sure if they’re still scanning responses, but the survey is live at the time of writing: if you’re interested in seeing LISP, .NET, etc. running inside AutoCAD Web then I suggest filling it out.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20278802dd6e8200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="281" title="Jim Quanci discussing the possibility of AutoCAD Web APIs" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Jim Quanci discussing the possibility of AutoCAD Web APIs" src="/assets/image_647187.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>DevDays are a great source of developer-centric information on Autodesk’s various platforms but they’re a bit like Santa: they only come once a year.</p><p>If you’re looking for information from the Developer Advocacy and Support team – with the main focus being on Forge – then I strongly recommend attending the fortnightly <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCudNce5mot_m6mYgmbqPtLg/videos" target="_blank">Forge Coffee Break</a>. These are usually hosted by <a href="https://twitter.com/augustomaia" target="_blank">Augusto Goncalves</a>, but as he’s currently out on leave, <a href="https://twitter.com/AfroJme" target="_blank">Jaime Rosales</a> has taken over for the last few sessions.</p><p>I can’t always join – it really depends on whether someone has scheduled a meeting on top of the Wednesday 5pm CET timeslot – but I did manage to join yesterday’s and ended up chatting quite a bit with <a href="https://twitter.com/micbeale" target="_blank">Michael Beale</a> about the work the <a href="https://dasher360.com" target="_blank">Dasher</a> team has been doing with the <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2021/05/its-officially-available-data-visualization-extension-for-the-forge-viewer.html" target="_blank">Forge viewer’s Data Visualization Extension (Project Hyperion)</a>. Here’s <a href="https://youtu.be/LFgiAnrs1fg" target="_blank">Episode XXIII</a>, in case you’re interested in this particular topic:</p><p align="center"><br></p><p align="center"><iframe width="500" height="283" title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LFgiAnrs1fg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"></iframe></p><p><br></p><p>Of course attendees are free to ask any questions about Forge that interest them. Feel free to drop me a note if you want to use a particular session to discuss something you think I may have thoughts on – I’ll do my best to attend! The next session is on June 16th (although I see I already have meeting conflicts for the next couple of Coffee Breaks, so it may not be until mid-July, unfortunately).</p>
