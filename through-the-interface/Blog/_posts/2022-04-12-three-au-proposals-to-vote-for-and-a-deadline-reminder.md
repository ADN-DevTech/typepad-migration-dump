The <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/autodesk-university/conference/call-for-proposals" target="_blank">Call for Proposals</a> closes on <strong>April 15th</strong>.<br>I’ve now submitted three classes, myself, and would greatly appreciate you voting for the one(s) you would like to see part of the event. This is whether you intend on being there in-person in New Orleans or not: the vast majority of classes will either be livestreamed or recorded and made available on-demand for virtual attendees.</p><p>Here they are. Voting is open until <strong>April 25th</strong>.</p><ul><li><a title="https://www.autodesk.com/autodesk-university/conference/proposal/Voxel-based-Architectural-Space-Analysis-inside-Dynamo" href="https://www.autodesk.com/autodesk-university/conference/proposal/Voxel-based-Architectural-Space-Analysis-inside-Dynamo" target="_blank"><font size="4">Voxel-based Architectural Space Analysis inside Dynamo</font></a></li><li><a title="https://www.autodesk.com/autodesk-university/conference/proposal/Building-Digital-Twins-AEC-using-Forge" href="https://www.autodesk.com/autodesk-university/conference/proposal/Building-Digital-Twins-AEC-using-Forge" target="_blank"><font size="4">Building Digital Twins for AEC using Forge</font></a></li><li><a title="https://www.autodesk.com/autodesk-university/conference/proposal/tale-two-smart-bridges-3D-printing-intelligent-infrastructure" href="https://www.autodesk.com/autodesk-university/conference/proposal/tale-two-smart-bridges-3D-printing-intelligent-infrastructure" target="_blank"><font size="4">A tale of two smart bridges: 3D-printing intelligent infrastructure</font></a></li></ul><p>Many thanks for taking the time to vote!</p>
