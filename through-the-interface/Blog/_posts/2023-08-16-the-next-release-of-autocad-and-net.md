After a break of several years, I’m once again posting about the topic this blog was founded (17 years ago!) to help people get to grips with: AutoCAD and .NET.</p><p>This is definitely a blip rather than a trend, however: I just wanted to amplify <a href="https://adndevblog.typepad.com/autocad/2023/08/call-for-action-next-release-of-autocad.html" target="_blank">this post</a> by my friend Madhu Moogala, which talks at a very high level about the next release of AutoCAD (2024+1) and its API technology.</p><p>Cutting to the chase, the nugget of information that interested me most is that AutoCAD will now support <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.NET" target="_blank">.NET</a> (formerly known as .NET Core) rather than the Windows-specific <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.NET_Framework" target="_blank">.NET Framework</a>. The Alpha versions will use .NET 6 while the engineering team is expecting to support .NET 8 with the shipping release.</p><p>In and of itself this doesn’t mean much, in truth: it doesn’t automagically mean that AutoCAD will support .NET on non-Windows platforms, sadly. But it does unlock the house containing the door that could be forced open to that being a possibility, which I admit to finding very exciting.</p>
