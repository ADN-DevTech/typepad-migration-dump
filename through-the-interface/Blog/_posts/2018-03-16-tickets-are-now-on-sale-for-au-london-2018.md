Until <strong>April 30th</strong> you can get the earlybird discount of £160 on the regular price: for the next several weeks the price is <strong>£540 + VAT</strong> instead of £700 + VAT.</p><p>I’ll be attending – and speaking at – this year’s AU London. I’ll be presenting a session entitled “<em>Using Forge to Connect BIM to the Internet of Things</em>” on June 19th at 3:25pm. Here’s the class description from the <a href="http://gems.autodesk.com/events/au-london-2018/agenda-d4123ca7489e4769a1da0ed028a7dc27.aspx" target="_blank">AU London website</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Autodesk Research has been working on the display of building performance data in a rich 3D environment since 2009. During the last 2 years this development effort has shifted to make heavy use of the Forge platform to integrate the display of sensor data with high-quality, as-built BIM. The project has also evolved beyond the initial focus on building performance to explore use-cases in construction and factory management. This session looks at some of the lessons Autodesk Research has learned during the development of Dasher 360, with a particular focus on the benefits found from using the Forge platform to reinvent a heavyweight desktop client for the cloud. We will talk about how tools such as Dasher 360 can integrate data from a variety of sources, creating compelling, web-based tools that dramatically expand the use of design data. While the session will focus largely on the development of Dasher 360, and therefore be of interest to programmers and software development managers' it will highlight how Forge has been used alongside advanced data visualisation techniques to create a tool for facilities managers and building owners/operators. People from various backgrounds will therefore find the session to be of interest.</p></blockquote><p>It’s going to be a fun couple of weeks… there’s a <a href="http://autodeskcloudaccelerator.com/" target="_blank">Forge Accelerator</a> from June 11-15 in Barcelona, then the Autodesk Football Tournament in Bordeaux on June 16-17 and then AU London the week after. This means I probably won’t spend the full week in Barcelona: I’ll probably come for the latter half of the week, as otherwise it’s going to be nearly 2 weeks away from home (and at the end of the school year there’s always way too much going on for this to be a comfortable thing).</p><p>Anyway – I’m ver much looking forward to AU London, especially as I skipped the last Autodesk University in Las Vegas. Be sure to reach out if you’d like to meet up and chat while I’m across at the event!</p>
