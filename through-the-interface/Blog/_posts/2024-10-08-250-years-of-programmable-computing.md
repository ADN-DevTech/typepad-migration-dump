<p>This is a topic I can’t quite believe I haven’t covered at any point during this blog’s existence, as I&#39;m such a huge fan of a) the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuch%C3%A2tel" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Neuchâtel</a> region and b) vintage computing.</p>
<p>This year marks the 250th anniversary of the creation of the world’s first programmable computer, which also happened to be the world’s first programmable robot. This might be a bit confusing to some, especially those who associate this concept with Babbage, Turing, etc. The world’s first “computer” was a mechanical automaton that translated a “program” into (mechanical) hand-written output. So no, it’s not a general-purpose computing device, but it’s still way more than a glorified printing press.</p>
<p>The device is an automaton <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaquet-Droz_automata" rel="noopener" target="_blank">built in the early 1770s in la Chaux-de-Fonds by the Jaquet-Droz family</a>. It’s called The Writer, and sits alongside The Musician and The Draughtsman in the <a href="https://www.mahn.ch/en/expositions/automates-jaquet-droz" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Neuchâtel Museum of Art and History</a>. (There’s apparently a missing fourth automaton, called The Cave, which may well be sitting in someone’s private collection or otherwise gathering dust in an attic… how exciting it would be to discover that!)</p>
<p>These automata apparently inspired the one shown in the movie <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0970179/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Hugo</a> (something I’ve mentioned a <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2016/10/design-night-switzerland-on-october-20th.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">couple</a> of <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2013/04/a-fab-lab-opens-its-doors-in-neuchtel.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">times</a> in the past).</p>
<p>Every first Sunday of the month the Jaquet-Droz automata are demonstrated to the public. I went along with my family on Sunday, as it had been a long time since the last time.</p>

<p>Unfortunately The Writer needs to have a piece replaced to be back in working order, but we did see the other two in action, and it’s still impressive to see its internal complexity.</p>

<p>There are a few videos on this topic worth watching, to help understand the genius behind these incredible pieces.</p>
<p>The first is the one shown when you visit the museum, and captures views of the internals of each of the automata from a (recent?) cleaning they received. The Writer’s segment is at the end, starting at the 12m30s mark.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">&#0160;</p>
<p>The next is a BBC show called <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p019ng2n" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Mechanical Marvels - Clockwork Dreams</a>. I could only find <a href="https://youtu.be/YMDFRwxCSwA" rel="noopener" target="_blank">this posting of the full episode</a>, with the relevant segment starting at 28m30s.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&#0160;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">&#0160;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">There is another posting of <a href="https://youtu.be/OehTO9l1Hp8" rel="noopener" target="_blank">just the segment on The Writer</a>, in case the above one disappears by the time you’re reading this.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The last video I suggest watching is this one showing the history of <a href="https://www.jaquet-droz.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the Jaquet Droz company</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&#0160;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="283" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WofWNcMHcl0?si=PC90CkV4EbBOSyOq" title="YouTube video player" width="500"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&#0160;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In fact the automata - despite being truly impressive in their own right - were primarily used as a business development tool: they allowed access to new markets (crossing international borders “easily”, albeit on horseback and over a period of months) and attracted a clientele who might then buy Jaquet-Droz watches.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It’s astounding to think that these wonderful objects are still in working order after 250 years. The Neuchâtel region is still known for its precision engineering - with watch-making and micro-electronics remaining important specialties of local companies and academic institutions - which is in an important sense the other real legacy of these early innovators.</p>
