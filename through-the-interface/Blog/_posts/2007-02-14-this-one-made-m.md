<p>MSDN is a great source of information - whether when researching issues or looking for explanatory links for this blog. And I'm hoping, over time, to see more community content (as MSDN is now essentially all in wiki format), although until now I haven't come across any, I have to say. This is also something we're looking into, by the way: wikis just seem a perfect vehicle for developer documentation. But that one's still very much &quot;in research&quot;...</p>

<p>Anyway - I was researching some information for my next post (which should be finished very shortly), and followed a link from Google to MSDN. Unfortunately - and quite shockingly to me, given the high expectations I have for Microsoft websites - the site was overrun:</p>

<p><a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=369,height=223,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/msdn_server_busy.png"><img title="Msdn_server_busy" height="181" alt="Msdn_server_busy" src="/assets/msdn_server_busy.png" width="300" border="0" /></a>&nbsp; </p>

<p>In my stunned state, I decided to check the main MSDN website (same result) and microsoft.com (which worked fine). And that's where I saw this advertisement...</p>

<p><a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=480,height=325,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/exchange.png"><img title="Exchange" height="203" alt="Exchange" src="/assets/exchange.png" width="300" border="0" /></a> </p>

<p>Oh, the irony. :-)</p>

<p><em>Note:</em> as of the time of publication, the MSDN site is now once again responding to my requests. Phew!</p>
