<p>I have to admit it’s a little bittersweet to be talking about this year’s Forge DevCon: I’ve been involved in helping schedule some great classes for the AR/VR track, but I won’t be presenting myself – or even present at the event, at all – this year. But it’s all in a good cause: <a href="http://walmsley.ch" target="_blank">our big trip is progressing well</a>, and – in any case – I’ve had <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2017/08/from-monterey-to-marin-county.html" target="_blank">enough time in Las Vegas for the year</a>. :-)</p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b7c91452fd970b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="198" title="Forge DevCon Registration" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Forge DevCon Registration" src="/assets/image_600457.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>For those of you attending, you can now <a href="http://au.autodesk.com/las-vegas/registration-pricing/forge-devcon" target="_blank">go ahead and register</a>. If you want to attend <strong>just the DevCon</strong>, you will be paying <strong>$295</strong>. If you want to attend <strong>AU 2017, too</strong>, then I recommend getting the “early bird” option at <strong>$1,845</strong>. The price will go up to $2,270 on October 16th. (In either case this equates to $95 to attend the DevCon on top of the cost to attend AU, so it’s great value to get the combined pass.)</p><p>Having been involved in the class selection process, I can say that there’s a whole load of awesome content being prepared for this year’s event. And having been in the San Francisco office for the last 3 days, I can also tell you that a number of our product teams are working on some really cool stuff that they’re planning to unveil there, too. It certainly won’t disappoint!</p><p><a href="https://autodeskuniversity.smarteventscloud.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=121804" target="_blank">One class I’d like to call out specifically</a> is being delivered by my colleague Simon Breslav: he’ll be talking about how we’ve used the Forge platform to implement <a href="http://dasher360.com" target="_blank">Dasher 360</a>. This class will be of great interest not only to people looking to integrate IoT data with BIM, but also to anyone considering building serious applications using Forge.</p><p>We’re now done with our North American leg of the trip: we’ll be heading off to Peru first thing tomorrow. I’ll try to post a quick update on how the last week has gone before the week is over, though.</p>
