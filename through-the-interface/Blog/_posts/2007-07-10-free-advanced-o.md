<p>Over the last few years my team has been delivering more and more webcasts about the APIs to our various products. I'd strongly recommend checking the schedule on <a href="http://www.autodesk.com/apitraining">http://www.autodesk.com/apitraining</a> from time to time, to see what's there. These webcasts are free to everyone, not just ADN members (although the ADN site does reference the various recorded presentations).</p>

<p>Right now we're in the process of delivering a series of webcasts covering advanced AutoCAD programming topics, with information relevant to those programming with either ObjectARX or .NET. The first was delivered a few weeks ago, and covered &quot;<em>Storing Custom Data in a Drawing</em>&quot;. If you're interested in the topic, here's <a href="http://download.autodesk.com/media/adn/AutoCAD-Storing_Custom_Data_in_a_Drawing/AutoCAD_Storing_Custom_Data_in_a_Drawing.zip">a recording of the session</a> for you to view.</p>

<p>The next session, a &quot;<em>Custom Objects Masterclass</em>&quot;, is scheduled for Thursday July 12. If you're reading this post in time and would like to attend, <a href="http://www.adskconsulting.com/adn/cs/api_course_sched.php">go here to register</a>. Otherwise I'll let you know where to get the recording, once it's posted.</p>

<p>The penultimate session in the series covers &quot;<em>Creating an Installer</em>&quot; - this is already in the schedule, so feel free to sign up for this one well in advance. :-)</p>
