<p>For those of you that haven't noticed the current obsession in the CAD blogosphere of creating Simpsons avatars of oneself, check out <a href="http://labs.autodesk.com/blogs/its_alive_in_the_lab/view/simpsons-avatar/">this post from the Autodesk Labs blog</a> for some background.</p>

<p>Now, to enter the fray myself. I spent some time a week or so ago playing around with the avatar creation tool on <a href="http://www.simpsonsmovie.com/">The Simpsons Movie</a> website, but was pretty disappointed with the results:</p>

<p><a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=115,height=320,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/07/27/boring_avatar.png"></a><img title="Boring_avatar_2" alt="Boring_avatar_2" src="/assets/boring_avatar_2.png" border="0" style="MARGIN: 0px 5px 5px 0px" /></p>

<p>But then I discovered the <a href="http://www.simpsonizeme.com/">Simpsonize Me</a> website, and my life changed. :-)</p>

<p>This site allows you to upload a photo, and it generates an avatar for you pretty much automatically (you have to specify a few parameters and can tweak the output, but this was a huge improvement, at least for someone with my extremely modest artistic talent):</p>

<p> <img title="Simpsonized_kean_full_body_4" alt="Simpsonized_kean_full_body_4" src="/assets/simpsonized_kean_full_body_4.png" border="0" /> </p>

<p>The resolution of the output isn't as good as with the other tool, but you can get a fairly decent headshot for IM:</p>

<p><img title="Simpsonized_kean_headshot_for_im" alt="Simpsonized_kean_headshot_for_im" src="/assets/simpsonized_kean_headshot_for_im.png" border="0" style="MARGIN: 0px 0px 5px 5px" /> </p>
