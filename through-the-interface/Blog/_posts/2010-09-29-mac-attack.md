<p>Well, I’ve finally taken the plunge and ordered a MacBook Pro. I have very little experience with Apple products – other than owning an aging <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPod_Photo" target="_blank">iPod Photo</a> and having bought an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPod_Touch" target="_blank">iPod Touch</a> for my wife – so this is quite a departure for me. I’m far from being ready to call myself <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Get_a_Mac" target="_blank">“a Mac” rather than “a PC”</a>, but if I’m to talk intelligently about working with <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2010/09/autocad-for-mac.html" target="_blank">AutoCAD for Mac</a> then it was bound to happen, sooner or later.</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2013487d3e87f970c-pi"><img style="border-right-width: 0px; margin: 10px 10px 10px 20px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" title="MacBook Pro" border="0" alt="MacBook Pro" align="right" src="/assets/image_834483.jpg" width="269" height="145" /></a> I ordered <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbookpro/specs.html" target="_blank">the 15” model with a screen and processor upgrade</a>. I’m very curious to see how it performs.</p>  <p>A number of my team members use MacBook Pro machines as their primary systems, albeit hosting a Windows OS for the vast majority of their day-to-day work: some use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boot_Camp_(software)" target="_blank">BootCamp</a> but others are using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallels_Desktop_for_Mac" target="_blank">Parallels Desktop</a> exclusively with great success. I’m probably going down the latter path, as I’m keen not to partition my harddrive and take a wild guess at where the space will be used up more quickly.</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2013487d3e88f970c-pi"><img style="border-right-width: 0px; margin: 10px 20px 10px 10px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" title="arxformac" border="0" alt="arxformac" align="left" src="/assets/image_846853.jpg" width="87" height="87" /></a> While on the topic of Mac machines, our old friend Fernando Mallard has launched <a href="http://arxformac.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">a new blog focused on ObjectARX development for Mac</a>. I’m certainly looking forward to learning more about this topic, myself, in due course.</p>  <p>Another old friend (and ex-colleague), Eugene Evon, is now working at Apple, heading up their Certification Training product development and programs. He emailed me a few weeks ago to let me know of the first “certification” to come out under his watch, focused on helping integrate Macs into Windows networks (which I imagine lots of people are doing, these days).</p>  <p>Here’s <a href="http://training.apple.com/itpro/macinteg" target="_blank">the free online learning content</a>. It looks as though some of the pre-requisites for this class (such as <a href="http://www.apple.com/support/switch101/" target="_blank">Switch 101</a>) would be of use to me, so I’ll probably run through that, at some point.</p>  <p>I have to admit to being a bit apprehensive about “the switch” (although I’m hoping my Mac will simply be a great PC for much of what I do :-). I can see how integrated hardware and software can bring certain advantages from a quality perspective, but the loss of choice and of control is something that concerns me. I dare say I’ll get over it, in time, but for now I’m just doing my best to reserve judgment.</p>  <p>If any of you have experience or opinions you’d like to share on this topic, feel free to post a comment.</p>
