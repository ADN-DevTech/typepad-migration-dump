<p>If I’d been anywhere else over the last few weeks, it would certainly have been the fine city of Toronto.</p><p>The first <a href="https://keanw.com/2019/07/the-generative-design-for-aec-intensive-residency-kicks-off-in-toronto.html" target="_blank">GD for AEC</a> <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2019/07/week-1-of-the-generative-design-for-aec-intensive-residency-in-toronto.html" target="_blank">Intensive Residency</a> hosted there wrapped up, with a number of interesting outcomes generated. One has been <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6560995267875868672/" target="_blank">shared by Isaac Seah on LinkedIn</a>, and it’s well worth looking into the details of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/exploring-generative-design-coastal-resilience-isaac-seah" target="_blank">how they used Generative Design via Refinery and Dynamo to explore increasing resilience of coastal cities in the face of climate change</a>. It’s very interesting stuff.</p><p>Then there was another GD and Dynamo Hackathon held there, once again with the support of <a href="https://twitter.com/radugidei" target="_blank">Radu Gidei</a> from <a href="https://twitter.com/enstoa" target="_blank">Enstoa</a> and the <a href="https://twitter.com/ukdynug" target="_blank">UKDynUG</a>. According to Simon Breslav, who participated heavily in both events, the high-energy 2-day Hackathon was a very interesting change of pace from the more quality-centric 2-week Residency.</p><p>The Hackathon also resulted in some cool outcomes… Here are the winning teams, with several images borrowed shamelessly from <a href="https://twitter.com/kcmarchitect" target="_blank">Kyle Martin</a>, who did an awesome job of documenting the event via Twitter.</p><p>In third place was the Binception team (to which Kyle belonged).</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a49b6f91200d-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="Binception" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_644966.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="Binception" width="375" /></a></p><p>As well as having some inspired team naming, they made clever use of the <a href="https://github.com/DynamoDS/RefineryToolkits" target="_blank">Refinery Toolkit</a> (something I’ll talk about in a future post) to implement a “double-nested bin packing approach to optimizing modular residential layouts.”</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4c01305200b-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="Binception" height="281" src="/assets/image_162334.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; float: none; display: block;" title="Binception" width="500" /></a></p><p>In second place was the Trainwreck team from Arcadis. This was <a href="https://twitter.com/LaurenceElsdon" target="_blank">Laurence Elsdon</a>’s second Hackathon prize in as many events, having been part of the winning Binoculars team at the <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2019/04/the-first-dynamo-hackathon.html" target="_blank">London Hackathon</a>.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a49b6fef200d-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="Trainwreck" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_794953.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="Trainwreck" width="500" /></a></p><p>The Arcadis team created <a href="https://twitter.com/LaurenceElsdon/status/1156958087858851847" target="_blank">a visual difference tool</a> for Dynamo graphs. <a href="https://github.com/ArcadisHackathon/TrainWreck" target="_blank">You can access the Git repo here</a>. This is going to be really handy!</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4723c58200c-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="Dynamo Diff" height="270" src="/assets/image_648031.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; float: none; display: block;" title="Dynamo Diff" width="500" /></a></p><p>In first place was the Seurat team, which comprised of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/merececarri" target="_blank">Mercedes Carriquiry</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/justyna-szychowska-741bb812b/" target="_blank">Justyna Szychowska</a> and our very own <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sbreslav/" target="_blank">Simon Breslav</a>.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4723c5e200c-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="Seurat" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_65799.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="Seurat" width="500" /></a></p><p>The Seurat team created an extension that reads the results of your Refinery studies and generates a graphical analytics view into the generated data. <a href="https://github.com/sbreslav/SeuratExtension" target="_blank">Here’s the Git repo</a>, but the extension is also available via the Dynamo Package Manager.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4723c62200c-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="Seurat" height="385" src="/assets/image_971252.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; float: none; display: block;" title="Seurat" width="500" /></a></p><p>Simon tells me I contributed to the extension, as they borrowed code – the piece that reads in and displays the various Refinery studies – from <a href="https://github.com/KeanW/Capturefinery" target="_blank">Capturefinery</a>. So I do feel a little pride in the team’s win, even if the success is very much their own.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4723c69200c-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="The Seurat team" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_98690.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="The Seurat team" width="500" /></a></p><p>Congratulations to the winners, the other participants and the organisers of this event!</p><p>I would have loved to have been there in person, but I really needed some time off with my family. Here are a few snaps I took over the last few weeks.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4c0138a200b-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="Walking in the woods" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_820990.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="Walking in the woods" width="500" /></a><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4c01392200b-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="Waterfalls" border="0" height="500" src="/assets/image_591602.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="Waterfalls" width="375" /></a></p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4c01396200b-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="Les gorges de l&#39;Areuse" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_187313.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="Les gorges de l&#39;Areuse" width="500" /></a><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4723cdd200c-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="Crossing scary bridges" border="0" height="500" src="/assets/image_631159.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="Crossing scary bridges" width="375" /></a><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4c0139e200b-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="An early harvest" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_285109.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="An early harvest" width="500" /></a></p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4723ce1200c-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="Windsurfing" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_411669.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="Windsurfing" width="500" /></a></p><p>As it has happened, I’ve ended up using some time over the last few weeks to make some quite significant changes to the <a href="http://dasher360.com" target="_blank">Dasher 360</a> codebase – something I haven’t had the time to do for the longest time and feels really good. I’ll be talking a lot more about this during the coming months, but I’ll wrap up my time off with my family, first.</p>
