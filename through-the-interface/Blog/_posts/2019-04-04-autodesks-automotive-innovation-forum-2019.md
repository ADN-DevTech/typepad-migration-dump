<p>This is “one of those weeks”, with presentations in Munich on Wednesday, Barcelona on Thursday and London on Friday. I haven’t had a week like this since the old DevDays tours. The good old days!</p><p>I arrived on Tuesday night at Munich Airport.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a44e86e0200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Someone walking through Munich Airport" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Someone walking through Munich Airport" src="/assets/image_769283.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Wednesday’s event was the Automotive Innovation Forum in Munich. It’s the first time I’ve attended this event, and it proved to be very interesting: around 560 automotive customers came to the Hilton at Munich Airport to learn about our automotive-related offerings (primarily Alias and VRED but also our generative design tools).</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a44e86e8200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="The Hilton at Munich Airport" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="The Hilton at Munich Airport" src="/assets/image_948773.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a44e86ec200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="AIF 2019 welcome" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="AIF 2019 welcome" src="/assets/image_895481.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>The day opened with various keynotes. I particularly enjoyed those by Rivian and BMW design.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a49c5aa8200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Rivian's keynote" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Rivian's keynote" src="/assets/image_719347.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a44e86f1200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="BMW's design keynote" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="BMW's design keynote" src="/assets/image_893129.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>I was part of the “Experience” track, which was kicked off by Daniel Darancou from Qiantu, an emerging Chinese EV company:</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a49c5abb200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Daniel Darancou from Qiantu" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Daniel Darancou from Qiantu" src="/assets/image_343053.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>I was asked to talk about “Digital Twins for Factories of the Future”, which largely meant talking about <a href="http://dasher360.com" target="_blank">Dasher 360</a> and how it’s progressed from buildings to infrastructure and onwards to factories.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a44e86f9200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Me talking Dasher" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Me talking Dasher" src="/assets/image_380329.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a49c5ac3200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="My audience at AIF" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="My audience at AIF" src="/assets/image_784213.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Romeo Sanchez from our consulting team shared this photo of me talking (thanks, Romeo!):</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a44e8703200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="219" title="Presenting at AIF" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Presenting at AIF" src="/assets/image_230424.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>On the exhibit floor, the VRED team had created an HDR scan of the environment and set up a cluster to do realtime raytracing of a new electric SUV from NIO. Check the screen above the car for a comparison between virtual and real.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a44e870a200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="The NIO in reality and VRED" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="The NIO in reality and VRED" src="/assets/image_93938.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>I had to leave fairly promptly after my session to get to my flight for Barcelona, which thankfully went smoothly.</p><p>After <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2019/03/generative-design-workshop-for-sweco-in-stockholm.html" target="_blank">last week’s windowless room in Stockholm</a>, the hotel gods were smiling on me. On checking into the Barcelona Princess – the hotel right across from the conference centre hosting OTx EMEA – the person at the hotel reception said “you ordered a room with a view…”</p><p>Me: “I did?” (Thinking: <u>that’s</u> why the cheapest room on offer was so expensive…)</p><p>Receptionist (after consulting with her manager): “We’ve given you an upgrade to a master suite.”</p><p>Me: “Yay!” (I don’t know whether this was said aloud or not.)</p><p>It turns out my suite has a baclony with a hot tub. Woohoo!</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a49c5ad8200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="My suite's balcony" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="My suite's balcony" src="/assets/image_771501.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>This would have been amazing, were it not for the fact that a) I’m staying just one night, b) it’s raining and c) the hot tub is empty. Oh well – I really shouldn’t complain, I have plenty of windows.</p><p>After dropping my bags I headed across to the OTx dinner reception with its awards ceremony. I had the good fortune to catch up with (from left to right, not including me) Nono Martinez, Lilli Smith and Zach Kron, who were all here to talk to attendees about Refinery.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a44e8714200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Hanging with the Refinery team" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Hanging with the Refinery team" src="/assets/image_202443.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>The band the OTx team had arranged was fantastic: a cover band with genuine talent and really great breadth.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a44e8749200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="The band was excellent" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="The band was excellent" src="/assets/image_528003.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>In the morning I’ll be presenting about Autodesk Research projects related to Generative Design, before heading across to London to help out with the Dynamo Hackathon there.</p>
