<p>It’s Good Friday, so much of the world will be offline today, but I thought I’d post quickly on some (good) news that may be of interest to people.</p>  <p>The ReCap team has <a href="http://tenlinks.com/news/autodesk-releases-recap-connect-partnership-program" target="_blank">officially launched a new partner program</a>. This provides access to a number of mechanisms for integrating with or harnessing Autodesk ReCap products and services.</p>  <p>The <strong>Capture Codec Kit</strong> is primarily for importing custom point cloud formats – something important for hardware manufacturers, particularly – into Autodesk ReCap on the desktop.</p>  <p><strong>Embedded ReCap OEM</strong> allows generated or post-processed point cloud data to be brought into Autodesk’s design products that support the RCS format. This looks like it would be very handy for my Kinect integration with AutoCAD 2015, for instance.</p>  <p>The third option is the <strong>ReCap Photo Web API</strong>, a web-service API into the back-end photo processing system that drives Photo on ReCap 360 and 123D Catch. You can use this RESTful API to create and manage projects reconstructing 3D models from photographs. Being able to process these projects programmatically – and using additional information such as camera positions – brings some really interesting capabilities for application developers. I’d like to see how it might be used in conjunction with Augmented Reality applications, for instance. Interesting times!</p>  <p>If you’re interested in finding out more about being part of this program, be sure to <a href="mailto:Dominique.Pouliquen@autodesk.com" target="_blank">contact Dominique Pouliquen</a>.</p>
