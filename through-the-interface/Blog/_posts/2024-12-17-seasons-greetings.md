<p>Here we are again, at the end of another year. This time last year <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2023/12/seasons-greetings.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">I posted a compilation of Autodesk’s holiday greeting messages</a>, and I thought I should do the same for 2024. This year’s are very nice: I’ve been using the one with fairy lights for my Zoom backdrop for the last week or two, and it’s been going down a (winter?) storm.</p>

<p>Last year I reflected on my personal year ahead a little bit - and how our son would be studying in Baltimore for the academic year between 2024 and 2025. As it happens we’re heading across as a family to DC on Friday, where we’ll visit the US capital city, Delaware beaches, Amish country and Maryland over a two-week period.</p>
<p>I’ll be a bit sad not to be on the slopes in Switzerland - as it looks like we will actually have decent snow over Christmas! - but then I did get the chance to snowboard with my good friend and colleague, Dagmara Szkurlat, for at least one day this week before we head abroad.</p>

<p>And I know it’s going to be a really fun trip, especially as I’ll get to spend some time with old friends (formerly) from the UK, Mark Webb and Duncan Lofting, both of whom have settled on the east coast of the US.</p>
<p>One thing that’s going to be a struggle is to finish this year’s <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2024" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Advent of Code</a>. So far it’s been a lot of fun - and yes, I’m doing it in JavaScript rather than in Rust (which I always hope to attempt). In related news our eldest son - the one in Baltimore - is doing AoC for the first time, and using Rust! So maybe now I don’t need to. :-)</p>
<p>A particularly interesting turn-up was on Day 16, when one of the challenges resonated a great deal with our research into human-centric spatial analysis. Maybe we’re on the right track, after all?</p>

<p>And with that I will close out the year. All the best to any of you who are celebrating at this time of year: may you have a wonderful festive break with those dear to you. I hope you come back refreshed and have an amazing start to 2025.</p>
