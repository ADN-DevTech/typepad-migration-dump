<p>Late last week I received the news that <a href="https://issuu.com/rumoer/docs/rumoer_73_v2_digital_one_page/10" target="_blank">an article co-written by Rhys Goldstein, Divyae Mittal and myself</a> has been published in the <a href="https://bouttudelft.nl/rumoer/" target="_blank">RuMoer</a>, <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/en/" target="_blank">TU Delft</a>’s periodical for the building technologist. Divyae – who is wrapping up his Master’s degree at TU Delft, in spite of the CORVID-19 pandemic – reached out as his thesis project makes use of both <a href="https://autodesk.github.io/sydevs/" target="_blank">SyDEVS</a> – a discrete event simulation framework Rhys has written and open sourced – and <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2019/03/the-space-analysis-package-for-dynamo-and-refinery-is-now-available.html" target="_blank">the Space Analysis Dynamo package</a>. Divyae thought it worth covering both packages and his thesis in the RuMoer, and we wholeheartedly agreed!</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a52309c4200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="253" title="RuMoer article" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="RuMoer article" src="/assets/image_891302.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>While my name is on the article, Rhys and Divyae really did all the hard work. I proof-read it a few times and commented, but they did all the heavy lifting.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2025d9b48ff69200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="253" title="More RuMoer " style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="More RuMoer " src="/assets/image_614147.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Many thanks to both Rhys and Divyae – as well as to Prateek Wahi and the rest of the editorial staff – for making this happen. The RuMoer is a really interesting publication, and well worth reading when it comes out (I’ll certainly be doing my best to, from here on out).</p>
