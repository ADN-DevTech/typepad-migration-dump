<p>In <a href="https://youtu.be/aYBKNlg98h4" rel="noopener" target="_blank">today’s episode</a> we go more retro than ever, dusting off an old 1970s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Pong</a> console from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_first_generation_home_video_game_consoles" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Inno-Hit</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20278804cf5a7200d-pi" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Pong" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_669334.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="Pong" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>We played all 10 of the games on the console, which certainly made the editing simpler than usual: no speeding up needed, at all!</p>
<p>My 12-year-old daughter kindly joined me off-screen (out of respect for her privacy) for the 2-player games. It was fun to have someone join me.</p>

<p>As mentioned in the video, my kids have already played this console for hours: the games really are timeless!</p>
