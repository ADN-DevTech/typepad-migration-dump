If you can put together a proposal (which shouldn’t be more than 1,000 words) by then, you may still be able to participate.</p>  <p>As a reminder, Autodesk is hosting the 2-week workshop in our downtown San Francisco offices from <strong>March 9-20</strong>, and will pay the hotel costs for 1-2 people per company. <a href="http://autodeskcloudaccelerator.com" target="_blank">Get more information here</a>.</p>
