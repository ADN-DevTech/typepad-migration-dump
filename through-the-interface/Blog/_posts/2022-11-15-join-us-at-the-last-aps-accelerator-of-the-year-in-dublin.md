<p>The Autodesk Platform Services – formerly known as Forge – team is holding <a href="https://forge.autodesk.com/accelerator-program" rel="noopener" target="_blank">one last Accelerator</a> in Europe before the holiday break. It’s going to be from December 5-9 in Dublin, Ireland. You can <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/autodesk-platform-services-aps-accelerator-dublin-december-5-9-2022-registration-440477168067" rel="noopener" target="_blank">register until November 28</a>.</p>

<p>As always these events are a fantastic way to kickstart any new project using APS (Forge) or to accelerate feature development of an existing one. It’s basically 5 free days of consulting from Autodesk – all you have to pay for are travel and accommodation.</p>
<p>I was already planning a last trip (of the year) to the UK for the following week, and so have decided to tag on a few days in Dublin beforehand: while not part of the APS team, I do have some experience working with a few different APS APIs, and can certainly give pointers to folks working on digital twin projects similar to <a href="https://dasher360.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Dasher</a>.</p>
<p>Right now I expect to be there in person from December 7-9, although I’ll do my best to be available virtually for the beginning of the week, too.</p>
<p>Dublin is magical at this time of year, so I’m definitely looking forward to the trip, and probably a few pints of the black stuff.</p>

<p>(Full disclosure: apparently Autodesk Dublin is celebrating Christmas on the 9th, so there may be an additional reason for me to be visiting the city. But that’s just fortuitous timing – I consider this to be the definition of a win-win[-win?]. :-)</p>
<p><em><strong>Update:</strong></em></p>
<p>My friend and colleague Silvio Guido pointed out that there&#39;s one more Accelerator the following week in São Paolo. I&#39;ve adjusted the language to reflect the fact Dublin&#39;s is the last Accelerator of the year in Europe.</p>
