<p>In <a href="https://youtu.be/H8Nb7xdQxyM" target="_blank">this week’s episode</a> we look at two games: one from 1986 and one from 2021. That’s right: we’re playing <a href="https://www.c64-wiki.com/wiki/Super_Cycle" target="_blank">Super Cycle</a> from the 80s and <a href="https://carletonhandley.itch.io/runn-n-gunn" target="_blank">Runn ‘n’ Gunn</a> which was just released last week. How crazy is that?</p><p>I did what I could to adjust the settings on my TV and on my phone to get better colours from the screen recording (thanks to Fernando Malard for <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp9u6D5mvfw" target="_blank">the YouTube link</a>!) but I do see there was some auto-focus strangeness. I’ll try to get that fixed for episode #16.</p><p style="text-align: center"><br /></p><p style="text-align: center"><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="283" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/H8Nb7xdQxyM" width="560"></iframe></p><p style="text-align: center"><br /></p><p style="text-align: left">Both games shown in today’s episode were lots of fun to play. Here’s <a href="http://www.zzap64.co.uk/cgi-bin/displaypage.pl?issue=018&amp;page=112&amp;thumbstart=0&amp;magazine=zzap" target="_blank">the Zzap64! magazine review of Super Cycle</a>:</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20263e98da26b200b-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="Super Cycle in Zzap64! magazine" border="0" height="500" src="/assets/image_448018.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="Super Cycle in Zzap64! magazine" width="348" /></a></p><p>While I really enjoyed playing these two games, I could – as usual – use a little more practice. I’ll be playing both again, for sure!</p>
