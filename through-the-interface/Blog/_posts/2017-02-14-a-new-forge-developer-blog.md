<p>The Forge team (many of whom I worked with back when I was part of the Autodesk Developer Network organisation) have created <a href="https://forge.autodesk.com/blog" target="_blank">a new developer blog focused on all things Forge</a>.</p> <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201bb09792de5970d-pi" target="_blank"><img title="The Forge developer blog" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 30px auto; border-left: 0px; display: block; padding-right: 0px" border="0" alt="The Forge developer blog" src="/assets/image_754812.jpg" width="500" height="390"></a></p> <p>You’ll find a lot of the usual suspects who contributed to the Cloud &amp; Mobile DevBlog (in fact that particular blog’s content has already been migrated across to the new site with the Forge branding). I expect lots of helpful information will be posted during the coming weeks/months/years. Be sure to bookmark it and check back regularly.</p> <p>Now if only I could find out how to search the blog’s content… hopefully I’m missing something obvious (yes, other than Google ;-). I’ll post back here when I find out how that works.</p>
