<p>On Tuesday morning, the beginning of the first day proper of Autodesk’s DevCon Europe 2025 in Amsterdam, attendees started to arrive at the historic <a href="https://beursvanberlage.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Beurs van Berlage</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_528719.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Beurs van Berlage." border="0" height="500" src="/assets/image_528719.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Beurs van Berlage" width="375" /></a></p>
<p>It’s really a beautiful conference venue.<a href="/assets/image_357488.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="A great expo space." border="0" height="500" src="/assets/image_357488.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="A great expo space" width="375" /></a></p>
<p>It wasn&#39;t long before I was catching up with old friends, including past and present Autodesk employees.<a href="/assets/image_907919.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Philippe and Cyrille." border="0" height="500" src="/assets/image_907919.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Philippe and Cyrille" width="375" /></a></p>
<p>The Piro brothers are regulars at Autodesk events, although they&#39;re now there with different companies.<a href="/assets/image_807099.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Avec les freres." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_807099.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Avec les freres" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>For the first day&#39;s general session employees were asked to use an overflow room with a large screen.<a href="/assets/image_491216.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="The general session overflow." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_491216.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="The general session overflow" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>I ended up standing at the back.<a href="/assets/image_341739.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="From the back." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_341739.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="From the back" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>I propped my machine on a table holding a scale model of the value, so I could catch up on some work. The table wasn&#39;t locked into place, which made for several funny moments as people leaned on it from one side or another and it started to move.<a href="/assets/image_936548.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="A model of the building." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_936548.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="A model of the building" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>I didn&#39;t attend m any sessions, but I did stop by a few. Here&#39;s one by Stephen Brockwell from Esri.<a href="/assets/image_472134.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Session by Esri." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_472134.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Session by Esri" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>The main exhibition space - which was absolutely fantastic - filled up nicely at lunchtime.<a href="/assets/image_211941.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Feeding the masses." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_211941.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Feeding the masses" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>In the afternoon I was “room captain&quot; for the room I&#39;d be presenting in at 3:30pm. It was a long, narrow room holding 60 or so people.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_770010.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Me presenting." border="0" height="500" src="/assets/image_770010.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Me presenting" width="375" /></a></p>
<p>The presentation before mine was by Srinath Jonnagaddala from our PDMS organization.<a href="/assets/image_280169.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Srinath presenting." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_280169.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Srinath presenting" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Here&#39;s a photo of my own session that James Awe kindly snapped. I was really happy with the turnout.<a href="/assets/image_454611.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Me presenting." border="0" height="500" src="/assets/image_454611.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Me presenting" width="375" /></a></p>
<p>The general session room was also used for classes. It&#39;s such a gorgeous space.<a href="/assets/image_958529.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Adam in the big room." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_958529.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Adam in the big room" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>As the evening drew in, people started to head across to the evening&#39;s reception venue at <a href="https://strand-zuid.nl/en/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Strandzuid</a>. <a href="/assets/image_48252.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Leaving for the party." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_48252.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Leaving for the party" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>External people got to go there by boat, internal folks by bus. With 20-20 hindsight I would have gained some drinking time by taking the Metro with Pete Storey (who is a proper local, at this stage).</p>
<p>There were a number of people with these paddles, to show us the way. James Awe and I had some interesting discussions about the number of S’s - it’s apparently not wrong to have the double-S, but then neither is it very common.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_440004.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" height="500" src="/assets/image_440004.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Busses" width="375" /></a></p>
<p>There was an interesting building as we got off the bus. I haven&#39;t yet figured out which it is.<a href="/assets/image_81687.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Arriving off the bus." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_81687.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Arriving off the bus" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>I didn’t take many photos of the party, but it was really a beautiful setting.<a href="/assets/image_692763.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Drinks by the water." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_692763.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Drinks by the water" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>It&#39;s always a fantastic chance to catch up with old friends.<a href="/assets/image_154601.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Out on the water." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_154601.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Out on the water" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>James Awe and I headed out for a final couple of drinks - after picking up additional clothing layers, as it was cooler than I expected.<a href="/assets/image_772332.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Bottom of the stairs." border="0" height="500" src="/assets/image_772332.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Bottom of the stairs" width="375" /></a></p>
<p>There&#39;s nothing very special about the bars in the area - it&#39;s all very touristy - but it was fun to spend some time catching up with James.<a href="/assets/image_961980.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Red light bar." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_961980.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Red light bar" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>The next morning started with the second day&#39;s general session.<a href="/assets/image_356974.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Second day general session." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_356974.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Second day general session" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>This time we were encouraged to join in the main room.<a href="/assets/image_270393.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Adam and Kevin." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_270393.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Adam and Kevin" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Ben Cochran was the main host.<a href="/assets/image_838981.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_838981.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Ben" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Vikram Dutt took to the stage afterwards.<a href="/assets/image_489535.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_489535.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Vikram" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Emile Kfouri hosted a panel with development partners.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_474712.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_474712.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Emile" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>And Joe Speicher talked about sustainability - a hot topic in the Netherlands.<a href="/assets/image_260016.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_260016.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Joe" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>I had some work to catch up on - we have an important deadline this week, on top of everything else that&#39;s been going on - which was actually a challenge to meet: I had to record an offline presentation, but I hadn&#39;t realised how echoey the Beurs van Berlage is. It&#39;s brick everywhere with really high ceilings: meetings are fine, but recording something without a special microphone is a challenge. In the end I found a small space on the top floor - I think it was some kind of staff kitchenette - that I managed to use for the 10 minutes I needed to complete the recording.</p>
<p>Afterwards I headed downstairs in Meet Berlage for a special event celebrating our most important partners who we’ve worked with for upwards of 25 years. It was a real trip down memory lane: I don&#39;t work actively with our development partners, these days, but they hold a special place in my heart.<a href="/assets/image_528455.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_528455.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Cyrille" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Cyrille and Ben gave well-deserved rewards to all our old-time partners present.<a href="/assets/image_470472.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="25 year ADN veterans." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_470472.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="25 year ADN veterans" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Then came a very special moment, where we celebrated Jeremy Tammik&#39;s upcoming retirement.<a href="/assets/image_260553.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_260553.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Jeremy" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>I&#39;ve know Jeremy for nearly 30 years, so it was really a huge moment for me and others who know him.<a href="/assets/image_240818.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_240818.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Chatting" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>I&#39;m happy that Jeremy will remain relatively local to me - I will be making more effort to see him, moving forwards.<a href="/assets/image_92002.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_92002.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="The gang" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Walking back to the main hall I got to see the huge screen from behind...<a href="/assets/image_462681.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Behind the main stage." border="0" height="500" src="/assets/image_462681.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Behind the main stage" width="375" /></a></p>
<p>... and from the front.<a href="/assets/image_874968.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="From the front." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_874968.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="From the front" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>It&#39;s a really great space.<a href="/assets/image_819789.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Quite the room." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_819789.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Quite the room" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Back in the exhibition hall there were some people trying out the Apple Vision Pro. (I finally got around to trying it myself - an impressive device, although probably not worth the price-tag.)<a href="/assets/image_851567.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Apple Vision Pro." border="0" height="500" src="/assets/image_851567.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Apple Vision Pro" width="375" /></a></p>
<p>Many, many people wanted to wish Jeremy well, as you&#39;d expect. He&#39;s been such an important part of the developer community, and has helped untold people resolve technical issues.<a href="/assets/image_518103.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Shaking hands." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_518103.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Shaking hands" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>I had to take one more selfie before heading to the main station.<a href="/assets/image_797707.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Kean and Jeremy." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_797707.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Kean and Jeremy" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>I got as far as boarding a train before getting a message that my flight was delayed. I managed to pop back to the venue for the group photo - I’ll post that once it gets sent over.</p>
<p>The D gates in Schipol has an awesome living wall: gotta love those biophillic design elements!<a href="/assets/image_967348.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><br /><img alt="A living wall." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_967348.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="A living wall" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>I decided to eat dinner at the airport. I&#39;m heading to the UK, so thought I&#39;d warm my digestive system up for the trip.<a href="/assets/image_548933.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Dinner at the airport." border="0" height="500" src="/assets/image_548933.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Dinner at the airport" width="375" /></a></p>
<p>My flight ended up being cancelled, but I&#39;m booked on another flight this evening.<a href="/assets/image_506233.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_506233.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Cancelled" width="500" /></a>If I’d known ahead of time I’d have gone for dinner with my Autodesk colleagues. At this stage I’m just happy to have a chance of getting to London with only a 4-hour delay. The plane for my replacement flight has just arrived - let’s see!</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_815798.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="The next flight is about to begin." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_815798.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="The next flight is about to begin" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>It was lovely seeing so many old friends - as ever - at this year’s DevCon. Thanks to everyone who took the time to say “Hi”, and I hope those who attended my class found it useful. I’m now looking forward to the APS pre-conference day at AU 2025 in Nashville.</p>
