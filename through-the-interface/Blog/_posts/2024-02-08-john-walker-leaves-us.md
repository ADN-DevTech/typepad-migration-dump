<p>I woke up this morning to the sad news that Autodesk’s founder and first CEO, John Walker, has died. You can find the announcement and brief obituary <a href="https://scanalyst.fourmilab.ch/t/john-walker-1949-2024/4305">here</a>.</p>
<p>I can’t claim to have known John very well, despite us living less than 15km from each other in Switzerland. I did spend a very memorable evening with him back in September of 2008, which led to this series of posts about Autodesk’s early history:</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://keanw.com/2008/09/an-interview--1.html">Part 2 - AutoCAD's architecture &amp; APIs</a></li>
<li><a href="https://keanw.com/2008/09/an-interview--2.html">Part 3 - Autodesk's eco-system and strategy</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.keanw.com/2008/10/an-interview-wi.html">Part 4 - Past and future opportunities</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s a photo I took of John after we’d talked for a few hours:</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_140257.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="John Walker holding an M9900 and the prototype hardcover manual for AutoCAD 2.1.jpg" src="/assets/image_140257.jpg" alt="John Walker holding an M9900 and the prototype hardcover manual for AutoCAD 2 1" width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>I only interacted with John a few times since that time, one of them being after I posted <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2021/03/floppy-friday-22.html">this Floppy Friday episode covering his early experiments on the Commodore 64</a>.</p>
<p>John was relentlessly curious, highly opinionated and super smart. He lit up like a proud father when talking about his baby (Autodesk), which turned 42 just a few days before he passed. Without John there would have been no Autodesk, my career would have been very different, and I would neither have settled in Neuchatel nor met the love of my life. RIP.</p>
