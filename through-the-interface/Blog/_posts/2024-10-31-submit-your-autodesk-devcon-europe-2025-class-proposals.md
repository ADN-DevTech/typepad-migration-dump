<p>As I mentioned after <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2024/10/au-2024-days-0-and-1.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the announcement at AU 2024</a>, I was thrilled to see an <a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Faps.autodesk.com%2Fautodesk-devcon-2025&amp;data=05%7C02%7CKean.Walmsley%40autodesk.com%7Cdd547f67e10346d9393f08dcf4fe4ec3%7C67bff79e7f914433a8e5c9252d2ddc1d%7C0%7C0%7C638654620277467698%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=92qAPyg3yZkkQq1GoY%2FH4%2FjYu%2BXM69Gwp7O59fUMzyU%3D&amp;reserved=0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Autodesk DevCon</a> happening back in the fine city of Amsterdam. It’ll be held from May 20-21, 2025.</p>

<p>The last one I attended was the week (maybe a few days more) after I joined Autodesk, back in August of 1995. I wasn’t actually presenting at that first one, if memory serves me right, I was assisting my colleague Jim Tinney with his presentation about the Autodesk WorkCenter API.</p>
<p>The event was held in a super-fancy Japanese hotel in Amsterdam - at least it certainly seemed that fancy to me, at the time, as I wasn’t used to such things. I suspect it was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel_Okura_Amsterdam" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Hotel Okura</a>, but I can’t be 100% sure, at this stage.</p>
<p>I don’t have any photos from back then, but here’s one that was taken a year or two later, when I was on another trip to Amsterdam. (I know it wasn’t from 1995 as I still had long hair when I first joined Autodesk.)</p>

<p>I know I have the conference agenda somewhere - I’ll try to dig it up. I was able to find a PowerPoint deck from the following year which had basically the same design:</p>

<p>Anyway, fast-forwarding 30 years back to the present... today I went ahead and submitted a class proposal - talking about integrating WebAssembly with APS applications - that I hope will be accepted. Either way I’m going to try my hardest to be there.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://adndata.autodesk.io/events/120/cfp" rel="noopener" target="_blank">submit your own proposals</a> until November 15th.</p>
<p>This should give a sense of what the APS team is looking for in proposals:</p>
