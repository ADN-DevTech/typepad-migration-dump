<p>I’m sitting at Geneva airport, waiting to board a Swiss flight to the UK.</p>
<p>I’ve been hacking away in Python – and now IronPython – for the last few days, which has been very interesting. Here’s a quick update on that…</p>
<p>I’m now managing to save out PNGs of the de-skewed portions of perspective photographs with a high degree of quality, if not with exceptional speed. I’ll post a little on the approaches I tried out – and settled on – when I get the chance.</p>
<p>It’s now time to get the code working inside AutoCAD: I have the basic project set up, and am now working through various minor compatibility issues to get the (pure Python) code to execute inside AutoCAD.</p>
<p>The reason I’m going across to England has nothing at all to do with this, of course. I’m heading over to spend a couple of days with Morgan Motor Company, which is extremely exciting. I have a 1/2 day Morgan 3 Wheeler driving course organised, which I’ll follow with a factory tour and a meeting with the design team to understand more about how MMC uses Autodesk software.</p>
<p>I’m expecting it to be a lot of fun. :-)</p>
