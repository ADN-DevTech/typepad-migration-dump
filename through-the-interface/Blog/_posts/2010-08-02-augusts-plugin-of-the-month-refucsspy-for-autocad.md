<p>Just a quick note to say Glenn Ryan’s latest contribution, RefUcsSpy, is now live as August’s Plugin of the Month. I posted <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2010/07/preview-of-augusts-plugin-of-the-month-refucsspy.html">a preview of the application</a> a few weeks ago, and you can now get the compiled plugin with complete source project from the <a href="http://labs.autodesk.com/utilities/ADN_plugins">Plugin of the Month</a> page on <a href="http://labs.autodesk.com">Autodesk Labs</a>. Thanks, Glenn! :-)</p>  <p>You’ll note the posted plugin only claims support for AutoCAD 2009 onwards. This is because it relies on the Task Dialog implementation introduced in that version of AutoCAD. If you would like to get it working for prior versions of AutoCAD, you’ll find an alternative implementation using standard Windows UI components (i.e. a MessageBox), which Glenn has kindly provided in the DocData.cs file. If you have trouble getting this built, let me know: I’ll put something together to post/send out.</p>
