<p>If you’re working in the BIM space and are thinking about developing a cloud-based application that works with BIM 360 and Forge, there’s <a href="https://bim360hackathon.devpost.com/" target="_blank">an online hackathon</a> that may be of interest to you. In fact it may well be of interest even if you’re not thinking of building such an app in the immediate future: these events are a great opportunity to learn about Autodesk platform technology and consider whether it might be useful at some point down the line.</p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201bb09b6d7f5970d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="119" title="BIM 360 Hackathon" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="BIM 360 Hackathon" src="/assets/image_435276.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>The hackathon kicked off a week ago on August 1st and runs until <strong>September 30th</strong>. You have until then to form a team, build an app based on BIM 360 and submit it to the Autodesk App Store. If the app gets approved and posted to the store before the end of October, you’ll be eligible for a slice of the $20,000 prize (each entrant can earn up to $500). Oh, and the hackathon is free to enter, of course.</p><p>If you don’t feel like you can commit to building an app – or just want to learn more before you enter – then check out the <a href="https://bim360hackathon.devpost.com/details/webinars" target="_blank">webinar schedule</a>. They start next week – on August 15th – and run until August 24th. And they’ll be recorded for later access, too.</p><p>Here’s a summary of the webinar topics:</p><ul><li>Introduction to BIM 360, the business opportunity and the Autodesk App store</li><ul><li>A brief Introduction to the BIM 360 platform and the Autodesk App Store and the business opportunities they enable for developers/companies.</li></ul><li>Introduction to BIM360 and Forge API</li><ul><li>A brief Introduction to the BIM 360 platform and Forge API.</li></ul><li>Authentication and Data Management API</li><ul><li>Authentication is the open standard used across the Forge Platform for token-based authentication and authorization. <a href="https://developer.autodesk.com/en/docs/oauth/v2/overview/">Learn more</a></li><li>The Data Management API provides a unified and consistent way to access data across A360, BIM 360 Fusion 360, and the Object Storage Service. <a href="https://developer.autodesk.com/en/docs/data/v2/overview/">Learn more<strong> </strong></a></li></ul><li>Introduction to Model Derivative API</li><ul><li>The Model Derivative API enables users to represent and share their designs in different formats, as well as to extract valuable metadata.
