<p>The Autodesk Tandem team have kindly invited me to join <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/webinars/tandem-webinar-march9" rel="noopener" target="_blank">their regular webinar</a> – coming up on March 9th – to talk about the history of Project Dasher and to participate in a more future-centric discussion with Bob Bray and Tim Kelly.</p>
<p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202942f9adbee200c-pi" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Tandem webinar" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_868641.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="Tandem webinar" width="437" /></a></p>
<p>Here’s the description of the webinar. Even I want to attend, it sounds so interesting! ;-)</p>
<blockquote>
<h4><span style="font-weight: bold;"><em>From the lens of a software architect, learn why digital twin is key to the future of build</em></span></h4>
<p><strong>What will it take to win the digital twin race? </strong></p>
<p>Get a front row seat and join our very own Kean Walmsley, software architect for Autodesk Research, to learn about what it will take to stay ahead of the curve and win with digital twins.<br />Kean is joined by the Autodesk Tandem team as they take you behind the scenes and discuss how we begin to value the importance and full potential of BIM, digital-twins and IoT to embrace the future of build.<br />Kean’s work at Autodesk Research on Project Dasher, using Autodesk Forge to explore BIM &amp; IoT as well as working on Generative Design in the AEC space has paved the way to regular engagement with Autodesk’s developer and the computational design communities, providing valuable insights into the evolution of technology.<br />We look forward to seeing you there and, as always, we will reserve time for questions.<br />If you&#39;re interested but not able to attend this live webinar, register and we&#39;ll send you a link to the recording!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Perhaps most interestingly, Tim tells me he’s going to share some early work the Tandem team has been doing to integrate Dasher-like capabilities into the product. I’ve had a sneak peek, and I’m really excited to see the work the team has done.</p>
<p>To see the future of Dasher - and this is still very much a work-in-progress, so I really want to emphasize <em>future</em> - please do <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/webinars/tandem-webinar-march9" rel="noopener" target="_blank">join us for this webinar</a>!</p>
