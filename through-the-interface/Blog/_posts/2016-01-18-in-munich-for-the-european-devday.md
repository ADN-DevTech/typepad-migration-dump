<p>The snow arrived, at last, and it’s amazing.</p>

<p>I spent the weekend on the slopes with my family before heading across to Zurich to hop on the last flight to Munich, last night. I had a sinking feeling, on arriving at the airport, as the information board said “More information at 20:15”. This is generally not a good thing for a flight that’s scheduled to leave at 20:15.</p>
<p>In the end it was a mere 45 minute delay – which was quite the relief – which gave me some time to watch another episode of the excellent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Robot_(TV_series)" target="_blank">Mr. Robot</a> (yes, finally a thoroughly decent show about hackers) and to read a few pages of the so far very funny <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00EF8Z32I" target="_blank">Off to be the Wizard</a>.</p>
<p>When I finally made it to the hotel in Munich, I got slightly sidetracked in the lobby bar – catching up with old friends – and managed to wheel my luggage up to my room by about half-past midnight.</p>
<p>This morning I’ve so far managed to grab a quick bite and to snap a quick photo from my hotel room.</p>

<p>Now it’s off for the main event… today is the conference proper while the rest of the week will be spent looking at people’s development problems and – in particular – helping kick-start their use of our cloud-based APIs.</p>
