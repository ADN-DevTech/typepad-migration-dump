<p>My sister sent this one through to me, and I think it's just great: <a href="http://www.ecofont.eu/ecofont_en.html">a font with holes in</a>, allowing you to save up to 20% on ink and therefore reduce your impact on the environment.</p> <p>Here's what the font looks like inside AutoCAD, to give you an idea:</p> <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2011168577cc2970c-pi"><img style="border-top-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px" height="114" alt="ecofont - the font with holes" src="/assets/image_884034.jpg" width="471" border="0"></a> </p> <p>I don't think the eco-innovators have very much to teach the CAD world, however: we've been using dashed linetypes for years! :-)</p> <p>I'd be very interested to hear how the readers of this blog have made changes to their (or their customers') work processes in the interests of either economy or ecology. The obvious one would be to keep the data in digital form - avoiding paper - although for many reasons this isn't always an option. Please post a comment!</p> <p>That's it for today. I'm now on my way home after being on the road for 2 weeks (a looong trip). Once I'm back in the office I'm planning a series to cover some of the API changes in the recently-announced AutoCAD 2010. Watch this space...</p>
