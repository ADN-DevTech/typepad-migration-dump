<p>This may well be my last post of 2023, so I thought I’d take the time to say a quick thank you to all of who have read and commented on this blog (whether here or on social media channels) over the course of the year. I don’t post as much as I once did - due to the nature of my role, these days - but every interaction with the broader community is precious to me.</p>
<p>So here’s a little GIF of Autodesk’s seasonal greetings cards to say “thanks”. :-)</p>

<p>Looking forward to next year… we’ve just heard that our eldest son will be heading to Baltimore towards the end of 2024 - in an election year, of all things! - to spend the 3rd year of his Life Sciences Engineering bachelor&#39;s (so far at EPFL in Switzerland) as an undergraduate exchange student at Johns Hopkins University in their bio-medical engineering program. He apparently managed to get one of only two spots open to 3rd year EPFL undergrads, so he&#39;s very happy.</p>

<p>I’m so very proud of - and excited for - him. I’ll also be looking for any opportunity to come across to the DC area to spend some time with him, so feel free to send any and all suggestions you might have my way. I’m nothing if not opportunistic when it comes to seeing my family. :-)</p>
