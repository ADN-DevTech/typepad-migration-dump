<p>I’ve been invited to talk about <a href="https://dasher360.com" target="_blank">Project Dasher</a> at the KEA BIM Café Talk on Wednesday of this week. Many thanks to Aske Strandberg for organising and moderating this event.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20263e96540e4200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="125" title="KEA talk" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="KEA talk" src="/assets/image_359292.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>It’s being held online (of course) at <strong>4pm CET on Wednesday September 16th</strong>. The session is primarily targeted at students from <a href="https://kea.dk/en/" target="_blank">KEA</a> – the Copenhagen School of Design and Technology – but <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:ugcPost:6709562640869462016/" target="_blank">guests are very welcome</a>. <a href="https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=bjwM0SjCREmLamBnxq_jyRvTi1TF2VZBojsbE7qIOFNUNDc0TUlRN0pIMENONzEyTjVNQTJOVVZTTC4u" target="_blank">If you’d like to join, feel free to sign up here</a>.</p><p>I’ll be sharing a number of <u>really</u> cool enhancements I’ve been making to Dasher during the pandemic-related travel ban – only some of which I’ve had the chance to blog about, to-date – so I think there’ll be something of interest for anyone interested in implementing digital twins using Autodesk’s Forge platform. Please note that the session is primarily intended for students, so I’ll also be talking a bit about my own career journey and the future opportunity for students interested in working in this space.</p><p>So if you’re interested in becoming an honorary KEAn (the name I’m now giving to students and alumni of KEA ;-) then please do sign up. I promise it will be interesting!</p>
