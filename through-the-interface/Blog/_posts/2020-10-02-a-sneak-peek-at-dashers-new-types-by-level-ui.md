<p>This week has been a little crazy in terms of presentations. On Monday it kicked off with an internal project review followed by a presentation to a class of Masters students from the University of Southern California (it was a lunchtime session for them, so it was a late evening one for me).</p><p>It wrapped up yesterday with the <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2020/09/register-for-thursdays-sdsc-connect-event-for-free.html" target="_blank">generative design session for the Swiss Data Science Center</a>, which despite a few technical hitches (not on my side, thankfully) seemed to go pretty well. I was told there were upwards of 400 attendees registered for the event, but I have no idea how many showed up for my session.</p><p>Anyway, after a busy week I’m very happy to be enjoying one more companywide holiday today: Autodesk granted a couple of these back in June, and we have another today. The company realises its employees are often working longer hours during the pandemic, and even if they’re not able to they’re feeling more than a little “Zoomed out”. It really is a great place to work (the fact I think this <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2020/08/25-years-with-autodesk.html" target="_blank">may not come as a huge surprise</a>).</p><p>Despite it being a holiday, I do feel the need to publish something on this blog – just one post a week doesn’t feel like enough, somehow. But as I don’t want to invest a huge amount of effort in preparing it, here are a few screenshots of a <a href="https://dasher360.com" target="_blank">Project Dasher</a> feature I’ve been hinting at – and have even demo’ed to a few people – over the last few weeks, the “Types By Level” panel:</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2026be416c3a5200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="312" title="TypesByLevel for NEST" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="TypesByLevel for NEST" src="/assets/image_390445.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>As we’re getting really close to the installation of the MX3D bridge in Amsterdam, I’ve also been spending some time getting the sensors modelled accurately and the test data connected into Dasher. Here’s how the panel looks for the bridge:</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20263e96a93fe200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="312" title="TypesByLevel for MX3D" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="TypesByLevel for MX3D" src="/assets/image_72497.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>I’m not actually going to say more about it, for now: next week we’ll dig into how it works and what it’s all about.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20263e96a93fe200b-pi" target="_blank"><br></a></p>
