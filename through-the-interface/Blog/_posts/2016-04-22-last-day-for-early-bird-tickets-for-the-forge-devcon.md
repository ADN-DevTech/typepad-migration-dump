Fort Mason is going to be transformed into a Mecca for software developers serving the AEC and Manufacturing industries (or people simply wanting to know more about the Autodesk platform technology).</p> <p>As I’ve mentioned a few times, I’m in charge of the <a href="http://forge.autodesk.com/tracks-and-speakers/" target="_blank">speaker track for Virtual and Augmented Reality</a>. We have some great speakers lined up: <a href="https://twitter.com/auradeluxe" target="_blank">Tony Parisi</a> (one of the inventors of VRML, back in the day) will be talking about <a href="https://webvr.info/" target="_blank">WebVR</a> and <a href="https://www.khronos.org/gltf" target="_blank">glTF</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/joshcarpenter" target="_blank">Josh Carpenter</a> will be talking about User Experience design for VR, and you’ll hear from Autodesk on VR-related technology such as the View &amp; Data API, A360 cloud rendering, Stingray, Project Expo and VRED. And we have a *really* interesting sponsor lined up (we’re still in discussions on that one, but watch this space… :-).</p> <p>The exhibition area is going to have “villages” for each industry (or technology that crossed industries, in the case of VR/AR and IoT). The VR/AR village (which we’re dubbing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaverse" target="_blank">The Metaverse</a>) will have a bunch of exhibits for people to try out firsthand: we’ll have multi-player and collaborative VR systems on show, as well a technology for “armchair” positional tracking. And our Office of the CTO will have a bunch of the VR-related prototypes for people to try, to give people a really good sense for what’s on the horizon.</p> <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b8d1cdff54970c-pi" target="_blank"><img title="Let's build the future together" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 30px auto; border-left: 0px; display: block; padding-right: 0px" border="0" alt="Let's build the future together" src="/assets/image_117989.jpg" width="504" height="368"></a></p> <p>So, if you think this all sounds fun (bearing in mind this is just one track… we have a whole lot going on in the other tracks, too) then there’s still time to sign up.</p> <p>Today – April 22 – is the last day you can avail yourself of the early bird discount (I assume that’s Pacific time, so we still have several hours to go). Don’t worry, though: the standard price – whether for standard or VIP tickets – is only $100 more, and I’m sure you’ll find it a valuable experience irrespective of the price you end up paying for your ticket.</p> <p>I’ll be in San Francisco for the full week of the DevCon (from June 13-17), as there are a number of fun Meetups being planned for the week, as so many developers will be in town… and then there’s the <a href="http://www.3dwebfest.com/" target="_blank">3D Web Fest</a>, of course. Really looking forward to that!</p>
