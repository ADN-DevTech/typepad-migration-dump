<p>We’re now in the last few days before the AU2017 – and <a href="https://forge.autodesk.com/devcon-2017" target="_blank">Forge DevCon 2017</a> – CFP deadline on <strong>May 17th, 2017</strong>. <a href="http://au.autodesk.com/speaker-resource-center/call-for-proposals" target="_blank">Submit your class today</a>!</p> <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b7c8f87f69970b-pi" target="_blank"><img title="VR and AR at the Forge DevCon" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 30px auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="VR and AR at the Forge DevCon" src="/assets/image_947797.jpg" width="500" height="250"></a></p> <p>I’m particularly interested in your proposals related to Virtual, Mixed or Augmented Reality: despite not being able to attend the event, myself, I’m still running the AR/VR track. So – if you have a cool project that involves software development for AR/VR, ideally involving the Forge platform in some way – then submit your proposal with “<em>Software Development</em>” as a relevant topic and “<em>Forge DevCon</em>” as a pre-conference event. I’ll be involved in the selection process, so feel free to <a href="mailto:kean.walmsley@autodesk.com" target="_blank">drop me an email</a> with your class proposal ID so I can look out for it.</p>
