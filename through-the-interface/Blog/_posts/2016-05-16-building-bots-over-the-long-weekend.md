<p>It’s a very welcome long weekend, here in Switzerland, and as the weather’s a little brisk I decided to spend at least part of it building robots. Not the kind of robots <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2016/05/apply-for-my-dream-job-and-work-at-pier-9-in-san-francisco.html" target="_blank">you’d expect to see on Pier 9</a>, but the kind of robots sold by our friends at LEGO: two different sets I’ve received as gifts in recent months. So here’s a picture of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego_Mindstorms_EV3" target="_blank">Mindstorms</a> EV3RSTORM (Christmas) alongside <a href="http://lego.gizmodo.com/the-first-images-of-legos-upcoming-wall-e-set-are-unbel-1710898212" target="_blank">WALL•E</a> (birthday).</p> <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201bb09002387970d-pi" target="_blank"><img title="EV3RSTORM vs. WALL-E" style="float: none; margin: 30px auto; display: block" alt="EV3RSTORM vs. WALL-E" src="/assets/image_913495.jpg" width="500" height="281"></a></p> <p>Unfortunately I don’t much rate WALL•E’s chances of coming out unscathed from the above encounter: after all, who’s ever heard of the plant being mightier that the twirling blades of death?</p> <p>I’m looking forward to doing something a bit more fun with the Mindstorms EV3 set: there seem to be a lot of opportunities to do interesting things with this system, and I can see it has a lot of potential as a prototyping tool for the IoT-related projects I’m involved in. If anyone out there has some thoughts on cool EV3 projects relating to IoT, please post a comment!</p>
