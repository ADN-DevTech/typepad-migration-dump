<p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2014/06/autonomous-drone-navigation-for-autodesk-photo-on-recap-360.html" target="_blank">My Quanum Nova</a> arrived from Hong Kong, yesterday. I’d just been tracking the parcel’s progress when the doorbell rang and the postman handed it to me: he seemed surprised I didn’t mind paying the additional SFr 47 customs fee (on top of the $299 price-tag and what I had to pay for batteries) and even let him keep the change. I was in that good a mood. ;-)</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201a511e43782970c-pi" target="_blank"><img title="DSC09446" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 20px auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="DSC09446" src="/assets/image_90896.jpg" width="410" height="280" /></a></p>  <p>Reality gradually set in as I assembled the device, although that was pretty straightforward, overall. The assembly instructions were better than expected, and I was soon able to turn the device on (I’d charged all four of my 2700mAh <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_polymer_battery" target="_blank">li-poly batteries</a> in the weeks I’d been waiting for the drone to show up, so I was locked and loaded… interestingly enough, the day before the drone arrived I received a notification that <a href="http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/__1387__85__Batteries_Accessories-MultiStar.html" target="_blank">higher-capacity batteries</a> are now available, too).</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201a3fd348328970b-pi" target="_blank"><img title="DSC09452" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 20px auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="DSC09452" src="/assets/image_883519.jpg" width="410" height="280" /></a></p>  <p>Unfortunately the instructions for getting the drone’s motors to disarm were much less useable. In theory I was meant to use the left thumbstick on the controller – pushing it down to the bottom-right – to arm the motors. But try as I might I couldn’t get this to work. I wasn’t even sure whether the transmitter was working to control the drone, I really couldn’t get it to respond in any way.</p>  <p>Eventually I decided to connect it up to my PC and see if I could get anything to work using <a href="http://diydrones.com/profiles/blogs/apm-planner-2-0-rc1" target="_blank">APM Planner 2.0</a>. I was able to connect to the device – as it contains an ArduCopter-compatible board, an Arduino Mega 2560 – and could use APM Planner to adjust some options. Out of desperation – although I’d seen a few people on the forums had done this, themselves – I upgraded the ArduCopter firmware to v3.1.5.</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201a511e437aa970c-pi" target="_blank"><img title="Connecting the APM Planner 2 to my Quanum Nova" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 20px auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="Connecting the APM Planner 2 to my Quanum Nova" src="/assets/image_449880.jpg" width="400" height="287" /></a></p>  <p>This worked, but didn’t help address the connection problem. I then went and re-calibrated the radio – which allowed me to at least see that the controller was indeed connecting to the drone. This calibration did allow the motors to arm: you can imagine my surprise when this happened in my living room (yes, with the propellers attached… who thinks to remove them when there’s every chance your drone’s a dud?) and nearly got tangled up with the USB tether attaching it to my PC.</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201a3fd34833b970b-pi" target="_blank"><img title="Calibrating the radio using APM Planner 2" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 20px auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="Calibrating the radio using APM Planner 2" src="/assets/image_567615.jpg" width="400" height="258" /></a></p>  <p>Anyway, at least I knew my drone was functional, at this stage, and that I actually had to hold the right thumbstick downwards, too, for the motors to arm. The instructions could really use having this additional nugget of information provided, but hey.</p>  <p>The next thing I did was – of course – head outside and try an actual flight. First, though, I attached my GoPro-equivalent camera, my CamOne Infinity, to the bottom of the Nova with the provided mount. As far as I’m aware, <a href="http://recap360.autodesk.com" target="_blank">Photo on ReCap 360</a> won’t work with stills coming from the Infinity, but this was more to capture the event than to provide data for a 3D reconstruction.</p>  <p>I’m glad I did: the results were hilarious. The drone took off fairly steadily, but I then made the rookie move of switching to what I thought was a stabilized flying mode but ended up sending the drone skywards at high speed. I panicked, tried to adjust and brought the drone back down to earth with a thump. This dislodged the camera, which stayed in the grass filming the departure of the drone as it now – with much less weight – looped back up into the air and crashed elsewhere in the garden.</p>  <p>Here’s the video of the event – I’ve blurred the faces to protect the privacy of a family member, which I’m actually glad has also obscured the look on my face as most of this was playing out.</p>  <br /><iframe height="264" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/IHICTrLuHIE?rel=0" frameborder="0" width="470" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>  <br />  <br />  <p>The drone is, incredibly, largely intact. The upper side of two of the arms have cracked – as has the GPS tower on top – but nothing that can’t be held together with tape. I can’t help feeling that – despite any sense of personal ineptness – this is a fairly typical experience for first-time drone pilots. For me, though, it underscores two things: 1) I did well to start off with a $300 drone and 2) I really need to get to the point where software is taking care of an increasing amount of the navigation effort. If I’d wanted to be a pilot I would have chosen another career, after all. :-)</p>  <p>I’m heading off to Greece on Sunday for a couple of weeks, so it’ll be some time before I blog again. I’ll hopefully be able to <a href="http://twitter.com/keanw" target="_blank">tweet</a> once or twice from the beach, but I’m planning to make this a proper break to be with the family. When I get back I’m hoping to spend a bit more time with the Nova, and perhaps even to start working with the new <a href="https://store.3drobotics.com/products/3dr-rtf-x8-2014" target="_blank">3DR X8</a> that our office has just bought, too, which should work really well with the new “one button 3D capture” DroidPlanner functionality.</p>
