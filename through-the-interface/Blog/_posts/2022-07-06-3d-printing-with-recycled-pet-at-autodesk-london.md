<p>I’m in London for a few days this week for some internal meetings and a customer visit.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202a2eecb866f200d-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="At Autodesk in Covent Garden" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_935843.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="At Autodesk in Covent Garden" width="500" /></a></p><p>While visiting the Soho office I checked in with my Autodesk Research colleague Allin Groom about a project he and Matt Oosthuizen have undertaken to help reduce the impact of waste in the office.</p><p>The inspiration for the project was an all too common problem: a lot of waste generated by employees – many of whom buy takeaway lunches at local shops and restaurants – comes in the form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyethylene_terephthalate" target="_blank">polyethylene terephthalate (PET)</a> containers. While this material is nominally recyclable, Allin and Matt were motivated to see how PET might be repurposed locally in the office as a material for 3D printing.</p><p>Allin gave George – another colleague visiting the office – and I an informal tour of the office’s makerspace along with an introduction to this fascinating project.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202a30d42d53d200b-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="Some of the current 3D printers" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_350642.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="Some of the current 3D printers" width="500" /></a></p><p>One of the early stages is to clean the bottles – removing caps, labels and glue – ready for shredding. It’s worth noting that a lot of the usual concerns about using food and drink containers for secondary manufacturing relate to their suitability for injection molding: additive manufacturing with extruded filament suffers a lot less from this issue.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202a308d56fe5200c-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="Some PET bottles waiting to be shredded" border="0" height="500" src="/assets/image_255024.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="Some PET bottles waiting to be shredded" width="375" /></a></p><p>Here’s a close-up of some bottles that have been prepared for repurposing.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202a2eecb766c200d-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="PETs in the office" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_228155.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="PETs in the office" width="500" /></a></p><p>The next step is to flatten and shred the cleaned bottles. This is performed using a standard $100 document shredder with the plastic guard removed!</p><p>I don’t have a picture of the shredded material – the process to turn it to granules was done fairly recently, so there wasn’t any waiting for further processing – but it probably looks much like we’d expect.</p><p><p>The system to convert the shredded plastic to filament starts with The Granulator.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202a30d42d54b200b-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="The current setup for filament creation" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_417561.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="The current setup for filament creation" width="500" /></a></p><p>Yes, this creates granules.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202a2eecb7559200d-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="The Granulator" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_474600.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="The Granulator" width="500" /></a></p><p>This first cut of granules are run through a following dehydration machine that removes any residual moisture.<br /></p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202a2eecba880200d-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="First cut granules" border="0" height="500" src="/assets/image_461161.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="First cut granules" width="375" /></a></p><p>Here’s a close-up of these initial granules.<br /></p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202a2eecb7735200d-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="Shredded PET" border="0" height="500" src="/assets/image_294116.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="Shredded PET" width="375" /></a></p><p>The filament extruded from the melted granules can have varying hues – while being basically transparent – but the quality looks very good.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202a30d42d560200b-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="Filament" border="0" height="500" src="/assets/image_155602.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="Filament" width="375" /></a></p><p>Here’s Allin with granules, filament and the result of a test print.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202a30d42d82f200b-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="Allin talking" border="0" height="500" src="/assets/image_7145.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="Allin talking" width="375" /></a></p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202a2eecb7577200d-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="Granules, filament and printed output" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_223710.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="Granules, filament and printed output" width="500" /></a></p><p>This is a star that the team 3D-printed for the Autodesk London Christmas tree.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202a2eecb757f200d-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="Printed Xmas tree star" border="0" height="500" src="/assets/image_222775.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="Printed Xmas tree star" width="375" /></a></p><p>Now for the <strong>really</strong> cool bit. And yes, I know all of this has been pretty cool up to this point.<br /></p><p>Allin and Matt are exploring the possibility for recycling this material multiple times, something that we’re not aware of anyone else attempting. They have taken the printed output from the process and have reshredded and reused it to create more granules.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202a2eecb756f200d-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="Bag of reground granules" border="0" height="500" src="/assets/image_235406.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="Bag of reground granules" width="375" /></a></p><p>They plan on repeating this multiple times, to test how far the process can be taken in terms of iterations.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202a308d5a115200c-pi" target="_blank"><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202a2eecb7573200d-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="Regrind #2" border="0" height="500" src="/assets/image_206015.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="Regrind #2" width="375" /></a></a></p><p>Some interesting additional points: there are power metres throughout the makerspace, so the team has exact data on the energy required throughout this process, allowing them to properly understand the carbon cost of recycling in this way. The results of this are going to be extremely interesting.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202a2eecba883200d-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="Matt driving a multi-material print" border="0" height="500" src="/assets/image_875463.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="Matt driving a multi-material print" width="375" /></a></p><p>Finally, Allin and Matt would love to see this approach developed further by others. If you’re interested in learning more – or collaborating in some way – please do reach out.</p></p>
