<p>I’ve long been fascinated by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereoscopy">stereoscopy</a>, as I suspect is the case for most people lucky enough to have two functioning eyes. There’s something magical about a device that immerses us in a three dimensional scene by hijacking that fundamental input mechanism of ours, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binocular_vision">binocular vision</a>. I almost always get that “oh wow” feeling: it just never gets old.</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201bb07b3a70a970d-pi" target="_blank"><img title="View-Master" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 20px auto; border-left: 0px; display: block; padding-right: 0px" border="0" alt="View-Master" src="/assets/image_109657.jpg" width="304" height="203" /></a></p>  <p>I also happen to like collecting cool bits of vintage technology, although in an admittedly haphazard and opportunistic way: I have printing blocks, a typewriter, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TI-57">TI-57</a> programmable calculator, an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton_(platform)">Apple Newton</a>, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_(PDA)">Palm Pilot</a> and an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPAQ">iPAQ</a>, to name a few objects that are cluttering my office.</p>  <p>Some time ago I decided to start collecting <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/View-Master">View-Masters</a> – the devices and their reels – but I didn’t get very far. Like 90% of my interests this particular one stayed in the “interesting but no need to go further, for now” phase. But as VR has finally reached the masses – particularly with <a href="https://cardboard.withgoogle.com">Google Cardboard</a> and <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/11/04/oculus-ceo-says-consumer-oculus-rift-vr-headset-is-months-not-years-away">the upcoming consumer-oriented version of Occulus Rift</a>, but there are other <a href="http://www.poppy3d.com">really interesting things</a> happening out there – the whole View-Master itch has started up again.</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b7c70e6a5a970b-pi" target="_blank"><img title="Model B" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 20px auto; border-left: 0px; display: block; padding-right: 0px" border="0" alt="Model B" src="/assets/image_689477.jpg" width="199" height="264" /></a>Over the last couple of weeks I’ve gone a little nuts on eBay, picking up Model <a href="http://www.viewmaster.co.uk/htm/a.asp">A</a>, <a href="http://www.viewmaster.co.uk/htm/b.asp">B</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.viewmaster.co.uk/htm/c.asp">C</a> View-Masters (I’m most interested by models from the 1940s &amp; ’50s) and lots of classic reels. The first few auctions were a bit brutal: the interesting auctions finished in the afternoon, Pacific time, so I had to set my alarm for 2:30am to be able to place bids in the closing seconds. (I’ve since started using <a href="https://www.myibidder.com">an app</a> that can “snipe” eBay auctions without you being online, which seems to work very well and lets me sleep a little more.)</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b8d0983299970c-pi" target="_blank"><img title="Model Cs with box" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 20px auto; border-left: 0px; display: block; padding-right: 0px" border="0" alt="Model Cs with box" src="/assets/image_667350.jpg" width="304" height="229" /></a></p>  <p>What I find especially interesting about old-school <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereoscope">stereoscopes</a> like the View-Master is that a number of application areas that were relevant, back in the day, are now re-emerging for VR. For sure View-Masters were used as an inexpensive way to experience the world – without the need for travel – but they were also used to teach doctors anatomy and – during WWII – to help soldiers develop their skills for identifying ships and aircraft as well as for range estimation.</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201bb07b3a6f7970d-pi" target="_blank"><img title="WWII study reel" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 20px auto; border-left: 0px; display: block; padding-right: 0px" border="0" alt="WWII study reel" src="/assets/image_574353.jpg" width="200" height="181" /></a></p>  <p>For sure VR is reaching into similar areas beyond entertainment – both medical and military – but clearly the ability to synthesize 3D and then use stereoscopy to deliver it immersively is taking things much further, this time around. I expect it to be really compelling for the design industry, too, as do others here at Autodesk. For instance, check out Jim Quanci’s testimonial on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dodocase/diy-virtual-reality-open-source-future">this “heading for stretch goals” Kickstarter project</a> to really help DIY VR go to the next level.</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201bb07b3a7af970d-pi" target="_blank"><img title="DIYVR" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 20px auto; border-left: 0px; display: block; padding-right: 0px" border="0" alt="DIYVR" src="/assets/image_534638.jpg" width="304" height="202" /></a></p>  <p>Anyway, I’ll be picking up a number of my “new” View-Masters when in Las Vegas: if you happen to be coming along to <a href="https://events.au.autodesk.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=8417">Cyrille Fauvel’s class at which I’ll be co-speaking</a>, I’ll bring a number of them along to that. The class is all about stereoscopy, after all. :-) (At some point I’d love to try turning an old View-Master into a real VR viewer, something along the lines of <a href="http://hackaday.com/2013/11/13/view-master-video-player/">this awesome 3D media viewer hack</a>.)</p>  <p>Back to the subject of Google Cardboard… in parallel with <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2014/10/gearing-up-for-the-vr-hackathon.html">the</a> <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2014/10/creating-a-stereoscopic-viewer-for-google-cardboard-using-the-autodesk-360-viewer-part-1.html">fun</a> <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2014/10/creating-a-stereoscopic-viewer-for-google-cardboard-using-the-autodesk-360-viewer-part-2.html">that’s</a> <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2014/10/creating-a-stereoscopic-viewer-for-google-cardboard-using-the-autodesk-360-viewer-part-3.html">been</a> <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2014/10/vr-hackathon-2014-in-sf.html">happening</a> <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2014/10/adding-speech-recognition-to-our-stereoscopic-google-cardboard-viewer.html">with</a> <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2014/11/adding-more-speech-recognition-to-our-stereoscopic-google-cardboard-viewer.html">A360</a>, a number of noteworthy Cardboard apps have been popping up. Let’s take a look at some of the apps you can play around with to get a feel for this platform’s capabilities… (I’ve been using Android for this, by the way: you’ll find that not all the below apps are available for other devices.)</p>  <p>When you get your hands on a Cardboard kit – such as the <a href="http://www.dodocase.com/products/google-cardboard-vr-goggle-toolkit">DODOcase VR Cardboard Toolkits</a> being given out at <a href="http://autodeskdevdays.com/devdays-2014">DevDays</a> – you should head on over to <a href="http://vr.chromeexperiments.com">Chrome Experiments for Cardboard</a> – which really showcases the power of WebGL for creating VR apps – and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.samples.apps.cardboarddemo">the Google Cardboard demo app</a>. There’s lots of fun stuff to be found there, such as Google Earth in 3D:</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201bb07b39e8f970d-pi" target="_blank"><img title="Google Earth" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 20px auto; border-left: 0px; display: block; padding-right: 0px" border="0" alt="Google Earth" src="/assets/image_776451.jpg" width="394" height="238" /></a></p>  <p>I’ve just started playing with <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.mobius.vrcinema">VR Cinema</a>, which seems fun. It allows you to play videos in a number of formats via Cardboard… it can’t retrofit 3D to 2D videos, of course, but even displaying your 2D home movies via the device is quite cool:</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b7c70e63b0970b-pi" target="_blank"><img title="VR Cinema" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 20px auto; border-left: 0px; display: block; padding-right: 0px" border="0" alt="VR Cinema" src="/assets/image_266855.jpg" width="394" height="238" /></a></p>  <p>Movies that encode 3D information will be even more interesting to watch using this app, presumably.</p>  <p>Perhaps the most View-Master-like of the apps I’ve seen – in spirit, at least – is <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.VRCraftworks.Orbulus&amp;hl=en">Orbulus</a>, which allows you to view any of a large number of <a href="http://www.androidcentral.com/photo-sphere">photo spheres</a> that have been captured and shared by people. There’s a slight camera offset between the views for the two eyes, but I don’t believe two separate spheres have been captured: the 3D effect isn’t that strong. It’s still a nice way to view spherical panoramas, though.</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b8d0982ff4970c-pi" target="_blank"><img title="Orbulus" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 20px auto; border-left: 0px; display: block; padding-right: 0px" border="0" alt="Orbulus" src="/assets/image_122010.jpg" width="394" height="238" /></a></p>  <p>Now onto some more three-dimensional experiences delivered via Cardboard…</p>  <p><a href="http://www.jauntvr.com/#about">Jaunt</a> have created <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2014/11/20/google-cardboard-app-paul-mccartney/">a really cool Cardboard app</a> allowing you to take the stage with Paul McCartney for a rendition of “Live and Let Die”. This one was captured using multiple cameras and gives a much more 3D experience. Well worth trying.</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201bb07b39ea0970d-pi" target="_blank"><img title="Paul McCartney&#39;s VR concert" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 20px auto; border-left: 0px; display: block; padding-right: 0px" border="0" alt="Paul McCartney&#39;s VR concert" src="/assets/image_863693.jpg" width="394" height="238" /></a></p>  <p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Refugio3D.SpaceStation">Refugio 3D Space Station</a> is an immersive VR environment – you start on a space station and can walk through teleportation portals to various worlds – which is very impressive. They also seem to have their own <a href="http://www.refugio3d.net">Cardboard-like hardware platform</a>. (Thanks to Ugo de Maio for bringing this one to my attention!)</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201bb07b39ea9970d-pi" target="_blank"><img title="Refugio 3D Space Station" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 20px auto; border-left: 0px; display: block; padding-right: 0px" border="0" alt="Refugio 3D Space Station" src="/assets/image_312894.jpg" width="394" height="238" /></a></p>  <p>Finally, <a href="http://www.volvocars.com/us/about/our-stories/google-cardboard">Volvo</a> have launched their<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.volvo.volvoreality"> Volvo Reality</a> Cardboard app allowing people to experience the new XC90. You need to be in North America to install this one, though, so I haven’t actually tried it myself.</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201bb07b39eb7970d-pi" target="_blank"><img title="Volvo Cardboard" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 20px auto; border-left: 0px; display: block; padding-right: 0px" border="0" alt="Volvo Cardboard" src="/assets/image_989950.jpg" width="260" height="260" /></a></p>  <p>New apps are popping up, every day.
