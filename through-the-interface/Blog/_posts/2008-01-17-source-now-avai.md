<p>A quick post, for now, just to point you to this blog:</p>

<p><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/sburke/archive/2008/01/16/configuring-visual-studio-to-debug-net-framework-source-code.aspx">http://blogs.msdn.com/sburke/archive/2008/01/16/configuring-visual-studio-to-debug-net-framework-source-code.aspx</a></p>

<p>This will only work with Visual Studio 2008, it seems, so I haven't yet tested this out myself (I tend to be a laggard when it comes to Visual Studio, for some reason).</p>

<p>A quick note on what I've been up to in my spare time: I'm currently diving deeply into F#, to prepare for some internal presentations I'll be giving in February. As part of the exercise I went up to the attic and dusted off the 3.5&quot; floppies containing my old final year project from my Computer Science studies, which uses a functional programming language called Miranda to model the behaviour of a Motorola 6800 processor. I've managed to convert this to F#, and am now seeing if I can get it to show some results.</p>

<p>I'll be back posting&nbsp; more regularly next week, I hope.</p>
