<p>We’re edging closer to the end of this series (which will come at episode 64, appropriately enough). There’s still plenty of fun to be had before it’s over, though!</p>
<p>In <a href="https://youtu.be/cV1CN3nfL2I" rel="noopener" target="_blank">this week’s episode</a> we once again play games found on a series of random floppies. We start with a game I actually enjoyed a lot called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Arc_of_Yesod" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Arc of Yesod</a>. The main character comes with a remote drone – how cool is that? We then loaded a German strategy game called <a href="http://www.c64.cz/index.php?detailhry=8537" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The World</a>, but not for very long. Afterwards came <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kane_(video_game)" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Kane</a>, <a href="https://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=958" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Forester</a> and <a href="http://pirates.emucamp.com/a/h/hiskado/c64/main.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Hi Ska Do</a>. These seem to have come from the long tail of Commodore 64 games, but hey – it’s once again a week like that.</p>
<p>Here’s the video:</p>
