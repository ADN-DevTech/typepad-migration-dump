<p>Well, happy birthday to “Through the Interface”, anyway. :-)</p>  <p>3 years, 394 posts and 2,559 comments later, TTIF is still going strong. In fact, it’s now the 2nd most visited Autodesk blog, after <a href="http://autodesk.blogs.com/between_the_lines/">Shaan’s</a> (some of our blogs with shorter posts publish their full content via RSS, so this doesn’t necessarily completely reflect the relative readership, but hey).</p>  <p>Here’s a graph of the page hits over the last three years… I think the number on the Y-axis reflects the total page hits in a monthly window (at least that’s what seems to make sense). [I’m not too worried about the way the graph tails off to the right – that just seems to be the way our analysis tool works.]</p>  <p><img style="border-right-width: 0px; margin: 20px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" title="TTIF - 3 years of page hits" border="0" alt="TTIF - 3 years of page hits" src="/assets/image_163354.jpg" width="444" height="212" /> </p>  <p>I’ve personally gained a great deal from my blogging experience over the last three years – your questions and the need to post regularly have driven my personal learning and have led me to having a lot of fun. Long may it continue! :-)</p>  <p>Thanks for all your support, keep your ideas and suggestions flowing, and please keep on helping us to make our products the best development platforms we can.</p>
