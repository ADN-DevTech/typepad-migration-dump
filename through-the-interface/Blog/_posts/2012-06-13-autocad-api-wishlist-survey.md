<p>Hot on the heels of <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2012/06/api-wishlist-surveys.html" target="_blank">my last post regarding this year’s API wishlist surveys</a>, Stephen Preston has <a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/autocad/2012/06/autocad-api-wishlist-survey-2012.html" target="_blank">announced on the AutoCAD DevBlog</a> the launch of this year’s <a href="http://www.zoomerang.com/Survey/WEB22FYFDDAZ88" target="_blank">AutoCAD API wishlist survey</a>.</p>  <p>The survey will remain open until <strong>June 22nd</strong>, but don’t delay – you’ll find it very quick to complete. This year’s survey has a somewhat different format: it has a number of questions dedicated to understanding your needs around AutoCAD WS and developing for the cloud. This doesn’t mean we’re no longer interested in the desktop – nothing could be further from the truth – so be sure to use the survey to let us know your requirements for full AutoCAD, too.</p>
