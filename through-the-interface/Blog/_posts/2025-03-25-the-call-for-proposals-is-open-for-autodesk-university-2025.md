<p>The countdown is officially on for <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/autodesk-university/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">AU 2025</a>, which is being held in Nashville, Tennessee, from September 16-18.</p>

<p>Things kicked off properly on Thursday with the CFP opening. It’ll be possible to <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/autodesk-university/conference/call-for-proposals" rel="noopener" target="_blank">submit your class proposal</a> from now until April 17.</p>

<p>The big news for this year’s event is that there will be a new class length available to folks: in addition to a 50+10 (talk+Q&amp;A, in minutes) session there will be the option of <strong>20+10</strong>, also.</p>
<p>It will also only be possible to submit a maximum of <strong>3 proposals per person</strong>. This might not sound like a big change, but it will be a change for some: it’s sometimes hard to know the important selection criteria when submitting to a conference, so diversity can be your friend.</p>
<p>The good news on that front is that the AU team has been clear in the CFP guide that submitting classes with these areas of focus will increase your chances:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The transformative potential of <strong>AI</strong>. This encompasses practical uses such as AI-driven design, predictive analytics, automation, and smart practices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Climate Resilience</strong>, including preparing, adapting and enhancing the resilience of infrastructure and communities in the face of climate change.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The integration and application of <strong>Digital Twin </strong>technology in construction and urban planning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Connected Data and Workflow </strong>and harnessing the power of big data and digital technologies to drive innovation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Discuss the use of Extended Reality (<strong>XR</strong>) technologies, including virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and mixed reality (MR).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I anticipate submitting something relating to Digital Twins and/or XR, but we’ll see. I very much hope to be at this year’s AU - which would be my first time in Nashville, apart from anything else - but we’ll see how things pan out.</p>
