<p>It’s come around quickly, I know. At the <strong>end of next week</strong> the <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2021/03/autodesk-university-2021-call-for-proposals-opens-on-march-30th.html" target="_blank">CFP closes for Autodesk University 2021</a> – it’s really <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/autodesk-university/conference/call-for-proposals" target="_blank">time to submit</a>!</p><p>This year’s AU is being held a touch earlier than usual: I don’t believe the specific dates have been shared, as yet, but given the timing of this year’s CFP I’d expect it to be a month or so earlier than last year.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20263e99fd5a4200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="333" title="Greg Fallon at AU 2020" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Greg Fallon at AU 2020" src="/assets/image_728218.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>I’ll be putting the finishing touches on my own class proposal over the coming days, and will share it early next week. This quick post is really just a quick reminder to people who (like me) have delayed putting pen to paper and might otherwise be in danger of missing the window.</p><p>Once you do submit your class, be sure to let your networks know about the <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/autodesk-university/conference/call-for-proposals/voting" target="_blank">voting system</a> (you should provide them a direct link to your class proposal, of course): this will remain open until <strong>May 12th</strong>, and gives the AU team valuable information about the community’s interest in particular topics.</p>
