<p>Some quick updates to round off the week…</p> <p>Firstly, a couple of “calls for proposals” have just gone out.</p> <p><a href="http://au.autodesk.com" target="_blank">Autodesk University 2016</a> is once again being held in Las Vegas, but this year it’ll be earlier than usual: rather than being held right after Thanksgiving, it’s now the week before, from November 15-17, 2016. This is going to be a welcome change for all US-based presenters, in that they can deliver their classes at AU and then take a well-deserved Thanksgiving break rather than spending it making last-minute changes to their slide decks and demos. If you’re interested in presenting at this year’s event, you can <a href="http://au.autodesk.com/speaker-resource-center/call-for-proposals" target="_blank">submit your class proposals before May 27</a>. I’m expecting to present on a couple of topics, this year, most probably VR and IoT. Watch this space for the specifics.</p> <p>The next Forge Accelerator in SF is being held the week after the <a href="http://forge.autodesk.com/conference" target="_blank">Forge DevCon</a>, which is great for people who want to attend both the DevCon and the Accelerator. If you’re interested in participating, <a href="http://autodeskcloudaccelerator.com/apply" target="_blank">submit your application proposal here</a> (you can find additional details on the <a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/cloud_and_mobile/2016/04/forge-accelerator-call-for-proposals.html" target="_blank">Cloud &amp; Mobile DevBlog</a>). May the Forge be with you for two whole weeks!</p> <p>Secondly, after having visited <a href="https://www.ethz.ch/en.html" target="_blank">ETH Zurich</a> a couple of times already this year, I’ve just spent the best part of today on the campus of its sister university: <a href="https://www.epfl.ch/" target="_blank">EPFL</a>. On arriving at EPFL, the first order of business was to have a coffee in the impressive <a href="http://rolexlearningcenter.epfl.ch/" target="_blank">Rolex Building</a>:</p> <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b7c84da93d970b-pi"><img title="Inside the Rolex Building at EPFL" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 30px auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="Inside the Rolex Building at EPFL" src="/assets/image_29925.jpg" width="504" height="285"></a></p> <p>Wandering through the campus, I also noticed some street art by Leon Keer. (I couldn’t take the picture from the “sweet spot” as it was fenced off for some construction work.)</p> <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b8d1d79cfa970c-pi"><img title="A Leon Keer at EPFL" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 30px auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="A Leon Keer at EPFL" src="/assets/image_355713.jpg" width="504" height="285"></a></p> <p>Some of you may remember that <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2012/07/enjoyed-england.html" target="_blank">I met Leon in the UK back in 2012</a>, and was inspired by his work to <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2012/08/creating-3d-street-art-using-autocad.html" target="_blank">see whether AutoCAD could be used to do something similar</a>.</p> <p>My main purpose for being at EPFL was to meet with Bogdan Lazar and his colleagues at <a href="https://www.f6s.com/skeletoncad" target="_blank">SkeletonCAD</a>. Bogdan had come along to <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2016/03/my-swiss-tech-talk-at-autodesk.html" target="_blank">my recent Tech Talk in the Neuchatel office</a>, and had suggested meeting with the SkeletonCAD team in Lausanne. It’s a really interesting project: rather than using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_representation" target="_blank">boundary representations</a> it’s based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medial_axis" target="_blank">medial axis</a> modeling, which apparently has advantages when running simulations and performing topological analyses. I’m looking forward to seeing where it goes.</p> <p>Talking about my Swiss Tech Talk, here’s a quick 360-degree video I just received from the organisers. For best results <a href="https://youtu.be/0Iac43NAZCQ" target="_blank">load this link on your smartphone</a> (it’s even better with Google Cardboard). Feel free to enjoy the music, but please don’t listen too carefully to what I’m saying. You’re much better off hearing it <a href="https://youtu.be/3VI2iX5VW4s" target="_blank">directly from Jeff Kowalski</a>.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p align="center"><iframe height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0Iac43NAZCQ?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" width="500" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
