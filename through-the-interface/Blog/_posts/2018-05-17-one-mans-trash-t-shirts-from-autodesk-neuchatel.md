<p>Here’s some fun memorabilia from Autodesk’s Neuchatel office: T-shirts from a couple of different events held in recent years. Both are brand-new and have never been worn.</p><p>The first comes from an internal event that was held back in 2015 to highlight the importance of taking security (particularly product and information security) seriously. The T-shirt is red and of size XXL:</p><p align="center"><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20224df337f60200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="333" title="Reboot event" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Reboot event" src="/assets/image_497150.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>The second comes from the first Design Night Switzerland held at the end of 2016. The theme for this event was robotics, so there’s a picture of a robot on the back. the T-shirt is white and of size XL:</p><p align="center"><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20224e03a6f3d200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="333" title="Design Night Switzerland" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Design Night Switzerland" src="/assets/image_152473.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>If you <a href="mailto:kean.walmsley@autodesk.com?subject=I want a free T-shirt" target="_blank">send me an email</a> claiming one or both of these lovely garments – with your postal address, of course – then I’ll send it/them to you. Please be aware that you will be on the hook for sending me a picture of you wearing it/them, so that I can update the post to show where they’ve ended up.</p><p><strong><em>Update:</em></strong></p><p>The red T-shirt has now been claimed by Sven Amiet. <strike>The white one is still up-for-grabs…</strike></p><p>The white T-short has also now been claimed, this time by Casey Jung-Fagan.</p><p>Photos to come! </p>
