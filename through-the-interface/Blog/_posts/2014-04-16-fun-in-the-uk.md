<p>It’s been a great week of holidays, so far. There’s been a lot of driving: we booked our flights in and out of Stansted – as our main purpose was to attend a good friend’s wedding in Suffolk – but fairly late on we decided to drive up to Cumbria to visit my grandmother.</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201a73dabd5e2970d-pi" target="_blank"><img title="Best fish and chips in ages" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 20px auto; border-left: 0px; display: block; padding-right: 0px" border="0" alt="Best fish and chips in ages" src="/assets/image_126656.jpg" width="470" height="357" /></a></p>  <p><em>My birthday dinner at </em><a href="http://www.windmillinn-redmile.co.uk/" target="_blank"><em>The Windmill Inn</em></a><em> in Redmile – a pub used to film certain episodes of the classic UK series, </em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auf_Wiedersehen_Pet" target="_blank"><em>Auf Wiedersehen Pet</em></a><em>.</em></p>  <p>As my old friend Charles McAuley used to say, the difference between England and America is that in England 100 miles is a long way and in America 100 years is a long time. So the 4-5 hour drive up north was pretty tiring, but at least we really got lucky with the accommodation – the <a href="http://www.oakwoodparkhotel.co.uk/" target="_blank">Oakwood Park Hotel</a> in Brampton was incredible.</p>  <p>The weather was also a little fresh for the start of our week, mainly due to the biting wind. But we got to stand on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadrian%27s_Wall" target="_blank">Hadrian’s Wall</a>, visiting <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banna_(Birdoswald)" target="_blank">Birdoswald</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lanercost_Priory" target="_blank">Lanercost Priory</a> and refuelling with lots of cups of tea in various teashops.</p>  <p>We drove back down south on Monday, staying over (once again lucking out) at <a href="http://peacock-farm.co.uk/" target="_blank">Peacock Farm</a> in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redmile" target="_blank">Redmile</a> before we drove through to Suffolk. We stopped off briefly in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downham_Market" target="_blank">the town where I grew up</a> – mainly to show the kids how lucky they are to live in Switzerland – and then visited <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grimes_Graves" target="_blank">Grimes Graves</a>, as they all have a thing about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flint" target="_blank">flint</a> (and this is very much flint country).</p>  <p>Today is the wedding day, so I’m starting to think about getting suited and booted. I’m really looking forward to catching up with some of my oldest and dearest friends (some of whom have travelled across from New Zealand and Kuala Lumpur to be here).</p>  <p>Also the sun has come out, so it’s warming up a little, thankfully. And when the sun is shining in the UK, it’s really a wonderful place to be. :-)</p>
