<p>At our in-person Autodesk University events, it’s common for our R&amp;D teams to interview customers and to brief them on ongoing research projects and upcoming product features. This is a really valuable part of our R&amp;D process: this feedback helps us make sure that our products and services help the industry move forward by addressing real customer pain.</p>
<p>This year is a bit different, of course: rather than hanging around the Idea Exchange – which I know many of us struggle to find time for – you can sign up for sessions via the <a href="http://au.autodesk.com" target="_blank">AU website</a> (or the links in this post below). Our User Research teams will then do their best to schedule a Zoom session at a time that’s convenient to you to run you through some forward-looking concepts and gather your feedback on these visions of the future.</p>
<p>Here are four sessions being run by Autodesk Research (the first two by my direct team, Research Engineering). Please note that for all these sessions availability will be based on the space in session and also your fit with the study.</p>
<blockquote>
<h2>Building Trust between Structural Designers and AI-assistants</h2>
<p><em>For Structural Engineers, Architects, and MEP Engineers (duration 60 minutes)</em></p>
<p>In AEC, generative design and AI have the power to supercharge the workflow of Structural Engineers by assisting in the broader exploration of structural design solutions within shorter timeframes. However, in a field where making the right, informed decision is often life critical, generative design cannot be a black box. Help Autodesk Research explore how to reveal your AI-assistant’s thought process to build trust and create the transparency you need to make the right decisions for your generatively created structural design solutions. In this session we’ll be gathering your feedback on several approaches to creating more clarity, transparency and evidence to support how and why a generatively designed structural solution came to be.</p>

<h2>What is the future of Structural Design in the AEC industry?</h2>
<p><em>For Structural Engineers, Architects, and MEP Engineers (duration 30 minutes)</em></p>
<p>You’re a Structural Engineer, we know you have a strong opinion - what is the future of Structural Design in the AEC industry? And what do you want it to be? In this short interview session, you’ll be helping Autodesk Research see the industry through your eyes. Where should we be focusing? What can we do to help you move your practice into the future?</p>

<h2>AI-assisted design of concrete structures for design-build contractors</h2>
<p><em>For contractors who design &amp; build concrete structures (duration 90 minutes)</em></p>
<p>Join this research project if you are a self-performing contractor who needs an AI-assisted technology for designing concrete structures. Unlike conventional tools, this future technology not only brings your knowledge of construction into the design of structures but also incorporates various execution strategies (e.g., buying vs. leasing formwork) into the design. Come and shape this future AI-assisted tool with us!</p>

<h2>Organize Design Knowledge - Create an online knowledgebase for products</h2>
<p><em>For designers and developers of hardware or electronics products (duration 60 minutes)</em></p>
<p>Product teardown is a common activity among product teams to discover new ideas and study the latest technology. If you are a Mechanical Engineer, Industrial Designer, or Manufacturer, please join us in this Autodesk Research workshop, where we will explore new ways to bring this offline experience online, and extend the concept of a team to a bigger open community. Together we will create a knowledge base for the state-of-the-art products, and ask questions like: how do we augment and share knowledge? How can AI (artificial intelligence) help us in design?</p>

<p>If you don’t feel like having a scheduled session with Researchers – but still want to help influence the future of the industry – then this research survey might be more your thing. It covers these main areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Future of Work</li>
<li>The Future of Automation</li>
<li>Pre-Design (in Design &amp; Manufacturing)</li>
<li>Sustainability (in Design &amp; Manufacturing )</li>
<li>Process Digital Twins (in Design and Manufacturing)</li>
</ul>
<p>Interested in any of these topics? Then please participate in the below survey.</p>
<blockquote>
<h2>Help Autodesk Research Image the Future of the AEC and Manufacturing Industries</h2>
<p><em>For anyone</em></p>
<p>Autodesk Research imagines customer work 5-10 years into the future and leverages emerging technology to supercharge workflows, eliminate pain points, and introduce completely new paradigms for design and make. Help us to understand how you work today as well as what your expectations and visions for the future might be.</p>
