I’ve just gone ahead and registered: I’ll arrive in Las Vegas on Saturday November 10th (to give myself a fighting chance of handling my jetlag before things kick off properly on Monday the 12th) and head home on the Thursday evening.</p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad3a82d05200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="250" title="Forge City in the AU 2017 Exhibit Hall" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Forge City in the AU 2017 Exhibit Hall" src="/assets/image_301112.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>My classes, this year, fall <a href="https://autodeskuniversity.smarteventscloud.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=226503" target="_blank">during the pre-conference</a> and the <a href="https://autodeskuniversity.smarteventscloud.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=229074" target="_blank">first day of AU proper</a>, which is nice, especially as it means you won’t need a full AU pass to attend (<a href="https://forge.autodesk.com/devcon-2018#tickets" target="_blank">you can find pricing of Monday passes and Monday + Tuesday passes here</a>). You can details about the classes on the <a href="https://autodeskuniversity.smarteventscloud.com/connect/search.ww?searchPhrase=#loadSearch-searchPhrase=Kean&amp;searchType=session&amp;tc=0&amp;sortBy=relevance&amp;i(41005)=&amp;i(57245)=&amp;p=" target="_blank">AU site</a>. My pre-conference session is actually part of “Connect &amp; Construct”, but as this is being organised in conjunction with the Forge DevCon, a ticket for the DevCon will also let you attend this session, too.<a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad388726a200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="250" title="Baby robot" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Baby robot" src="/assets/image_888170.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>There are a lot of other great classes scheduled, this year: I know this as I’ve been helping curate content for the “complementary technologies” track of this year’s DevCon. <a href="https://autodeskuniversity.smarteventscloud.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=227482" target="_blank">One of the classes I helped select</a> – and one that looks really interesting – is by Lauren Vasey, a research associate at the University of Stuttgart’s Institute for Computational Design and Construction (ICD). Lauren’s project has <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/redshift/construction-robot/" target="_blank">just been featured on Redshift</a>, which is very cool: they’re working to rethink how construction of the future might combine technologies such as Augmented Reality, IoT, generative design and robotic fabrication. And they’re leveraging <a href="http://forge.autodesk.com" target="_blank">Forge</a> to do so. Great stuff!</p>
