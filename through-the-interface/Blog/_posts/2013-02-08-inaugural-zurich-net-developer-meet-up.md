<p>I headed cross to the Zurich area on Tuesday afternoon – which is quite a trek from where I live, around ~2.5 hours by train – to attend the first <a href="http://zurichdev.net" target="_blank">Zurich .NET Developer meet-up</a>. The event was held in <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/switzerland/microsoft-schweiz/de/kontakt/lageplan/wallisellen.mspx" target="_blank">the Microsoft office in Wallisellen</a>: they kindly provided beer and the meeting room, while the session itself was organised by members of the local .NET community. Considering the weather – <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/npetit/8452065061" target="_blank">a pretty serious snowstorm</a> hit the country that day – the event was surprisingly well attended.</p>
<p>The main topic of the session was <a href="http://www.galasoft.ch/mvvm" target="_blank">MVVM Light</a>, a lightweight framework developed by <a href="http://twitter.com/lbugnion" target="_blank">Laurent Bugnion</a> that makes it easier to implement the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_View_ViewModel" target="_blank">Model View ViewModel</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architectural_pattern" target="_blank">architectural pattern</a>. Laurent spent some time introducing Windows 8 development and then went on to talk about how MVVM Light can be used to develop for both Windows 8 and prior releases of the OS (and Windows Phone, for that matter):</p>

<p>It was an interesting session: I’d made use of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller" target="_blank">MVC</a> before, but not MVVM. I admittedly tend not to do very much with UI frameworks – I dabble with WPF from time to time, but it’s a rare thing – but I’ll certainly consider using MVVM Light for UI-centric projects in future.</p>
<p>After this session I stayed around to chat with other attendees, the organisers and some Microsoft employees I’d met at previous events. It was a fun evening, and has certainly sparked my interest in going to other such events. I may even offer to present some of the work I’ve been doing to integrate Kinect with AutoCAD, which some members of the local .NET community may find of interest..</p>
<p>After checking out the other groups of interest on <a href="http://www.meetup.com" target="_blank">meetup.com</a>, I’ve signed up for <a href="http://www.meetup.com/zurich-fsharp-users" target="_blank">Zurich FSharp Users</a>, <a href="http://www.meetup.com/3D-Printing-Zurich" target="_blank">3D Printing Zurich</a> and <a href="http://www.meetup.com/ARCH-Swiss-Augmented-Reality" target="_blank">ARCH-Swiss Augmented Reality</a>, although I know I’ll end up having to pick and choose between the various physical meetings, if nothing else because of the distance involved. I see there are also meetups in Basel and Geneva – both of which are a bit nearer to my home town – so perhaps I’ll look for interesting groups to join there, too.</p>
