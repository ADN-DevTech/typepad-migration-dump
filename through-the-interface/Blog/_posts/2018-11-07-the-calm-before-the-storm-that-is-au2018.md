<p>We’re in the last few days before the biggest week in my calendar: Autodesk University in Las Vegas. As usual I’m trying my best to conserve strength in the week before the trip, as if preparing for a marathon. (There’s actually a half-marathon in Las Vegas on Sunday, so a number of AU attendees are preparing for that as well as AU itself. Utter craziness!)<a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad3be45a4200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="357" title="Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas" src="/assets/image_33309.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p align="center"><font color="#a5a5a5">Photo credit: James Marvin Phelps </font><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/66727626@N00/377859315"><font color="#a5a5a5">The Sign Says It All II</font></a><font color="#a5a5a5"> via </font><a href="http://photopin.com"><font color="#a5a5a5">photopin</font></a><font color="#a5a5a5"> </font><a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.0/"><font color="#a5a5a5">(license)</font></a></p><p>My handouts are uploaded and my slides are getting close to being presentable.

There are now 53 people registered for the Forge class (come on, people, we can do better than that!) and 133 + 105 for the Van Wijnen collaboration sessions. (The middle one has stayed the same at 181 as it’s full.)</p><p>I’m happy I’m going to get to meet many of you during the course of next week. Please don’t by shy about coming up and saying “Hi” and having a chat about what you’re working on. That’s honestly one of my favourite parts of the AU experience.</p>
