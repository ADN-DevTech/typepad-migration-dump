<p>The <a href="http://forge.autodesk.com/tracks-and-speakers" target="_blank">tracks</a> have now been posted for the upcoming <a href="http://forge.autodesk.com/conference" target="_blank">Forge DevCon</a> in SF on June 15-16, 2016:</p>
<ul>
<li>Forge Basics</li>
<li>AEC (including BIM and Generative Design)</li>
<li>Manufacturing – Design</li>
<li>Manufacturing ­– Making (including 3D printing and subtractive)</li>
<li>Manufacturing – Manage (including PLM, ERP and more)</li>
<li>Virtual Reality/Augmented Reality</li>
<li>Internet of Things</li>
<li>Business Development</li>
</ul>
<p>To give people an idea of the content, we’ve pulled together about 35 class descriptions of the 60 or so we expect to schedule.</p>
<p>I’m managing the VR/AR speaker track, so I’ve been spending time reaching out to and signing up speakers for the 8 or so sessions relating to that topic. Some of the speakers for the track will be from Autodesk, others will be external: for instance, I’ll be talking about collaborative VR using the View &amp; Data API, Michael Beale from the A360 cloud rendering team will be talking about stereo panoramas and <a href="http://wevr.com/team" target="_blank">Tony Parisi</a> will be talking about <a href="http://webvr.info" target="_blank">WebVR</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF" target="_blank">glTF</a> format.</p>
<p>I expect there to be a number of VR/AR vendors present in the exhibit area, too, so it’ll be an interesting opportunity to get a feel for the latest &amp; greatest in VR/AR tech, with a particular emphasis on how it all relates to the design and engineering industry.</p>
<p>And that’s just “my” track: there’s going to be plenty of cool stuff to see in the others, too!</p>
<p>Lastly, don’t forget that <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2016/02/early-bird-tickets-now-available-for-the-forge-devcon-in-sf.html" target="_blank">early bird discounts</a> are still available – until <strong>April 8</strong> – as well as some special offers for ADN members (check the recent DevNews for specifics). <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/forge-devcon-2016-tickets-21357894036" target="_blank">Register today!</a></p>
