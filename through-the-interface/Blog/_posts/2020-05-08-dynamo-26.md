<p>I’ve been banging pretty hard on <a href="https://dynamobim.org/dynamo-core-2-6-release/" target="_blank">Dynamo 2.6</a> – via Dynamo Sandbox – for the last few days, and I have to say I’ve been very impressed. Node renaming labels, code numbering, much improved PolyCurve performance… the combination of these various features have really helped with a project I’m working on right now (more on this next week).</p><p>Congratulations to the Dynamo and Matterlab teams for this compelling update. So far it’s really making a big difference.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20263ec1832b0200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="503" height="316" title="Dynamo 2.6" style="margin: 30px auto; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Dynamo 2.6" src="/assets/image_521884.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Check out <a href="https://dynamobim.org/dynamo-core-2-6-release/" target="_blank">Sol’s blog post</a> and head on over to <a href="https://dynamobuilds.com/" target="_blank">DynamoBuilds.com</a> to get the Sandbox build to try out!</p>
