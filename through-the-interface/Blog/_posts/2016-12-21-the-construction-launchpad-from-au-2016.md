<p>My biggest session from this year’s Autodesk University – and the only one that was recorded – has just gone <a href="http://au.autodesk.com/au-online/classes-on-demand/class-catalog/2016/class-detail/cs23128#chapter=0" target="_blank">live on the AU website</a>. The segment I’m part of starts 53 minutes into the recording, while I personally start talking at around the 1 hour mark, going through to 1h10.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><script height="281px" width="500px" src="http://player.ooyala.com/iframe.js#ec=BxdDBvNzE6vl9eudSS8l-LC3JCim7R1K&amp;pbid=34ee2c04f0304af88c76585f87c5bd8c"></script> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>It was an interesting experience, talking to 1,000 people in a single session. While the lead up was a little stressful, I’m certainly happy I did it and – looking back at the recording – feel pretty good about managing to get the main points across reasonably clearly.</p> <p>On a related note, the <a href="http://gems.autodesk.com/events/autodesk-university-london-2017-cfp/event-summary-c3a8107e83504cf1beb09c9fe183a1bb.aspx" target="_blank">call for proposals</a> has just opened for the first ever <a href="http://au.autodesk.com/london" target="_blank">AU London</a> – and the first English-speaking AU in Europe – for which I expect to submit at least one proposal. It should be a great event!</p>
