<p>On Monday I hopped onto the train to Geneva and from there onto the TGV to Paris Gare de Lyon.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20282e14df56d200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="TGV from Geneva to Paris" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="TGV from Geneva to Paris" src="/assets/image_971463.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>I was in Paris for <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2022/03/bim-world-paris-is-next-week.html" target="_blank">BIM World</a>, where we displayed the <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2022/02/building-the-2m-dar-smart-bridge.html" target="_blank">Dar 2m Smart Bridge</a>. It was my first time seeing the bridge in person, which was a really exciting moment for me.</p><p>After checking into <a href="https://www.hotelsaintebeuve.com/" target="_blank">a very nice little hotel in the 6th arrondissement</a> I headed to the conference centre to help with the setup.</p><p>The bridge was already unboxed and hooked up when I arrived.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20282e14df580200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Getting the bridge connected" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Getting the bridge connected" src="/assets/image_711466.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Pete Storey had some wires to connect to get it up and running.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20282e14df584200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Plugging in a few cables" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Plugging in a few cables" src="/assets/image_576496.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Many of the wires were actually for the temperature sensors and accelerometers: all the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber_Bragg_grating" target="_blank">FBG sensors</a> – for strain – are integrated into the structure and so required minimal connection work.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20278807553ed200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Pete is in the zone" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Pete is in the zone" src="/assets/image_674216.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>The physical setup of the bridge was straightforward, but on the software side we had some technical hitches that we’d been unable to anticipate: this was the first time we had in-person access to the bridge for the realtime sensor readings to be sent to <a href="https://dasher360.com" target="_blank">Dasher</a>, so we uncovered some really strange, low-level, timing-related issues with the realtime data display. We also had the misfortune of having a platform outage to contend with, which meant we couldn’t even effectively debug the problem until the first few hours of the event on Tuesday. (I tried to remote into the bridge’s computer to fix things after dinner on Monday night, but as the event organisers had cut off power after a certain point this didn’t end up being possible.)</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20282e14df589200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Selfie with the bridge" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Selfie with the bridge" src="/assets/image_522754.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>All in all this meant a second night of very little sleep before getting early to the event and waiting for the power to be restored to the bridge.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20282e14df5e8200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="The reception corner" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="The reception corner" src="/assets/image_532436.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>The bridge had a great spot along the side of the stand that had a lot of traffic coming through from the main entrance. This also meant that we had to field a lot of general questions, too (it’s amazing how many people are interested in Revit training!).</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202942fa31429200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="The bridge" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="The bridge" src="/assets/image_34548.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>I had a few stressful hours from 8am to around 10:30am, when we finally managed to get the data flowing properly between the bridge and Dasher. Here’s the moment when I was testing it out for the first time.<p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202942fa313ee200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Testing the bridge" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Testing the bridge" src="/assets/image_17383.jpg" border="0"></a></p></p><p>We had already chosen the red, white and blue colour palette long before, but it did occur to me that having the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_France" target="_blank">French national colours</a> was a happy coincidence.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2027880755407200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="The bridge display" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="The bridge display" src="/assets/image_68243.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Honestly I was super happy with the responsiveness of the system, once we had everything working. It was a relief – of course – but also really cool to see how well it worked.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202942fa31404200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="375" height="500" title="Testing the visualization" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Testing the visualization" src="/assets/image_742256.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Here’s a video that shows how responsive the system was.</p><p><br></p><p align="center"><iframe width="500" height="283" title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C8f5fHxD_cs" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"></iframe></p><p><br></p><p>My old friend Cyrille Fauvel was in Paris for BIM World, too, so got to walk across the bridge.<a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20282e14df5a8200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Cyrille crossing the bridge" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Cyrille crossing the bridge" src="/assets/image_237186.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>It was (as ever) nice to see Dasher being used to showcase our platform capabilities.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20282e14df5ad200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="The Forge booth" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="The Forge booth" src="/assets/image_462444.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Cyrille also talked about Forge – and Dasher – during his presentations at BIM World.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202788075540d200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Cyrille showing Dasher" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Cyrille showing Dasher" src="/assets/image_137971.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>The Piro brothers – Charles and Alexandre – presented a great session about Forge and Reality Capture, too. It was great to meet them in-person after many years of being connected.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202942fa313fc200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="The Piro brothers talking about Forge" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="The Piro brothers talking about Forge" src="/assets/image_883735.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>An unexpected surprise was bumping into Angelos Chronis. He always knows what’s going on, so found us a party to get the evening started.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20282e14df5ee200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Kean, Angelo and Pete" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Kean, Angelo and Pete" src="/assets/image_612008.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>After a hectic day of last-minute coding fixes and engaging with people in French, it was a welcome relief to have a relaxed seafood dinner at a restaurant in Montparnasse.<p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2027880755431200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="At dinner" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="At dinner" src="/assets/image_494157.jpg" border="0"></a></p></p><p>The calamari risotto was perfect.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20282e14df5f2200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Calamari risotto" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Calamari risotto" src="/assets/image_852762.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Here’s a quick photo with my Autodesk Research colleagues, Fikret Kalay and Pete Storey. It was really nice getting the chance to hang out with them both again.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20282e14df5f7200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Kean, Fikret and Pete" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Kean, Fikret and Pete" src="/assets/image_786021.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>I do like walking through Paris, even at night. Here’s a random photo of a metro station.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202788075543d200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="375" height="500" title="A metro station at night" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="A metro station at night" src="/assets/image_460266.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>On Wednesday both Fikret and I were on the presentation schedule.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202942fa31c6b200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="375" height="500" title="Today's presentation agenda" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Today's presentation agenda" src="/assets/image_959943.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Fikret talked at 10:15am about the bridge’s design and construction.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2027880755aa0200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Fikret presenting the bridge" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Fikret presenting the bridge" src="/assets/image_828082.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20282e14dfdb9200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Fikret talking" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Fikret talking" src="/assets/image_363234.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>From my side I spoke (in French, gulp!) at 10:45am about the digital twin side of things.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20282e14dfdbd200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="A decent crowd" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="A decent crowd" src="/assets/image_278851.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>I was very pleased to see so many people engaging in the topic.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2027880755ab1200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Me talking" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Me talking" src="/assets/image_556648.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>I’m now about to head to Gare de Lyon to make the trip back home. It’s been a fantastic couple of days, with some real highlights: catching up with some old friends, of course, but also being able to visualize data from the bridge in realtime using Dasher was a huge milestone for the project. I’m looking forward to more people being able to see the bridge, in the future: I’ve heard whispers about the bridge visiting a few more locations before heading back across to Dubai, but more on this in a future post.</p>
