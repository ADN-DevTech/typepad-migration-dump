<p>It’s music festival season in Europe, and we’ve been making the most of getting out to concerts and festivals in Switzerland.</p><p>The season kicked off for us while <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2023/07/caad-futures-2023.html" target="_blank">I was in Delft with my daughter</a>: my two sons went with a friend to the <a href="https://www.openair-frauenfeld.ch/2023-home/" target="_blank">Frauenfeld OpenAir festival</a> – the largest hip-hop festival in Europe, apparently – to see Travis Scott. It’s not really my thing, so I was happy enough they managed it all on their own (and came home safely, of course).</p><p>We often try to go to the <a href="https://www.montreuxjazzfestival.com/en/" target="_blank">Montreux Jazz Festival</a>. This year, on the last Monday of the event – July 10th – my wife and I had the chance to rush over and use some tickets offered by a friend to go and see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norah_Jones" target="_blank">Norah Jones</a>, an old favourite of ours. Her set was amazing, but so was the warm-up act: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mavis_Staples" target="_blank">Mavis Staples</a> (of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Staple_Singers" target="_blank">The Staple Singers</a> fame) turned 84 that day, and wowed the Stravinsky Auditorium audience with her still-incredible voice.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202b751ac40cb200c-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="Norah Jones" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_528569.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="Norah Jones" width="500" /></a></p><p>Two days later – on July 12th – we headed across to Bern to see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muse_(band)" target="_blank">Muse</a>, this time with the whole family. Sadly the weather turned bad – something we were woefully ill-prepared for – just as the concert started.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202c1b25a96a6200d-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="At Muse" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_929375.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="At Muse" width="500" /></a></p><p>The main support act was Royal Blood – they were very good, a big sound for a two-man act.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202c1a6cedad0200b-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="Royal Blood" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_701207.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="Royal Blood" width="500" /></a></p><p>Muse was just incredible. This is the third time I’ve seen them, over the years, and the shows get more and more impressive.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202b751ac4275200c-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="Muse" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_608825.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="Muse" width="500" /></a></p><p>We were quite near the stage and right next to the catwalk, so also had a great view.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202c1b25a9679200d-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="Muse - Matt Bellamy" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_890876.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="Muse - Matt Bellamy" width="500" /></a></p><p>I do love how Google Photos sometimes generates “panoramas” with visual artefacts. This one had Muse’s bass player in it three times.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202c1b25a9686200d-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="Muse - Chris Wolstenholme x 3" border="0" height="212" src="/assets/image_227672.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="Muse - Chris Wolstenholme x 3" width="500" /></a></p><p>By the time we arrived home we were utterly drenched and just a bit miserable. But it was such a good gig that overall I’d say it was worth it.</p><p>On Friday July 14th, I was back at Montreux, once again, this time with three very good friends who had offered me a trip to the Montreux Jazz Lab – to see <a href="https://overmono.com/" target="_blank">Overmono</a> and <a href="https://www.theblazeprod.com/" target="_blank">The Blaze</a> – for <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2023/04/50.html" target="_blank">my 50th birthday</a>.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202c1b25a9696200d-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="The boys in Montreux" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_466291.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="The boys in Montreux" width="500" /></a></p><p>I’d only heard a few tracks by The Blaze before then, and I will say that I was very impressed. Really nice, melodic electronic music.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202b751ac40d1200c-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="The Blaze" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_223658.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="The Blaze" width="500" /></a></p><p>Our last event of this 8-day musical extravaganza was at <a href="https://yeah.paleo.ch/en" target="_blank">Paleo</a>, a festival that is near and dear to my heart.</p><p>This is one of those festivals that we just love to go to, irrespective of who is playing. This year we managed to get tickets for the <a href="https://yeah.paleo.ch/en/line-up?_date=2023-07-18" target="_blank">Tuesday</a>, which had <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louise_Attaque" target="_blank">Louise Attaque</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Eyed_Peas" target="_blank">Black Eyed Peas</a> playing.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202c1b25a969f200d-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="At Paleo" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_302720.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="At Paleo" width="500" /></a></p><p>Louise Attaque were quite good: the first half was relatively low key, playing their early hits from the mid-to-late 90s. I zoned out a bit for the second half, where they brought on more musicians and played more recent numbers.</p><p>We managed to watch them from the top of a structure that afforded some pretty nice photo opportunities.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202c1a6cedae3200b-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="Paleo by day" border="0" height="121" src="/assets/image_612703.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="Paleo by day" width="500" /></a></p><p>These panoramas give a sense for the event during the day and at night.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202b751ac40d9200c-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="Paleo by night" border="0" height="138" src="/assets/image_531966.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="Paleo by night" width="500" /></a></p><p>I also had fun taking hyperlapse shots of the crowd.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202c1b25a9673200d-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="Paleo hyperlapse by night" height="281" src="/assets/image_428860.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; float: none; display: block;" title="Paleo hyperlapse by night" width="500" /></a></p><p>Between the concerts we headed for some food, and didn’t even try to get back up into the structure for the main event.</p><p>Honestly I didn’t regret not having a great view for Black Eyed Peas, who performed a largely disappointing set. I’m not a huge fan of theirs, anyway, but I definitely felt like this one was a little “phoned in”. They spent a lot of time talking to the audience – presumably to get their breath back, as most of them didn’t appear to be in peak form – and seemed to rely heavily on the videos shown on a large screen above their heads distracting the audience.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202c1a6cedc0d200b-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="Black Eyed Peas" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_852806.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="Black Eyed Peas" width="500" /></a></p><p>Despite the minor disappointment of the last gig, we still had a lot of fun over this intense 2-week period.</p><p>Right now we have a bit of a break before a couple more shows in August: there’s a metal festival from August 18th-20th called <a href="https://www.rockthelakes.ch/" target="_blank">Rock the Lakes</a> that we’re thinking about trying (a friend is helping organise it) and my daughter won a couple of free tickets to see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zara_Larsson" target="_blank">Zara Larsson</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robbie_Williams" target="_blank">Robbie Williams</a> at the <a href="https://zurichopenair.ch/en/" target="_blank">Zurich OpenAir</a> festival a few days afterwards on the 22nd.</p><p>All in all it’s shaping up to be a fun, musical summer, which makes up for the fact we’re probably not going anywhere very far. Partly this is due to us having a puppy to look after, but I do admit that staying here for the summer can be a lot of fun – and sometimes more relaxing – too.</p>
