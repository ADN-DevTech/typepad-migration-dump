<p>I’ve talked about this tool – which was developed by my good friend and colleague Murali Pappoppula and his team – a <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2013/08/project-memento-now-available-on-autodesk-labs.html" target="_blank">number</a> of <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2013/08/using-project-memento-to-manipulate-mesh-output-from-recap-photo.html" target="_blank">times</a> in the <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2014/02/reality-computing-updates.html" target="_blank">past</a>. I’m really enjoying seeing it mature, over time.</p>  <p>This latest version has the capability to send photos directly to the <a href="https://recap360.autodesk.com" target="_blank">Photo on ReCap 360</a> web-service, letting you pull the mesh down directly into Memento. Presumably it makes use of the new API that we have a number of ADN members piloting, right now.</p>  <p>Here’s a demo of the capabilities, taking you through from photo import to 3D printing:</p>  <br /><iframe height="264" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/ehmSlWI1htU?rel=0" frameborder="0" width="470" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>  <br />  <br />  <p>And here’s <a href="http://tinyurl.com/k6qtuwd" target="_blank">a more detailed description of the improvements in this release</a> (you need an Autodesk account to log in to the Beta site to access this, as it's currently an Autodesk Labs technology preview). If you haven't already joined the project, you can <a href="https://beta.autodesk.com/callout/?callid=D69655022B4F42C880513D4E3085C7D0" target="_blank">sign up here</a>.
