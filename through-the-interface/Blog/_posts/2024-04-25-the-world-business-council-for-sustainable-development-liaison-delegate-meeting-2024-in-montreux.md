<p>The title of this post is quite the mouthful, but I thought I’d expand out the acronyms for everyone.</p>
<p>Last week a colleague asked if I’d like to join an event that was being held quite locally to me, one that Autodesk has participated in for a number of years now. It’s the WBCSD (World Building Council for Sustainable Development) Liaison Delegate Meeting. Basically delegates from the member companies are invited to join a 3-day event to discuss topics related to transforming there businesses to be more sustainable.</p>

<p>I couldn’t make the full three days at such late notice, but I did manage to head across on the train on Wednesday (Day 2) early enough to arrive in Montreux at around 8am.</p>

<p>The event was held in the Fairmont Montreux Palace Hotel.<a href="/assets/image_934436.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="The Montreux Palace Hotel.jpeg" src="/assets/image_934436.jpg" alt="The Montreux Palace Hotel." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>The gardens have a lovely view across Lac Leman.</p>

<p>Most of our time was spent indoors, though. The morning had plenary sessions with a number of interesting speakers and panel discussions.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_809105.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="2nd day keynote.jpeg" src="/assets/image_809105.jpg" alt="2nd day keynote." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>During the afternoon there were a breakouts. Given my own research focus, I was interested by the nature-centric sessions.</p>
<p>The event was applying the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatham_House_rule">Chatham House Rule</a> (a new one on me!) which meant not sharing photos or videos of attendees. I’ve included a few static images, but have blurred out any detail that might otherwise have been used to identify my fellow attendees.</p>
<p>One session was a role-play applying a blueprint for implementing nature-based solutions (NbS).<a href="/assets/image_656749.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="NbS.jpeg" src="/assets/image_656749.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>The next was about nature climate solutions (NCS), which focused heavily on tools such as carbon credits.</p>

<p>The day wrapped up with a gala dinner. All - very appropriately - vegetarian, which suited me very well.</p>

<p>Overall the event was a fascinating departure from my usual day-to-day activities. I’m admittedly much more comfortable at events populated by software developers and architectural technologists - they’re my people! - but I enjoyed being part of so many discussions I would otherwise have had no reason to. And it was great hanging out with Rama Dunayevich and Marta Bouchard for the day. Thanks for inviting me, Rama!</p>
