I’ll try to do a little live blogging here… so check back often. And remember to <a href="https://plus.google.com/events/c9lru7ai8o806s6p01vlccok1uk" target="_blank">join me in the Google Hangout</a>!</p> <p> <hr> 15:10 CEST / 6:10 PDT  <p>Sitting here with at Autodesk Neuchatel with Celine and Camilo (aka ^CEL and ^CAM from <a href="http://twitter.com/autodeskhelp" target="_blank">AutodeskHelp</a>), waiting for the questions to come in.</p> <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201bb0902227b970d-pi" target="_blank"><img title="Autodesk Answerers" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 30px auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="Autodesk Answerers" src="/assets/image_562609.jpg" width="504" height="286"></a></p> <p> <hr> 16:50 CEST / 7:50 PDT  <p>Well, the Hangout was interesting. On the one hand, I didn’t realise you had to enable Q&amp;A before launching the “Hangout On Air”, but on the other hand, noone else joined so it didn’t really matter. Silver linings and all that. I stayed in the call for 15 minutes before I managed to terminate it (with a view to relaunching with Q&amp;A enabled, which turned out not to be possible).</p> <p>The recording is on YouTube, but as it’s basically of me talking to myself and looking confused, I’ve made it private. It’s funny enough, just not very useful.</p> <p>Hopefully I’ll work out how to make better use of Hangouts before trying another one. If people are still motivated to join one of these, please do say so: I’m definitely not against getting together and chatting about API-related topics, but it’s less fun when you’re on your own, I must say.</p> <p>Anyway, in the meantime, I’ve answered <a href="http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/visual-lisp-autolisp-and-general/draw-polyline-to-nearest-point/td-p/6333224" target="_blank">my first question</a>.</p> <p> <hr> 18:10 CEST / 9:10 PDT</p> <p>My shift is supposedly over, at this stage, but it started slowly and there are more questions coming in. Here’s <a href="http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/net/oauth-with-entitlement-api/m-p/6334182" target="_blank">one regarding the entitlement API</a>. This is actually more fun than I expected!</p> <p> <hr> 19:30 CEST / 10:30 PDT</p> <p>OK, that’s it for this Answer Day. It was an interesting experience. I ended up answering four or five questions (with some iterations), two of which were accepted as solutions. I even received a kudo, which felt nice.</p> <p>From what I can tell, most questions were answered across the various products – hopefully you had a good experience if you asked anything!</p>
