<p>For information regarding the upcoming release of AutoCAD 2009 and it's siblings (and perhaps its cousins? :-), check out <a href="http://autodesk.blogs.com/between_the_lines/2008/02/the-2009-produc.html">this post on Shaan Hurley's Between the Lines</a>.</p>

<p>My team has been working on API samples for this release, some of which I'll introduce over the coming weeks. Watch this space!</p>
