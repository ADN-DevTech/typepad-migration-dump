<p>On Wednesday I came across to Dublin for the latter part of the APS Accelerator being held, here.</p><p>Jaime Rosales – who has been here with Sergio Leone and Adam Nagy from the APS Developer Advocacy and Support team – has taken some lovely pictures during this trip. The better ones in this post were taken by him.</p><p>I unfortunately just missed Peter Schlipf – who was here for the first half of the week – which was a great shame.</p><p>Here are some pictures of the city. We were mostly staying in the Hilton Garden Inn, so to get to the office we crossed the River Liffey on a footbridge that runs parallel to the Samuel Beckett Bridge.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202af14a97ad6200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="336" title="The Samuel Beckett Bridge" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="The Samuel Beckett Bridge" src="/assets/image_270136.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202af1c932a8b200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="333" title="Gulls" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Gulls" src="/assets/image_485471.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>This is the bridge we cross to get to the office,&nbsp; as we look back across towards the hotel.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202af14a97ae3200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Looking back across to the Hilton Garden Inn" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Looking back across to the Hilton Garden Inn" src="/assets/image_965552.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>The weather has been sunny – but very cold – since I arrived.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202af1487e780200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Walking to the office" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Walking to the office" src="/assets/image_252987.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>The Samuel Becket Bridge is lit up at nighttime with an animated display.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202af14a97ada200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="The Samuel Beckett Bridge by night" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="The Samuel Beckett Bridge by night" src="/assets/image_872377.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>The famous doors of Dublin are still here, I’m happy to report.<a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202af1487e788200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="333" title="Dublin doors" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Dublin doors" src="/assets/image_143528.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Food in the city is as good as I remember.
