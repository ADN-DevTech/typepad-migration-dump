<p><em>I’ve decided to interrupt my series on <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2012/09/creating-a-face-recognising-security-cam-with-a-raspberry-pi-part-1.html" target="_blank">creating a</a> <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2012/09/creating-a-face-recognising-security-cam-with-a-raspberry-pi-part-2.html" target="_blank">face-recognising</a> <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2012/09/creating-a-face-recognising-security-cam-with-a-raspberry-pi-part-3.html" target="_blank">security cam</a> to cover another Raspberry Pi-related topic, this week. I’ll try to finish my series write-up for next Wednesday.</em></p>
<p>At the recommendation of an old friend from University, I recently devoured the excellent “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ready_Player_One" target="_blank">Ready Player One</a>” by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Cline" target="_blank">Ernest Cline</a>. Ernest was apparently born about a year before me, so to say that the copious <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ready_Player_One#Pop_culture_references_in_the_novel" target="_blank">pop-culture references</a> from the 1980s resonated would be a massive under-statement. I just wish I’d come across it sooner (in time to have a shot at solving <a href="http://www.ernestcline.com/rp1contest" target="_blank">the Easter Egg and winning a 1981 DeLorean</a>, complete with a sadly non-functioning flux capacitor).</p>
<p>As <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Draper" target="_blank">Don Draper</a> famously said in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Men" target="_blank">Mad Men</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Nostalgia - it&#39;s delicate, but potent. Teddy told me that in Greek, &quot;nostalgia&quot; literally means &quot;the pain from an old wound.&quot; It&#39;s a twinge in your heart far more powerful than memory alone.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ready Player One definitely had me pining to relive some of my early computing experiences – whether programming or playing – and so I decided to have a bit of fun with my second Raspberry Pi device (the first is a <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2012/09/creating-a-face-recognising-security-cam-with-a-raspberry-pi-part-1.html" target="_blank">little</a>&#0160;<a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2012/09/creating-a-face-recognising-security-cam-with-a-raspberry-pi-part-2.html" target="_blank">busy</a>… I’ll be telling you more about its exploits over the coming weeks).</p>
<p>I’ve mentioned a few of <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2008/06/a-simple-turtle.html" target="_blank">these</a> <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2009/07/converting-between-c-and-vbnet.html" target="_blank">experiences</a> before, but over a recent rainy weekend I decided to see if I could track down and build or install emulators for the main computing platforms of my youth onto the Raspberry Pi.</p>
<p>Here’s what I found… (the images of the emulators have been taken on my Mac with the graphics streamed down from the Raspberry Pi and displayed using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System" target="_blank">X11</a>, mainly to make it easier to grab screenshots.)</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRS-80#Model_III" target="_blank"><img align="right" alt="TRS-80 Model III" border="0" height="149" src="/assets/image_140841.jpg" style="background-image: none; margin: 0px 0px 10px 20px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; float: right; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="TRS-80 Model III" width="201" /><strong>TRS-80 Model III</strong></a></p>
<p>I can’t remember whether I first programmed on the BBC Micro or the TRS-80, but the TRS-80 Model III was certainly the first computer I had access to at home (well, in my father’s home office). It was also my first exposure to computer games – I remember even now many of the problems in <a href="http://www.trs-80.com/wordpress/emulation-scott-adams/software-adventures-09/" target="_blank">Ghost Town</a>, an early text adventure from <a href="http://www.msadams.com/adventures.htm" target="_blank">Scott Adams</a> (one that you can now <a href="http://www.ifiction.org/games/play.php?cat=44&amp;game=35&amp;mode=html" target="_blank">play on-line</a>, of all things).</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.trs-80.com/wordpress/emulators" target="_blank">emulator</a> I ended up building for the TRS-80 was <a href="http://sdltrs.sourceforge.net" target="_blank">SDLTRS</a>, which actually proved to be straightforward to download and build. I couldn’t track down a posted ROM for the Model III, but I did get one for the Model I, which then allowed me to load LDOS from an emulated floppy-drive:</p>
<p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2017ee3efca3a970d-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="LDOS on the TRS-80 Model I via SDLTRS" border="0" height="315" src="/assets/image_911377.jpg" style="background-image: none; margin: 20px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="LDOS on the TRS-80 Model I via SDLTRS" width="384" /></a></p>
<p>The dates seem a bit off – I guess I’m using a really recent version of the LDOS ROM in order for it to say copyright 1991, and as for the date being 1912… Y2K issues, anyone?</p>
<p>I’m yet to do anything useful with this emulator – I’m really struggling to remember how to load data from a floppy, for starters – but just seeing it again brings back floods of memories.</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2017d3c7a68ee970c-pi" target="_blank"><strong><img align="right" alt="BBC Micro" border="0" height="124" src="/assets/image_607030.jpg" style="background-image: none; margin: 0px 0px 10px 20px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; float: right; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="BBC Micro" width="174" /></strong></a><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Micro" target="_blank">BBC Microcomputer Model B</a></strong></p>
<p>This was the first computer I worked with at school and used to spend many, many happy hours fooling around with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language)" target="_blank">Logo</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Micro#BBC_BASIC" target="_blank">BASIC</a>.</p>
<p>The emulator I found for this was <a href="http://beebem-unix.bbcmicro.com/download/beebem-0.0.13.tar.gz" target="_blank">BeebEm</a>, which required downloading, extracting and building, in much the same way SDLTRS did.</p>
<p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2017c324c1bb6970b-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="BBC Basic on the BBC Micro via BeebEm" border="0" height="310" src="/assets/image_434289.jpg" style="background-image: none; margin: 20px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="BBC Basic on the BBC Micro via BeebEm" width="390" /></a></p>
<p>Again, I don’t yet have anything running inside this emulator (my main memories are of Logo, Chuckie Egg and Elite), but will try to do something fun, at some point.</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX_Spectrum" target="_blank"><img align="right" alt="ZX Spectrum 128K" border="0" height="162" src="/assets/image_267012.jpg" style="background-image: none; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; float: right; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="ZX Spectrum 128K" width="253" /><strong>ZX Spectrum</strong></a></p>
<p>I used to love playing games on the ZX Spectrum (my brother and I shared a Spectrum+, as pictured here). While the TRS-80 and BBC Micro were mostly (for me, at least) about learning, the Spectrum was (almost) all about fun.</p>
<p>We used it mostly for games, but I do remember having lots of fun using it with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currah#Currah_Microspeech_for_the_ZX_Spectrum" target="_blank">the Currah Microspeech device</a> to synthesise something approaching human speech.</p>

<p>The Spectrum emulator I installed – and this was <a href="http://raspi.tv/tag/spectrum-emulator-in-raspbian" target="_blank">super simple</a>, no building needed – was <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/archives/883" target="_blank">Fuse</a>.</p>
<p>Once installed, I went looking for <a href="http://www.worldofspectrum.org/archive.html" target="_blank">ROMs of games I used to play</a>. There are a lot out there, happily. Here’s a screenshot of Manic Miner in action:</p>
<p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2017c324c1bdb970b-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="Manis Minor on the ZX Spectrum via Fuse" border="0" height="315" src="/assets/image_481758.jpg" style="background-image: none; margin: 20px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="Manis Minor on the ZX Spectrum via Fuse" width="378" /></a></p>
<p>One really good thing about running Manic Miner via X11 is the lack of support for sound (I couldn’t hear the ghastly, discordant 8-bit music that plays once the game has loaded ;-).</p>

<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>The final touch for my retro computing system was an incredible all-round emulator called <a href="http://themaister.net/retroarch.html" target="_blank">RetroArch</a>. To install this and the <a href="https://github.com/Aloshi/EmulationStation" target="_blank">EmulationStation</a> graphical front-end, I used the very handy <a href="https://github.com/petrockblog/RetroPie-Setup" target="_blank">RetroPie-Setup</a> script.</p>
<p>I mainly installed this piece as my wife cut her gaming teeth on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda_(video_game)" target="_blank">the Legend of Zelda</a> on the NES, and that seemed the simplest way to get that working. I also wanted to get MAME on the device, as there are a number of classic arcade games I wanted to be able to play, too.</p>
<p>The graphics generated by RetroArch are not piped via X11, so I don’t have any screenshots for that. But the games seem to look and play as well as I remember.</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p><strong>Wrap-up</strong></p>
<p>The system looks and works really well. For me it’s just amazing that it’s possible to pack in this kind of capability into such a small (and cheap!) device. I suppose it’s not necessarily the mark of progress – or indeed very surprising – that over the course of 30 years you can shrink the capabilities of all these computers into a credit-card sized device, but it&#39; is nonetheless very cool. Long live nostalgia!</p>
<p>By the way, to finish off this device from an aesthetic perspective, I went ahead and bought a <a href="http://petrockblog.wordpress.com/2012/08/07/petrockblock-pie-a-gaming-raspberry-pi-case" target="_blank">PetRockBlock Pie, a beautiful gaming-focused case from maker of the RetroPie-setup</a> (I’ve used the image from their website – mine is actually an also-very-attractive transparent acrylic version):</p>
<p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2017c324c4673970b-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="PetRockBlock case" border="0" height="319" src="/assets/image_659558.jpg" style="background-image: none; margin: 20px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="PetRockBlock case" width="319" /></a></p>
<p>This case is ideal for people wanting to wire up old-school controllers (I’m think of raiding my in-laws’ attic to get some NES gamepads to connect up), but for now I’ve gone and bought a wired Xbox 360 controller that comes by default with a USB connector… less retro but also less soldering. ;-) Getting that working was a little tricky, but the xboxdrv driver is really simple to install, and I now have it set up to launch with the classic Q-A-O-P-Space (up, down, left, right, fire) keyboard mapping when playing Spectrum games, and a different configuration when using RetroArch.</p>
<p>I’ll have this with me at AU, in case anyone want to take a look (and maybe even find a screen in the exhibit hall to have a play ;-).</p>
