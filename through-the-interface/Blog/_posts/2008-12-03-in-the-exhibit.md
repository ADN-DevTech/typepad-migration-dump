Brandon also has an interest in F#, and will be attending one of the classes I'm delivering tomorrow, <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2008/10/au-handouts-aut.html">"AutoCAD® .NET - Developing for AutoCAD® Using F#"</a>.</p> <p><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/X_bZs8ZlWzc&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1" width="425" height="344" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always"></embed></p>
