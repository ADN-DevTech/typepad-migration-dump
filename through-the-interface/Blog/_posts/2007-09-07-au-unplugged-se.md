<p>Just a quick post today regarding an <a href="http://au.autodesk.com/2007/blogs/view/New_at_AU_AU_Unplugged/">AU Unplugged!</a> topic I've submitted.</p>

<p>The proposed session is called &quot;<em>Developing applications for AutoCAD: best practices for using AutoCAD's APIs.</em>&quot; Here's the description I gave for the topic:</p><blockquote dir="ltr"><p>&quot;Come along to share and learn best practices for customizing/developing with AutoCAD: discuss your choice of API technology and how best to address common development issues. Find out where best to focus your learning around AutoCAD customization.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>If you're interested in attending this (and <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2007/08/autodesk-univer.html">other developer-oriented Autodesk University sessions</a>), you can register for the conference at <a href="http://au.autodesk.com/2007/">AU Online</a>. I don't know whether the Unplugged event will be approved, but I'm excited by the concept and curious to see how it works in practice...</p>
