I think that ADGE stood for “Autodesk Developer Group Europe”, but the A might also have been for AUGI. Any old-timers out there who can confirm? (I’m sure <a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com" target="_blank">Jeremy Tammik</a> remembers. :-)</p>  <p>Anyway, the ADGE conference that year was held at CERN, which was really cool. As part of the entertainment we had a tour around the facilities, including the <a href="http://home.web.cern.ch/about/accelerators" target="_blank">accelerator complex</a> – although some time before construction of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_Hadron_Collider" target="_blank">Large Hadron Collider</a> was started.</p>  <p>So here I find myself about to head back there this afternoon for <a href="http://tedxcern.web.cern.ch" target="_blank">TEDxCERN</a>. This will be my second TEDx event this year, having attended <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2014/02/tedxlausanne.html" target="_blank">TEDxLausanne</a> back in February. Understandably, given the location, <a href="http://tedxcern.web.cern.ch/programme" target="_blank">today’s programme</a> looks to be a bit more “sciencey”, which is great. And there are at least a couple of names I already know from <a href="http://tedxcern.web.cern.ch/speakers" target="_blank">the list of speakers</a>, which is another good sign.</p>
