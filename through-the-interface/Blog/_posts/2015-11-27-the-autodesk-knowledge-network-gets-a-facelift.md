<p>It’s been a couple of years since I last reported on an <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2013/11/the-autodesk-community-gets-a-facelift.html" target="_blank">Autodesk web property getting cosmetic surgery</a>. The AKN team has just unveiled <a href="http://autode.sk/1ST3P3F" target="_blank">a revamped portal</a> enabling people to create, share and remix knowledge, whether of their industry or their usage of a particular product.</p>
<p>Here’s <a href="https://knowledge.autodesk.com/profile/O28IG582EKE313AA" target="_blank">my AKN profile</a>, showing that I’ve contributed some screencasts but (so far) no articles. We’ll have to see what we can do about that. :-)</p>
<p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b7c7f140c1970b-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="My AKN profile" border="0" height="333" src="/assets/image_427212.jpg" style="background-image: none; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 50px auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;" title="My AKN profile" width="375" /></a></p>
<p>Here’s some information I received from the Screencast team that describes the change:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your profile is an opportunity to showcase who you are and promote your contributions. Share this page with others in your network. It’s like a portfolio of knowledge that lets others know where you excel. You can also include links to other social media communities, confirming the breadth of your community involvement.</p>
<p>Posting information to AKN is simple and straightforward. With the new editor, you can document your favorite tips &amp; tricks, product how-to’s, tutorials, and other help or support information. Articles can be in English, German, or Japanese.&#0160; Screencasts&#0160; can be in one of 14 languages: Chinese Simplified , Chinese Traditional,&#0160; Czech,&#0160; English, French,&#0160; German,&#0160; Hungarian, Italian, Japanese,&#0160; Korean,&#0160; Polish,&#0160; Portuguese, Russian, Spanish.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This looks like an interesting place to both acquire knowledge and help build your industry reputation. Be sure to check it out.</p>

<p>Tomorrow I’ll be heading across to Las Vegas for <a href="http://au.autodesk.com/las-vegas/overview" target="_blank">AU 2015</a>. If you see me wandering around the corridors of The Venetian, please do take the time to introduce yourself and tell me what you’re working on. Those kind of interactions are one of my favourite things about AU. See you in Vegas!</p>
