<p>Welcome to Floppy <em>Ferrari</em> Friday! In <a href="https://youtu.be/ChRvMdeKong" rel="noopener" target="_blank">this week’s episode</a> we look at two classic video game experiences that allow you to drive a Ferrari.</p>
<p>The first is one I’ve been meaning to play for some time and <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2020/12/floppy-friday-6.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">mentioned back in Floppy Friday #6</a>: the classic 1985 arcade game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out_Run" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Out Run</a>. It was fun to play the Commodore 64 version – and on a classic “<a href="https://www.lemon64.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=61224&amp;amp;start=15" rel="noopener" target="_blank">breadbin</a>” C64, no less – but I will say I found the conversion to be a little lacklustre. I certainly enjoyed the arcade version more.</p>
<p>The second is a much more “serious” experience, which is <a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferrari_Formula_One" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Ferrari Formula One</a>. (It’s interesting – and perhaps logical – that the wikipedia page is only available in Italian… well, there is a much shorter French version, but certainly no English one.)</p>

<p><br /></p>
<p>I mentioned the state of the C64 I’m using when I bought it. Here’s the photo from the auction site:</p>
<p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20263e98a143f200b-pi" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Recent breadbin C64 auction" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_362475.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="Recent breadbin C64 auction" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>I really had very low expectations about whether it would prove to work, but I’m so happy I went and ahead and bid on it: the 1541 floppy drive is really the best one I have, and it wasn’t very complicated to get the C64 working well.</p>
<p>I mentioned in the video the process I followed to get Out Run onto a physical floppy, despite not having it in my set: I was able to connect my <a href="http://www.go4retro.com/products/zoomfloppy/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ZoomFloppy</a> card to the above floppy drive and then send commands from my PC connected via a mini-USB cable to reformat a disk and copy the contents of <a href="https://csdb.dk/release/?id=27074" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a .D64 ROM</a> to it.</p>
<p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20278800f367e200d-pi" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="ZoomFloppying" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_903593.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="ZoomFloppying" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>I’d originally purchased the ZoomFloppy to allow me to archive the various floppies I have (a job I haven’t yet started), but I very much like that it allows me to go the other way. This is going to allow me to take requests without worrying about whether I have the floppy somewhere in my collection (and even try out an early CAD package – <a href="https://commodore.software/downloads/download/151-miscellaneous-applications/885-home-designer-128-v2-4" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Home Designer</a> – once I have a Commodore 128 in my possession).</p>
<p>In this episode I also mentioned <a href="http://www.zzap64.co.uk/cgi-bin/displaypage.pl?issue=060&amp;page=008&amp;thumbstart=0&amp;magazine=zzap" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a review in Zzap64 magazine of Ferrari Formula One</a>:</p>

<p>Hopefully the “dying wasp” audio effect is reproduced faithfully in the YouTube video.</p><p><strong><em>Update:</em></strong></p><p>It turns out that unplugging/replugging a joystick from/into a C64 while it’s running is a huge no-no, and a great way to fry delicate chips. My C64 is thankfully still running, but I’m going to bear this feedback very much in mind, moving forward. Please do the same yourselves!</p>
