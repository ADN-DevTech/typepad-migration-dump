<p>As we’re in the middle of the 2021 Olympics – well, more honestly because I happened to stumble across the floppy it was on – <a href="https://youtu.be/607u3waKMmA" rel="noopener" target="_blank">this week’s episode</a> is all about the sports-related games contained in <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/ball-games-pack" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Ball Games Pack</a> for the Commodore 64.</p>
<p>This compilation contains four games, one of which we played in <a href="https://keanw.com/2021/07/floppy-friday-36.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Floppy Friday #36</a> (the classic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_Manager_(1982_video_game)" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Football Manager</a>), so this week we just played the other three: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kick_Off_(series)" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Kick Off</a> – a very decent yet fairly tricky soccer (yes, football) game – followed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_Coach_(video_game)" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Head Coach</a> – a Football Manager-like game for American Football fans – and finally <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/golf-master" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Golf Master</a> (which also appears to have gone by the name of Challenge Golf).</p>
<p>It ended up being quite a long episode – despite seeing only three games – mainly because I had trouble working out how to exit practice mode in the first game. Sigh.</p>

<p>I may well stick with the sports theme for next week’s episode – there’s an “indoor sports” floppy that’s begging for me to try – but we’ll see what happens next week.</p>
