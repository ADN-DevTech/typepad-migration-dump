<p>Next week the <a href="https://www.ril.fi/en" target="_blank">Finnish Association of Civil Engineers (RIL)</a> is holding a virtual conference on the use of Artificial Intelligence in Architecture, Engineering and Construction called <a href="http://www.aiaec.net/" target="_blank">AI in AEC 2021</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.ril.fi/media/2021-ai-in-aec/ai-in-aec-2021-programme.pdf" target="_blank">The agenda</a> looks really compelling. These are the presentation tracks, to give you a sense for the topics covered:</p><ul><li>Data Driven Design</li><li>Generative Design</li><li>Impactful AI</li><li>Project Management</li><li>Natural Language Processing</li><li>Smart Buildings</li><li>Circular Economy</li><li>Data Analytics</li><li>Quality Control &amp; Verification</li><li>Autonomous Construction</li></ul><p>There are three keynote presentations: two at the opening of the conference at 10am CET on March 24th, while the third (which I’ve been asked to deliver) is at the closing at 4:20pm CET on March 25th.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2026bdec40ca4200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="281" title="AI in AEC 2021" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="AI in AEC 2021" src="/assets/image_15778.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>I’ll be talking about our work as part of <a href="https://dasher360.com" target="_blank">Project Dasher</a> to capture and visualize realworld performance of the built environment, and how this data is increasingly going to feed into the generative design process.</p><p>If you’re one of the 200+ people attending this conference, then I’m looking forward to seeing you on March 25th and answering any questions you might have about this topic. If you’re unable to attend for whatever reason – and this isn’t a free conference, there is a fee to <a href="https://www.ril.fi/en/events/ai-in-aec-2021/registration.html" target="_blank">register</a> – then you can access a <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/autodesk-university/content/Building-the-Infrastructure-for-Performance-Based-Generative-Design" target="_blank">cut-down version of this session from the Autodesk University site</a>.</p>
