<p>Halloween nearly passed me by completely, this year: the kids did dress up on Friday night – and we had some trick-or-treaters come by over the weekend and this evening – but things have been so hectic, lately, that we didn’t hold our (in recent years) annual Halloween party. Next year we’ll hopefully have the energy to do another one.</p> <p>To celebrate the occasion in a modest way, at least, I found a nice pumpkin model on the <a href="https://gallery.autodesk.com/fusion360/projects/23852/fusion-pumpkin" target="_blank">Fusion 360 gallery</a> and uploaded it to <a href="http://vrok.it" target="_blank">Vrok-It</a>:</p> <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b8d2347198970c-pi" target="_blank"><img title="Fusion 360 pumpkin in Vrok-It" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 30px auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="Fusion 360 pumpkin in Vrok-It" src="/assets/image_44963.jpg" width="500" height="346"></a></p> <p>You’ll find it on the left-sash at the top of the list (for now, anyway). When loaded on your phone, you’ll be able to see it in its full stereoscopic glory:</p> <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b7c8aaa601970b-pi" target="_blank"><img title="Stereo pumpkin" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 30px auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="Stereo pumpkin" src="/assets/image_510787.jpg" width="500" height="281"></a></p> <p>Happy Halloween, everyone!</p>
