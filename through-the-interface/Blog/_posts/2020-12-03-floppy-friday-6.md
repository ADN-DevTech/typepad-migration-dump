<p>In this week’s episode we take a look at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missile_Command" target="_blank">Missile Command</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impossible_Mission" target="_blank">Impossible Mission</a>, and also talk about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out_Run" target="_blank">Out Run</a> – another of my arcade faves from back in the day. A shout-out to both Matt Armitage and Marco Fiocco, who were the inspiration for the games played.</p><p align="center"><br></p><p align="center"><iframe width="500" height="283" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/g7cByfBXTfc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"></iframe></p><p><br></p><p>I’m very happy with how my system is shaping up: as mentioned in the video I now have a few hundred more floppies, some new old joysticks and a fixed video cable.</p><p>For next week’s episode – depending on when the replacement chips arrive and whether they actually help – I may have a second functioning floppy drive (the huge 1541). I still have a number of games (including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles_(NES_video_game)" target="_blank">TMNT</a>, Clint ;-) that don’t load or play, for one reason or another, so a second functioning drive should help me understand what’s happening with those. We’ll see!</p>
