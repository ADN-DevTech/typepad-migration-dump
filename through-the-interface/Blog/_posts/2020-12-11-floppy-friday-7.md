<p>This week’s Floppy Friday is slightly shorter and probably no sweeter, showcasing two fun Commodore 64 games that came in as viewer requests. Stefano Metrangolo asked that I try to find <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Soccer" rel="noopener" target="_blank">International Soccer</a> (which also goes by the names of International Football or Cup Final, in some places) and Clint Brown requested <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles_(NES_video_game)" rel="noopener" target="_blank">TMNT</a> (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, or in this case Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles). As you’ll see in the video, to load the game I needed a “mission code” sheet, that luckily <a href="https://www.c64copyprotection.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/TMNT-FIXED.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">still exists online</a>.</p>

<p>I hope you enjoy the nostalgia hit, Stefano and Clint!</p>
<p>Please do keep the requests coming, everyone. I have a number of interesting games in the hopper for the next few episodes, and I’m going my best to keep the list of requests handy so that whenever possible I can make this exploration a bit more personal (and fun!).</p>
