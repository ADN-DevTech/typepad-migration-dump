<p>Colleagues in Autodesk Research are working on some really interesting technology that you can try out at AU2019. There’s an Idea Exchange study entitled “<em>Generative Design in VR for Structural Engineering</em>” being held at these times during the conference:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tuesday November 19th, 12pm–3pm and 3:30pm–6pm</li>
<li>Wednesday November 20th, 3:30pm–6pm</li>
</ul>
<p>Those interested just need to swing by the Idea Exchange (it’s a big space on the way to exhibition hall and will be hard to miss) during these timeslots and let the recruiter know they want to participate in the study. It takes about 15 minutes to complete, and will be run on a first-come, first-served basis.</p>

<p>Why are we running this study? We’re exploring how generative design and immersive experiences could help break down silos between roles in the AEC industry. Our hope is to help bring disciplines closer together, as early in the process as possible.</p>

<p>During the study, we’ll give an exclusive preview of our new generative experience prototype and ask for feedback on both the usability aspects and the general vision of AEC workflows of the future. The prototype focuses around the generative design of building structures. Our premise being that you cannot implement “design to make” workflows in AEC without some automation of the Engineering.</p>

However, we are open to hearing from other AEC professionals too.</p>

<p>People participating in the study will clearly get access to much more detailed information (subject to signing a special agreement, as is usual for such things). Do make a point of coming along and giving it a try, if you can!</p>

<p>I’ve been told that there’s a special mode where flooring slabs can be hidden, to better assess the internal building structure. I’m only going to try this myself with the firm assurance that this mode does not get switched on while I’m at the top of a building!</p>
<p><em>Many thanks to Dagmara Szkurlat for putting together most of the above information.</em></p>
