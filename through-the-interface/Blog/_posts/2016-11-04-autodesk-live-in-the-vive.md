<p>I’ve finally found the time to get <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2016/10/demonic-possession.html" target="_blank">one of the new Demons bound to my service</a>&#0160;installed with Autodesk VRED, Revit and LIVE.</p>
<p>I had some teething issues getting the HTC Vive to work: my rookie mistake was thinking I could connect it to a DisplayPort via a basic DP –&gt; HDMI dongle. This was enough for the PC – and Steam VR – to detect it, but not enough for anything to show inside the HMD. After a phone consult with Merten Stroetzel, I fixed it by having it come off the DVI port (another option would be to use a powered DP –&gt; HDMI convertor, but in the end a single DVI –&gt; HDMI dongle did the trick). Thanks, Merten!</p>
<p>So we now have functioning VR, albeit in a slightly small space. It’s more cubicle-scale than room-scale, right now. :-) The work on our VR room will be completed in December, so I’ll be able to install the systems then in a much more usable environment.</p>
<p>Having installed LIVE, I decided to give its Revit –&gt; Stringray workflow a try with the honking great model we’ve been using for Dasher 360 (the 210 King Street East building in Toronto, <a href="http://www.digital210king.org" target="_blank">a version of which is available online</a>, incidentally).</p>
<p>Launching LIVE was a simple matter of clicking on the ribbon button…</p>
<p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201bb094f1a34970d-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="The LIVE button in Revit" border="0" height="312" src="/assets/image_910134.jpg" style="background-image: none; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 30px auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="The LIVE button in Revit" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Some issues were found with the model’s materials, which I chose to ignore (but you’d typically want to address before launching). The below process did take quite some time – it’s a really big model, as I said – but it didn’t need my involvement at all.</p>
<p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b8d235e0f8970c-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="Publishing via the LIVE web-service" height="258" src="/assets/image_453641.jpg" style="float: none; margin: 30px auto; display: block;" title="Publishing via the LIVE web-service" width="400" /></a></p>
<p>Opening the downloaded model in LIVE involved some additional unpacking and preparation (again, completely unattended):</p>
<p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b7c8ac212e970b-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="Loading into the LIVE viewer" height="225" src="/assets/image_919347.jpg" style="float: none; margin: 30px auto; display: block;" title="Loading into the LIVE viewer" width="400" /></a></p>
<p>At which point we have the model – with a helpful overlay for first-time users – inside the LIVE viewer, ready to go.</p>
<p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b8d235e105970c-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="Help overlay on LIVE" border="0" height="281" src="/assets/image_792119.jpg" style="background-image: none; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 30px auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="Help overlay on LIVE" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Dismissing the overlay, we can see the full building in all its glory.</p>
<p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b7c8ac213c970b-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="High level view of 210 King St E" border="0" height="281" src="/assets/image_962433.jpg" style="background-image: none; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 30px auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="High level view of 210 King St E" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Entering the building we immediately get a sense for the quality of the lighting and materials.</p>
<p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201bb094f1a43970d-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="Nice lighting and materials in the standard LIVE viewer" border="0" height="281" src="/assets/image_291615.jpg" style="background-image: none; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 30px auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="Nice lighting and materials in the standard LIVE viewer" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>The view outside is also well done. Opening the points of view we can see a number of vantage point that have been generated – presumably from the source Revit model.</p>
<p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b7c8ac2140970b-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="Very decent quality overall" border="0" height="281" src="/assets/image_833725.jpg" style="background-image: none; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 30px auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="Very decent quality overall" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>A number of these are obvious when we enter the 5th floor lobby.</p>
<p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201bb094f1a56970d-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="The lobby at 210 King St E" border="0" height="281" src="/assets/image_23585.jpg" style="background-image: none; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 30px auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="The lobby at 210 King St E" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Navigating through to oneof the cubicles, we can see the sensors on people’s desks.</p>
<p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b8d235e119970c-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="A view of a cubicle, with the various sensors" border="0" height="281" src="/assets/image_202407.jpg" style="background-image: none; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 30px auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="A view of a cubicle, with the various sensors" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>These all have BIM metadat associated – transferred through from the Revit file. Which raises all kinds of possibilities.</p>
<p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b8d235e121970c-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="You also have access to BIM metadata" border="0" height="281" src="/assets/image_3027.jpg" style="background-image: none; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 30px auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="You also have access to BIM metadata" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Now I was determined to try this model in VR, despite the LIVE viewer’s warning that the model was too large:</p>
<p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b8d235e12b970c-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="A warning that shouldn&#39;t be ignored" border="0" height="119" src="/assets/image_951684.jpg" style="background-image: none; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 30px auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="A warning that shouldn&#39;t be ignored" width="191" /></a></p>
<p>It worked, although the experience was a bit jittery. If I broke the model up into floors I have no doubt it’d be perfect. The VR experience is still in Beta with LIVE 1.1, of course.</p>
<p>You have a teleport controller that lets you move around – beyond the space you have to walk around in the room-scale experience.</p>

<p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201bb094f1a6a970d-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="Going down a corridor" border="0" height="281" src="/assets/image_912140.jpg" style="background-image: none; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 30px auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="Going down a corridor" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Here’s a quick look at me moving around the space using the teleport command. There’s also a “minimap” you can zoom out to, allowing you to zoom into a specific location really easily. I didn’t capture an image for that, though.</p>

<p>If you’re interested in trying Autodesk LIVE yourself, start by downloading the <a href="https://apps.autodesk.com/ACD/en/Detail/Index?id=4179124637618846903&amp;appLang=en&amp;os=Win64" target="_blank">LIVE viewer</a> and then some of the <a href="http://www.autodesk.com/live-samples" target="_blank">sample models</a>. You don’t need a VR headset, but it’s really cool if you have a Rift or Vive handy.</p>
