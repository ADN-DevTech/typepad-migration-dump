<p>I’ve just come back from 2 weeks off work. We didn’t go very far, but did enjoy the Swiss countryside, as well as the national day on August 1st.</p>

<p>Anyway, it’s back to the grindstone, with some looming deadlines around preparing content for AU 2023.</p>
<p>The class schedule is now live, so you can head on over and search for or browse your favourite classes. Be sure to bookmark any that interest you, as you’ll be able to register from August 24th.</p>
<p>Here are <a href="https://conferences.autodesk.com/flow/autodesk/au2023/sessioncatalog/page/inperson?search=kean" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the two classes I’ll be presenting</a> as primary speaker:</p>
<p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202b751ae7a1c200c-pi" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="My AU 2023 classes" border="0" height="416" src="/assets/image_615244.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="My AU 2023 classes" width="500" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://conferences.autodesk.com/flow/autodesk/au2023/sessioncatalog/page/inperson/session/1686766044586001Z9UY" rel="noopener" target="_blank">My first class</a> is bright and early on the Monday morning at 8am Pacific, and will be a 90-minute slot talking about <a href="https://keanw.com/VASA" rel="noopener" target="_blank">VASA</a>. <a href="https://conferences.autodesk.com/flow/autodesk/au2023/sessioncatalog/page/inperson/session/1686766247767001Zgix" rel="noopener" target="_blank">My second class</a> is on Wednesday afternoon at 2pm Pacific, and will be a shorter 60-minute session with my friend Pete Storey, where we’ll talk about printing and instrumenting bridges. Both sessions should be fun, I hope.</p>
<p>There’s also <a href="https://conferences.autodesk.com/flow/autodesk/au2023/sessioncatalog/page/inperson/session/1686766045082001Zqkj" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a panel session on the impact of acoustics in AEC</a> being run by my friend Allin Groom that I’m expecting to support in some capacity, and this is on the Monday at 1:30pm Pacific.</p>
<p>Besides these sessions, it seems quite likely we’ll be bringing a rather special experience to the AU Exhibit Hall, this year. It’s yet to be confirmed, but here are a couple of images that give some idea of what we’re hoping to do. I won’t say any more, for now, but we’re very excited about the possibility of running some extremely fun data capture activities at AU 2023.</p>

<p>All in all this AU is shaping up to be a very interesting – and probably slightly hectic – one. Watch this space to find out more as we prepare for Vegas!</p>
