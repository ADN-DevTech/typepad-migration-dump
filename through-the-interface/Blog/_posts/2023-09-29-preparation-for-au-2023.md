<p>It has been a really busy but important week for our team.</p>
<p>We had a fantastic virtual offsite where we spent a significant amount of time using LEGO to conceptualise some of our planning for the coming year. A friend of mine was all set to become a LEGO practitioner - to assist with team-building events - before the plans were de-railed by the pandemic… independently my colleague Dagmara suggested we try “Serious Play” for this offsite and I said yes before she’d finished her sentence.</p>

<p>We’ve made great strides for our upcoming exhibition in Toronto (formal announcement coming soon) which we’ll then be taking to AU 2023 in Las Vegas. This exhibit is going to be unbelievably cool - I can’t wait for people to see it.</p>
<p>Inspired by the recent DevCon in Munich, I’ve been working on a prototype integration of VASA into Forma. I’ll talk more about this in a series of posts, soon, but basically wanted to try urban pathfinding using context geometry from Forma - just to see whether VASA would work here - and ended up exploring a few different approaches, whether using Dynamo with STL output from Forma or directly using our WebAssembly package via Forma's Extension View SDK.</p>

<p>I really needed to finish it this week as Rhys and I are about to record our VASA class for AU, and I wanted to include this demo. I’m pleased with how it’s come together, and will certainly post more about how it was done soon.</p>
<p>But first - once the AU recording is over - I’m off to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinque_Terre" target="_blank">Cinque Terre</a> with my family for the coming week or so. I’ve never been and I’m very much looking forward to it. I’ll post some pictures once we’re back.</p>
