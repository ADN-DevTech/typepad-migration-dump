<p>The amazing Mike Lee – who has been doing a great job of driving the timeline project for <a href="https://dasher360.com" target="_blank">Dasher</a> – has used his sleuthing skills to figure out a way around <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2022/04/more-on-tandem-and-dasher.html" target="_blank">the bug affecting Intel-based Macs running Chrome v100 on Monterey</a>. He was about to submit a bug when he discovered <a href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1318724" target="_blank">this ticket filed against Chromium</a>, and a workaround buried within in. (Mike has since gone ahead and submitted <a href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1321476" target="_blank">his own report tracking this</a>.)</p><p>You need to go to <font face="Courier New">chrome://flags</font> and disable “<em>Use passthrough command decoder</em>”.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20282e153529e200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="473" height="375" title="Disabling the passthrough command decoder in Chrome" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Disabling the passthrough command decoder in Chrome" src="/assets/image_652819.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>After restarting Chrome and launching <a href="https://autode.sk/dasher-nest" target="_blank">Dasher</a>, you should now see the timeline is back.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202942fa87999200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="473" height="375" title="The timeline is back" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="The timeline is back" src="/assets/image_903112.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Not all Chromium-based browsers will have this flag exposed – Brave doesn’t appear to, for instance – but this gives me hope that we’ll be able to find a more sticky solution to this problem, in time. Great sleuthing, Mike!</p><p>I’m about to hop on a train to Geneva, this time to take a flight back to Paris and onwards to Atlanta for our annual (although virtual-only for the last two years) internal technical conference, TechX. I’ll be co-presenting a session about <a href="https://keanw.com/VASA" target="_blank">VASA</a> – a class I very much hope will be repeated at AU 2022, all being well. I’ll share more once I get to Atlanta.</p><p><strong><em>Update:</em></strong></p><p>The Chromium bug report was updated to highlight a more nuanced flag to enable to avoid this issue: if you search for “<em>Choose ANGLE graphics backend</em>” and set it to <em>Metal</em>, this should also work around the issue. This works for Chrome – and will also do so for Brave and Edge, I believe – but the good news is that the latest version of Brave (<code>Version 1.38.111 Chromium: 101.0.4951.54 (Official Build) (x86_64)</code>) already seems to be fixed. It’s based on the same Chromium version as the latest version of Chrome – 101.0.4951.54 – so it’s not at all clear why this is the case, but I’m taking it as progress.</p>
