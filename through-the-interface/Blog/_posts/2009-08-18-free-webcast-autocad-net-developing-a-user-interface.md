<p>Gopinath Taget, from DevTech Americas, will be delivering a repeat session of this free webcast on Thursday, August 20. Please go to our <a href="http://www.adskconsulting.com/adn/cs/api_course_sched.php">API training schedule</a> if you would like to register for the event (from where a recording of the previous event is also available <a href="http://download.autodesk.com/media/adn/AutoCAD.NETDevelopingUIWebcast_16Sept08.zip">for download (20.3 MB)</a>).</p>  <p>Here’s a brief synopsis of the webcast:</p>  <blockquote>   <p><em>This webcast will show how to integrate your application's user interface into the AutoCAD look and feel. We’ll show you how to work with .NET Forms, create your own palettes, issues surrounding .NET UI development on AutoCAD and implement Event handling so your interface can respond to actions initiated by the user. We will also talk about freely available .NET controls that the AutoCAD .NET API provides and how to use them.</em></p> </blockquote>  <p>Gopi tells me the content is focused on WinForms: if you are looking to integrate WPF into your UI then the information in <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2009/08/hosting-wpf-content-inside-an-autocad-palette.html">this recent post</a> should be of help.</p>
