<p>I was hoping to post during the week from Las Vegas, but it didn’t end up happening. My time just bled away between the various classes I recorded/ presented/co-paneled and the time spent catching up with old friends and making new ones – mainly from among the various people who took the chance to provide greatly appreciated feedback regarding this blog.</p>
<p>All in all it was a great week – as it always is – but it wasn’t all smooth sailing: my AU Virtual session on our Plugins of the Month – which I’d <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2010/11/at-au-2010.html" target="_blank">struggled to get into Vegas to record</a> – was among many that were plagued by technical problems. I have a sneaking suspicion that my sessions didn’t end up having anyone successfully connect to for the full duration – whether you were able to or not, I’d appreciate hearing your comments on the experience. And please accept my sincere apologies for any inconvenience: while outside my control, I do feel very bad for anyone who wasted time on this. I have no doubt that next year will be much better, but in the meantime I’m going to look into the “on demand” experience and see whether it’s worth me posting a repeat session recorded using Camtasia.</p>
<p>The physical classes all went much better, thankfully. I haven’t seen the feedback, as yet, but I certain got the impression that many of the people in the room for both my classes (“<em><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2010/11/au-2010-handout-integrate-f-into-your-c-or-vbnet-application-for-an-8x-performance-boost.html" target="_blank">CP322-2 - Integrate F# into Your C# or VB.NET Application for an 8x Performance Boost</a>”</em> and “<em><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2010/11/au-2010-handout-point-clouds-on-a-shoestring.html" target="_blank">AC427-4 - Point Clouds on a Shoestring</a></em>”) seemed to find them valuable. And big thanks to our friends at <a href="http://eye.fi" target="_blank">Eye-Fi</a> for providing two <a href="http://www.eye.fi/products/connectx2" target="_blank">Connect X2</a> and two <a href="http://www.eye.fi/products/prox2" target="_blank">Pro X2</a> cards as competition prizes.</p>
<p>One of the highlights of the event for me was seeing and getting to play around with the upcoming version of <a href="http://labs.autodesk.com/utilities/photo_scene_editor/" target="_blank">Photo Scene Editor</a> (codenamed Caipi). The development team has integrated some incredible meshing technology which is going to be revolutionary: many people in the industry have been struggling to get this kind of capability via convoluted routes, and this will make it <em>really</em> easy.</p>
<p>As an example, here’s another “capture” of my head, this time taken from just 15 images. I used this example in my class to demonstrate some of the inherent issues with capturing shiny/reflective surfaces ;-), but I know the results would have been better if we’d added a few overhead shots.</p>
<p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2013489b69544970c-pi"><img alt="Kean&#39;s head in Caipi" border="0" height="463" src="/assets/image_621636.jpg" style="margin: 20px auto; display: block; float: none; border-width: 0px;" title="Kean&#39;s head in Caipi" width="464" /></a></p>
<p>It should be noted that this is not a visualization created using splats: this is a properly textured mesh! Turning off the textures displays the underlying mesh:</p>
<p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2013489b695c1970c-pi"><img alt="Meshed head" border="0" height="463" src="/assets/image_999873.jpg" style="margin: 20px auto; display: block; float: none; border-width: 0px;" title="Meshed head" width="464" /></a></p>
<p>You’ll be able to export the mesh as OBJ, DWG, DWF, FBX and a number of other formats.</p>
<p>Once you have a mesh, the sky’s the limit: while I was in the AU exhibit hall members of the Labs team were working to make a mesh watertight so it could be 3D-printed. Fantastic stuff.</p>
<p>This version of Photo Scene Editor is likely to be posted in a few months: I’ll certainly report back when it’s available.</p>
