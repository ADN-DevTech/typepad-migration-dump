The weather wasn’t particularly good by Polynesian standards (it was just fine by Swiss standards ;-) but we still got the chance to see a fair amount of the island.</p><p>We stopped for lunch at a popular surf spot, which also had black sand beaches.</p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b8d2b33995970c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Surfers in and out of the sea" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Surfers in and out of the sea" src="/assets/image_828155.jpg" border="0"></a><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b7c928cea0970b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="The boys watching surfers" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="The boys watching surfers" src="/assets/image_601856.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>From there we headed on south-east onto the smaller part of the island – known as Tahiti Iti or Tai'arapū – where we drove up towards Belvedere for a view out across the larger part (Tahiti Nui).</p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201bb09cbf344970d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="The view across to Tahiti Nui" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="The view across to Tahiti Nui" src="/assets/image_135866.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Coming up here got us out from the bank of cloud over the main part of the island, which was nice.</p><p>We had hoped to use our remaining time to get across to one of the atolls in French Polynesia – ideally <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fakarava" target="_blank">Fakarava</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rangiroa" target="_blank">Rangiroa</a>, as they apparently have spectacular diving – but in the end we opted to take the 45-minute ferry across to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mo%27orea" target="_blank">Mo’orea</a>, instead. (Anokhi still had a slight fever and we didn’t want to risk getting stranded away from medical facilities.)</p><p>So it was that on Sunday we headed down to the port in Tahiti to take the ferry.</p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b7c928cec2970b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="A ferry for Moorea" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="A ferry for Moorea" src="/assets/image_57748.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201bb09cbf362970d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Arriving in Moorea" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Arriving in Moorea" src="/assets/image_776435.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>As everything had been so up in the air, we took our chances on the car rental front: we ended up having to take a 7-seater Dacia Lodgy, which was fine if a bit bigger than we needed. Our Airbnb was spectacular, though: we found out about it through Cyril, one of our hosts on Tahiti, who is good friends with the owner. It has a pool and an outdoor kitchen!</p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201bb09cbf374970d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Our Airbnb on Moorea" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Our Airbnb on Moorea" src="/assets/image_25892.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>On Sunday I took it easy with the younger kids, getting settled in. My wife and eldest child (Kalan) headed out to try and book some diving: they headed around the island to the Intercontinental but had a bad experience trying to book anything (the dive center there was short-staffed due to illness, and the reception they received was just plain rude, so we’ve given up completely on them).</p><p>On Monday we headed out for adventure as a family: we started by booking diving with <a href="http://www.mooreabluediving.com/" target="_blank">Moorea Blue Diving</a> – my wife and I will each take a turn to dive with Kalan on Tuesday and Wednesday. From there we headed around the island, going inland to follow the “pineapple route”…</p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b7c928cefa970b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="A drive along the pineapple route" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="A drive along the pineapple route" src="/assets/image_904515.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b8d2b339d4970c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="And this is why it's called that" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="And this is why it's called that" src="/assets/image_747900.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>… and to climb Mo’orea’s own Belvedere:</p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201bb09cbf3ae970d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Checking out the view" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Checking out the view" src="/assets/image_706710.jpg" border="0"></a><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201bb09cbf3c3970d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="165" title="The view from Belvedere" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="The view from Belvedere" src="/assets/image_379420.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Then we headed around to Coco Beach, from where we rented a little motorboat to visit the “motus” – three little islands off the shore. (One is private and so was off-limits.)</p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201bb09cbf3cf970d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="On the boat" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="On the boat" src="/assets/image_548254.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>We stopped once to snorkel with rays – this was spectacular, in itself – and then worked our way back into the wind to moor once again.</p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b8d2b339f2970c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="161" title="Gorgeous" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Gorgeous" src="/assets/image_289273.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>At this second point – in just a metre and a half of water – we swam with rays, once again, but also with black-tip reef sharks: 5 of each at a time! (There may have been more – this was the most we saw at any particular moment.)</p><p>Kalan was over the moon: it’s his dream to become a marine biologist, so this was just heaven for him.</p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b8d2b339f9970c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Kalan celebrating" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Kalan celebrating" src="/assets/image_641207.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>So our first day on Mo’orea went very well. We’re now looking forward to seeing what the diving has to offer!</p><p><em>By the way… if you’ve enjoyed these photos, you can see more (and more regularly) via </em><a href="http://instagram.com/monde_en_poche"><em>our Instagram page</em></a><em>.</em></p>
