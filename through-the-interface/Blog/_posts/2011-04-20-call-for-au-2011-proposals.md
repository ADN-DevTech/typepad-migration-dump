<p>I’m a bit late announcing this, but as I’m due to submit my own <a href="http://autodesk.com/aucfp" target="_blank">proposals for Autodesk University 2011</a> by the <strong>May 6th deadline</strong>, I thought I’d post a quick note to remind readers of the fast-closing window of opportunity to submit your own proposals to speak at this year’s AU.</p>
<p>I’m definitely submitting a session showing how to integrate AutoCAD with Kinect (please don’t go stealing my idea, now ;-), and I’m chewing on another topic, which may prove to be “choosing the right programming language for working with AutoCAD”.</p>
<p>I’m still open to delivering additional sessions, in case anyone has suggestions for topics they’d like to see me present. If you have a suggestion – hopefully based on material I’ve already posted on my blog – please post a comment or <a href="mailto:kean.walmsley@autodesk.com?subject=AU suggestion:" target="_blank">drop me an email</a>.</p>
<p>On a side note… while looking for an image for this post – something I do very rarely, but I was feeling whimsical – I stumbled across <a href="http://geekandpoke.typepad.com/geekandpoke/2011/01/geeks-proposals.html" target="_blank">this cartoon</a> (which is slightly off-topic but well worth sharing):</p>
