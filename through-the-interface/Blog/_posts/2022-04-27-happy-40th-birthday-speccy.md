<p>On Saturday the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX_Spectrum" target="_blank">ZX Spectrum</a> turned 40. Does that make anyone else feel old?</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202788079f75b200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="353" title="ZX Spectrum advert" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="ZX Spectrum advert" src="/assets/image_162149.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>When first released on April 23rd, 1982, Sinclair Research’s ZX Spectrum had 16K of RAM, a horrible rubber keyboard and some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attribute_clash" target="_blank">very quirky colour graphics</a>. In fairness, though, it was a quantum leap (another <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinclair_QL" target="_blank">Sinclair reference</a> for the astute observer) beyond the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX81" target="_blank">ZX81</a>, which had – unexpanded – just 1K of RAM, a truly grotesque membrane keyboard and low-res black and white graphics.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202788079f78d200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="367" title="ZX Spectrum 48k" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="ZX Spectrum 48k" src="/assets/image_806143.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Both of these devices changed the world: the Spectrum went on to become the UK’s best-selling microcomputer, launching an industry and many, many software careers (mine included).</p><p>Prior to owning a ZX Spectrum (mine was a plus, which at least had a proper keyboard), I borrowed computer time from my Dad’s TRS-80 Model III and from one of our school’s BBC Micro Model B. The Spectrum was the first computer the kids in our family (which mainly meant me) had nearly unrestricted access to, and it was a game-changer.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20282e15288b1200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="295" title="ZX Spectrum +" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="ZX Spectrum +" src="/assets/image_705795.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>We didn’t have much by way of peripherals – neither the smudge-tastic thermal printer nor the microdrive – but we did have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currah" target="_blank">Currah Speech</a> module, which caused us a fair amount of amusement. (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Okwiseguy.ogg" target="_blank">Listen to this</a> to get the idea.)</p><p>We loaded games from cassette. Most were copies and were highly finicky to load: we had a few different cassette players that we’d switch between depending on which happened to load a particular game better. There was nothing more frustrating than spending several minutes biting your nails during the loading of a large game, only to receive the dreaded <a href="https://shred.zone/cilla/page/441/r-tape-loading-error-part-2.html" target="_blank">R Tape Loading error</a> message.</p><p>For those wanting to relive the experience of loading games on the Spectrum, I do have a few posts for you.</p><p>About a decade ago – back when the Speccy was only 30! – I had some fun <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2012/10/my-new-zx-spectrum.html" target="_blank">getting one working with a modern TV</a> and <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2012/12/loading-games-on-my-zx-spectrum-from-an-ipod-photo.html" target="_blank">loading games from an iPod Photo</a>. More recently – during <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMPZ0Qz6RKGpOJuHbVY5aVYQntaDEMXZp" target="_blank">my confinement-driven Floppy Friday series</a> – I dedicated <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2021/09/floppy-friday-48.html" target="_blank">episode 48</a> to loading games onto the Spectrum via an audio player on my Mac.</p><p align="center"><br></p><p align="center"><iframe width="500" height="283" title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pqJryJztJJk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"></iframe></p><p><br></p><p>I’m happy to say that the Spectrum community is still going strong. Some time ago I backed <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/spectrumnext/zx-spectrum-next-issue-2" target="_blank">the Kickstarter for issue 2 of the Spectrum Next</a>, which will hopefully be built and delivered before too much longer.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202788079f76b200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="281" title="ZX Spectrum Next" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="ZX Spectrum Next" src="/assets/image_567906.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Here’s to 40 more years of the Speccy!</p>
