<p>There’s a fun virtual event happening at the end of September, the <a href="https://aps.autodesk.com/blog/redefine-future-autodesk-design-make-eduhack" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Autodesk Design &amp; Make EduHack</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202c8d3b3a999200c-pi" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" height="562" src="/assets/image_676326.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="EduHack" width="998" /></a></p>
<p>It’s for students who know some programming - whether studying Computer Science or another STEM discipline - and would like to get connected with Autodesk and learn how to use Autodesk Platform Services. The event is fully virtual - participants will use tools such as Zoom and Slack to communicate about their projects - and should be a great way to meet folks at Autodesk and accelerate skill development.</p>
<p>The hacking will take place from September 27-29, 2024, and the after a day of deliberation on September 30 the judges will announce the winners on October 1.</p>
<p>Here’s the list of challenges for the hack (you can find more details in the blog post linked above):</p>
<ul>
<li>Rise of the Machines: Byte Back</li>
<li>Inception of Intelligence: Dreaming in Data</li>
<li>Hack the Planet!</li>
<li>Ctrl+Alt+Delete: Dungeon Challenge</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the judging criteria:</p>

<li>Elegance</li>
<li>Business problem solved</li>
<li>Progress made during the weekend</li>
<li>Depth of Autodesk API use</li>
<li>Wow factor</li>
</ul>
<p>Prizes will be given to winners to the tune of around $300 (some cool hard cash and some Autodesk swag) in addition to the intangibles (glory, bragging rights, etc.).</p>
