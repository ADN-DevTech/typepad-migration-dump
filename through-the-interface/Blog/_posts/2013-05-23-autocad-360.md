We’ve also taken the opportunity to roll out a true <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freemium" target="_blank">freemium</a> offering, whereby the basic, free capabilities are complemented by “Pro” and “Pro Plus” mobile plans. Here’s <a href="https://www.autocad360.com/mobileplans" target="_blank">a comparison of the offerings</a>, in case you’re interested, as well as <a href="https://www.autocad360.com/gopro" target="_blank">12 reasons to go with a Pro plan</a>.</p>  <p>The “Pro Plus” branding takes me back to my student days in the UK, where <a href="http://www.proplus.co.uk" target="_blank">caffeine pills of the same name</a> were often used by those needing to pull all-nighters (most typically to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cramming_(education)" target="_blank">cram</a> for exams). I didn’t personally use them for that, but I do remember taking some to get through a 24-hour <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_Peaks" target="_blank">Twin Peaks</a> marathon at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Charles_Cinema" target="_blank">the Prince Charles Cinema</a>, which is just off <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leicester_Square" target="_blank">Leicester Square</a>. Ah, the memories.</p>  <p>Anyway, back to the topic at hand. I’m really only a casual user of the former AutoCAD WS tools, and so while I won’t go into detail on the updates that have been made to them I will talk a little about the new web app.</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20192aa38e405970d-pi" target="_blank"><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 20px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="My first AutoCAD 360 drawing" border="0" alt="My first AutoCAD 360 drawing" src="/assets/image_87371.jpg" width="450" height="331" /></a></p>  <p>The AutoCAD 360 web app is a ground-up re-write of the former Flash-based AutoCAD WS web client, for which we’ve now made the transition across to HTML5 and JavaScript.</p>  <p>Here’s something to try… if you view the HTML source of a drawing you open using AutoCAD 360, you’ll see some very interesting script references in the body of the page, such as <a href="https://app.autocad360.com/html5proj/jsapi/Editor.js" target="_blank">this one</a>. What’s particularly interesting is the commonality between the JavaScript files referred to from the AutoCAD 360 web app and <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2013/04/under-the-hood-autocads-javascript-api.html" target="_blank">the Shaping Layer introduced in AutoCAD 2014</a>.</p>  <p>That’s not to say that the contents of these files are currently identical – without knowing specifics, I can well imagine that forks were made in order to get AutoCAD 360 working effectively for its initial Beta release – but you can hopefully see the intention for this layer to be common (and it’s my expectation that over time it will become so).</p>  <p>Which certainly raises the interesting – albeit still very much future – possibility of being able to write apps targeting AutoCAD’s JavaScript API that can share code (and are perhaps even identical?) across the two platforms.</p>  <p>I’ll certainly be sharing more on any extensibility model that we make available for the web app (whose project name was “Corona” – something else you’ll be able to glean from looking at the HTML source), in due course. Hopefully this at least presents a somewhat more concrete example of the direction we’re intending for this API technology and its future promise. Interesting times!</p>
