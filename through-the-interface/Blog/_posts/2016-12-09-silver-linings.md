<p>It turns there is a downside to choosing a small airline based in a small airport. My happiness at discovering both the Bern airport and the airline flying out of it was considerably lessened when my flight home was cancelled without explanation, last night.</p> <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b8d244503e970c-pi" target="_blank"><img title="Just like that it was cancelled" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 30px auto; border-left: 0px; display: block; padding-right: 0px" border="0" alt="Just like that it was cancelled" src="/assets/image_566391.jpg" width="500" height="326"></a></p> <p>After much shared confusion with my fellow travellers, I ended up being offered a room in airport hotel and an 8am flight out today. So it was that I got back on the phone with Peter Schlipf and ended up joining the Forge Accelerator attendees for one last dinner at Fugazi No. 15.</p> <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b7c8ba94ed970b-pi" target="_blank"><img title="Fugazi No. 15" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 30px auto; border-left: 0px; display: block; padding-right: 0px" border="0" alt="Fugazi No. 15" src="/assets/image_11730.jpg" width="500" height="281"></a></p> <p>After the initial frustration, it ended up being a really fun evening. A photographic highlight for me was getting a snap of two Autodesk T-shirts, one from circa 1990 and the other from 2016. Many thanks to Per Voss from NTI CAD Center for sporting such rare merchandise.</p> <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b8d2445050970c-pi" target="_blank"><img title="Autodesk T-shirts through the ages" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 30px auto; border-left: 0px; display: block; padding-right: 0px" border="0" alt="Autodesk T-shirts through the ages" src="/assets/image_122530.jpg" width="500" height="281"></a></p> <p>Here’s a quick snap of the whole gang… at least all those who chose to come out on the last night of the Accelerator, anyway.</p> <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b7c8ba94f9970b-pi" target="_blank"><img title="The Acceleratees" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 30px auto; border-left: 0px; display: block; padding-right: 0px" border="0" alt="The Acceleratees" src="/assets/image_68828.jpg" width="500" height="281"></a></p>     <p>After we were done I headed back to the airport hotel – arriving there at around 1am – before heading to the airport at 7am for my flight home.</p> <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b7c8ba94fe970b-pi" target="_blank"><img title="Arriving home" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 30px auto; border-left: 0px; display: block; padding-right: 0px" border="0" alt="Arriving home" src="/assets/image_560254.jpg" width="500" height="281"></a></p> <p>Many thanks to all the Forge Accelerator attendees for helping make it such a good week. As I <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2016/12/hololens-and-forge-at-the-munich-accelerator.html" target="_blank">mentioned yesterday</a>, we had our ups and downs, but I’m pretty sure people found the event worthwhile.</p> <p>Tonight I’m heading out to the Autodesk Switzerland Christmas Party. As it’s a nautical theme I’m dressing as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_Haddock" target="_blank">Captain Haddock</a> from Tintin, which should be good for a laugh or two.</p>
