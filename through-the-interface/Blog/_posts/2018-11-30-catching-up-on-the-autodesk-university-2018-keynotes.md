<p>Among other things, this week, I’ve been trying to kick-off my AU2018 catch-up viewing. So far I’ve just had the chance to fill in the keynotes that I missed, so I thought I’d collect those that I could find together for others to view.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad3a42a49200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="274" title="AU's favourite DJ" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="AU's favourite DJ" src="/assets/image_961195.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>The first keynote of the Monday’s pre-conference events was that of Connect &amp; Construct:</p><p align="center"><br></p><p align="center"><iframe width="500" height="283" src="https://player.ooyala.com/static/v4/candidate/latest/skin-plugin/iframe.html?ec=M5a3htZzE6IiLeAPQ9IxaFXL5mCE6qTQ&amp;pbid=e7917642de4a4f1eae0a331375e03784&amp;pcode=o3OG46qoFLfL76WkTkb1a9k23qBd" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p align="center"><br></p><p>Next up was that of the <a href="https://forge.autodesk.com/devcon-2018" target="_blank">Forge DevCon</a>. Very strangely (for me, anyway) I couldn’t attend this one in person, as I was <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2018/11/au-2018-class-recordings-are-now-online.html" target="_blank">presenting a Connect &amp; Construct session at the same time</a>.</p><p align="center"><br></p><p align="center"><iframe width="500" height="283" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lNlG00ZVUyI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"></iframe></p><p align="center"><br></p><p>Of the main AU event, there was, of course, the opening keynote:</p><p align="center"><br></p><p align="center"><iframe width="500" height="283" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pgDTndsVzqY" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"></iframe></p><p align="center"><br></p><p>The next I attended was the AEC industry keynote, for which the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/AutodeskUniversity/videos/aec-keynote-autodesk-university-2018/268326610703832/" target="_blank">only recording I could track down is on Facebook</a>.</p><p>One keynote I wish I’d managed to attend in person was probably my favourite of the whole event: the Product Design &amp; Manufacturing keynote. Excellent content and perfectly executed.</p><p align="center"><br></p><p align="center">
