<p>This post is a bit of a grab-bag of various event-related topics.</p><p>The first one (chronologically, if not in terms of the title above) is the availability of session recordings from the <strong>recent CanBIM event</strong>: “<a href="https://www.bigmarker.com/series/calgary20/series_details?bmid=97c4288d926f" target="_blank">The Future of Work: Designing Resiliency and Building Work Safety Post-COVID</a>”.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20263e953636a200b-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="CanBIM" border="0" height="211" src="/assets/image_910056.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="CanBIM" width="500" /></a></p><p>My own session was entitled “<a href="https://www.bigmarker.com/canbim/Using-Generative-Design-and-Digital-Twins-to-Improve-Occupant-Well-Being" target="_blank">Using Generative Design and Digital Twins to Improve Occupant Well Being</a>”.</p><p>As it was the first session of the day – with a new web streaming platform – there were a few teething issues for the sponsor’s introduction (and the session auto-closed a little too promptly, which meant no Q&amp;A at the end). My piece runs from around the 18 minute mark through to the end (at 50 minutes). Oh, and it seems there’s a charge of $5 CAD to stream the recorded session – I hope you don’t regret the expense if you choose to pay it. Many thanks to Dan Doherty for inviting me to present, to Laurie Elliott from RAND/IMAGINiT for introducing me, and to Tina Seifert and Curtis Baanee for providing support throughout.</p><p>The second topic is a heads-up for people regarding the <strong>online AEC Hackathon</strong> that kicks off next week. It’s <a href="https://hackaec.com" target="_blank">running from July 6th through to July 26th</a>, and I’ll be <a href="https://hackaec.com/#presentations" target="_blank">presenting a session</a> on Dasher on July 21st (I’m out on vacation until the 17th, so this will give me some time to prepare it once I’m back ;-).</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20263ec25103b200c-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="AEC Hackathon" border="0" height="250" src="/assets/image_215265.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="AEC Hackathon" width="250" /></a></p><p>For more information on the Hackathon I suggest checking out <a href="https://forge.autodesk.com/blog/join-us-upcoming-aec-hackathon-online" target="_blank">Jaime’s post over on the Forge blog</a>.</p><p>The third topic relates to <strong>Autodesk University 2020</strong>, which is <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2020/05/autodesk-university-goes-fully-digital-in-2020.html" target="_blank">online for this year</a>. I went back and forth on <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2020/06/the-autodesk-university-2020-proposal-deadline-is-coming-fast.html" target="_blank">what classes to submit</a> for this year’s event, and given some uncertainty related to the work we’re doing on post-COVID return to the workplace (welcome to Research!) I decided only to submit a class on Project Dasher. It’s called <em>“Lessons from Project Dasher: Building a Digital Twin using Forge”</em> which should be fairly self-explanatory. I’m hopeful that we’ll have some really cool stuff to share, this year, but then I thought the same for last year (and things didn’t pan out quite as I’d hoped). There are already useful things to share, either way, so I felt this was the least uncertain path to take.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20263ec250f98200c-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="Voting is open" border="0" height="388" src="/assets/image_230806.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="Voting is open" width="500" /></a></p><p>Anyway, the <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/autodesk-university/conference/call-for-proposals/voting" target="_blank">voting is now live for AU classes</a>, so do go across there and share your thoughts. (I don’t see my own class listed, as yet, so this is more about sharing general feedback.)</p><p>One last topic… I’ve also been asked to talk at my first in-person event since February – <a href="http://sdsc-connect.ch/" target="_blank">Enhancing discovery and creativity with AI</a>, organised by the <strong>Swiss Data Science Center</strong> - which is taking place in Zurich on October 1st. Assuming the health situation doesn’t change between now and then (which it may well – we’ll see).</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20263ec251032200c-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="Data Science event" border="0" height="639" src="/assets/image_621924.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="Data Science event" width="454" /></a></p><p>It’ll be interesting (and possibly a little scary) to be in the same physical space with people, once again – something I didn’t really expect to happen until sometime next year – but I’m sure it’ll be fun. I’ve been asked to talk about a project done elsewhere in Autodesk Research – <a href="https://www.starck.com/a-i-introducing-the-first-chair-created-with-artificial-intelligence-p3801" target="_blank">the A.I. chair design in conjunction with Philippe Starck and Kartell</a> – which is already a bit of a departure from my usual topics.</p>
