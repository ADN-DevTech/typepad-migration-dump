<p>I <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2022/03/forge-data-days-coming-to-a-city-near-you.html" target="_blank">talked recently</a> about <a href="https://forge.autodesk.com/blog/announcing-forge-data-days-global-event-series" target="_blank">the first in-person event tour</a> that’s been held for Forge developers in at least a few years, this time focused on the new Forge Data offering (including the <a href="https://forge.autodesk.com/blog/data-exchange-released-forge-data-exchange-apis-now-available-public-beta" target="_blank">Data Exchange API that’s now in public beta</a>).</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202942faca6c4200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="203" title="Forge Data days banner" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Forge Data days banner" src="/assets/image_604784.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>At the time I wasn’t sure which event I’d attend: there’s an in-person (finally!) <a href="https://forge.autodesk.com/accelerator-program" target="_blank">Forge Accelerator</a> next to the Barcelona event, which made that one especially interesting, for instance.</p><p>In the end the timing for the Munich event worked best. I’ve now booked my hotel and bus ticket, and I’ll be there for the first event in the global tour in Munich next <strong>Tuesday, May 31st 2022</strong>. There’s still time to sign up, but don’t delay.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20278807ef270200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="125" title="Munich Forge Data Day" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Munich Forge Data Day" src="/assets/image_592387.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>The agenda has some introductory content to kick things off, so if you’re already working with Forge then you can plan on getting there for 11am. (This will make it feasible for people coming in on the day itself from neighbouring countries, for instance.) The event will be in English, too, in case that’s important information for you.</p><p>Hoping to see you next Tuesday!</p>
