<p>Another first for my team... a few months prior to a new release of our various products we typically travel the world to tell ADN members about the new product and API features these products will (probably) contain. This year we presented to upwards of 1400 people in 21 cities around the world. Due to the early nature of the information the events on this tour are only open to ADN members and people who have signed a non-disclosure agreement.</p> <p>This year, we've decided also to present many of the DevDays tour sessions online - <strong><em>at no cost</em></strong> - to allow people who missed the tour to attend, but also to allow people not under non-disclosure to get access to the information once we're able to deliver it publicly.</p> <p>If you're interested in understanding the application migration issues or seeing the new API features coming in the next releases of our products, sign up for one or more of these webcasts (information on doing so is provided at the bottom of this post):</p> <p><strong>Developer Days Online – AutoCAD®</strong><br><em>Description:</em> The 2010 release of AutoCAD APIs<br><em>Date:</em> February 10, 2009<br><em>Start:</em> 4pm GMT; 5pm CET; 8am PDT; 11am EST<br><em>Duration:</em> 2 hours<br><em>Location:</em> Virtual – by Microsoft LiveMeeting and Conference Call</p> <p><strong>Developer Days Online – AEC </strong><br><em>Description:</em> The 2010 release of Revit®, AutoCAD® Architecture and AutoCAD® MEP APIs<br><em>Date:</em> February 12, 2009<br><em>Start:</em> 4pm GMT; 5pm CET; 8am PDT; 11am EST<br><em>Duration:</em> 2 hours<br><em>Location:</em> Virtual – by Microsoft LiveMeeting and Conference Call</p> <p><strong>Developer Days Online – Geospatial</strong><br><em>Description:</em> The 2010 release of AutoCAD® Map 3D and Autodesk MapGuide® Enterprise APIs<br><em>Date:</em> February 17, 2009<br><em>Start:</em> 4pm GMT; 5pm CET; 8am PDT; 11am EST<br><em>Duration:</em> 2 hours<br><em>Location:</em> Virtual – by Microsoft LiveMeeting and Conference Call</p> <p><strong>Developer Days Online – Manufacturing</strong><br><em>Description:</em> The 2010 release of Autodesk® Inventor® and AutoCAD® Mechanical APIs<br><em>Date:</em> February 24, 2009<br><em>Start:</em> 4pm GMT; 5pm CET; 8am PDT; 11am EST<br><em>Duration:</em> 2 hours<br><em>Location:</em> Virtual – by Microsoft LiveMeeting and Conference Call</p> <p><strong>Developer Days Online – Civil 3D</strong><br><em>Description:</em> The 2010 release of AutoCAD® Civil 3D® APIs<br><em>Date:</em> February 19, 2009<br><em>Start:</em> 4pm GMT; 5pm CET; 8am PDT; 11am EST<br><em>Duration:</em> 2 hours<br><em>Location:</em> Virtual – by Microsoft LiveMeeting and Conference Call<br></p> <p>To register to attend any of these online events, <a href="mailto:adn-training-worldwide@autodesk.com">send us an e-mail</a> stating which session(s) you wish to attend and we will reply with the LiveMeeting and Conference Call details.</p>
