<p>Our first daughter, Anokhi, was born yesterday evening at 22:46 CET, weighing 3.38 kg and measuring 47.5 cm in length. Her older brothers Kalan and <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2006/09/a_quick_announc.html">Zephyr</a> were thrilled to meet her today.</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2011570529fc7970c-pi"><img style="border-right-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" title="Little Anokhi" border="0" alt="Little Anokhi" src="/assets/image_710026.jpg" width="476" height="334" /></a> </p>  <p>I’ll be on vacation properly from next week - spending time with our newly super-sized family - but will probably manage to squeeze in another post or two before mother and baby get home from the hospital.</p>
