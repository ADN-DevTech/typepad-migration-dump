<p>I was asked recently by <a href="https://twitter.com/BillDebevc" target="_blank">Bill Debevc</a> to talk about <a href="http://dasher360.com/" target="_blank">Dasher 360</a> during an interview for the BIM Thoughts podcast series. It was certainly fun chatting about the project with Bill.</p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b7c8fd659d970b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="500" title="BIM Thoughts" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="BIM Thoughts" src="/assets/image_904884.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>I’m happy to see that the <a href="http://bimthoughts.com/e81/" target="_blank">podcast is now live on the BIM Thoughts site</a>.
