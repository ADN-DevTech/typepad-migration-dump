<p>It seems that the approach for accessing the "_name" property - a hidden property often populated with interesting information about DWF and DWFx objects by our design applications - changed between Autodesk Design Review 2008 and 2009. The approach needed in ADR 2009 has now been demonstrated in a sample provided with <a href="http://dwf.blogs.com/beyond_the_paper/2009/01/access-the-hidden-property-_name.html">this post on Volker's Beyond the Paper blog</a>.</p>
