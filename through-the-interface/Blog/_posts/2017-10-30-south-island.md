<p>As much as I hate compressing so much into a single post, I don’t see any other option if I’m to bring you all up-to-date. So please accept my apologies for not doing justice to New Zealand’s absolutely incredible south island. In this post we’ll talk about the first part of the journey through the south island, from Picton to Christchurch. I’ll cover the journey from Christchurch to Queenstown in the next post. Here’s a quick view of our journey southwards, for context.</p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b8d2b94957970c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="472" height="500" title="The path southwards" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="The path southwards" src="/assets/image_417022.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Our adventure on the south island started the Saturday before last. We took the 2.45pm Interislander ferry across from Wellington to Picton, which was thankfully very calm (a couple of members of the family suffer badly from seasickness, so this was a genuine concern… especially as Cook Strait is known for its roughness).</p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b7c92eda07970b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Our ferry across to Picton" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Our ferry across to Picton" src="/assets/image_747054.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b7c92eda0b970b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Cook Strait" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Cook Strait" src="/assets/image_831969.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>We stayed the night at the nearest campsite to the ferry – literally just 1km away – and started our trip across to the west of the south island around mid-morning. We got as far as <a href="http://berlins.co.nz/" target="_blank">Berlin’s Cafe and Bar</a>. We had a very warm welcome, there, and took the oportunity to walk down by the river and – after dark – explore a local (and basically unknown) glowworm habitat.</p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b7c92eda0f970b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Buller gorge" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Buller gorge" src="/assets/image_909757.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201bb09d200db970d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="A nice rainbow" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="A nice rainbow" src="/assets/image_928969.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b7c92eda17970b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="500" title="Glowworm threads" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Glowworm threads" src="/assets/image_751972.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>The next day we started off with a stop at Westport, to see the seal colony. Here’s a photo, but you’d be hard-pressed to pick out the seals (they were more visible with the human eye).</p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b8d2b94873970c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="The Westport seal colony" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="The Westport seal colony" src="/assets/image_684028.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b8d2b94878970c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="A long way from home" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="A long way from home" src="/assets/image_691813.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>We then drove further down the west coast to Punakaiki, to see the pancake rocks and get sprayed by blowholes. Timing is very important for this: our host in Berlin told us when the next high-tide was due (1:40pm on Monday) and we got there within 30 minutes of that time. It was raining, on and off, and we did end up a little soggy.</p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201bb09d200e4970d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Pancake rocks at Punakaiki" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Pancake rocks at Punakaiki" src="/assets/image_562447.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201bb09d200ec970d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Some stunning views" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Some stunning views" src="/assets/image_17398.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b8d2b94884970c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Incredible" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Incredible" src="/assets/image_31391.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b8d2b9488c970c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Impressive" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Impressive" src="/assets/image_387391.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b8d2b94890970c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Wet" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Wet" src="/assets/image_911693.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>We’d been planning on “freedom camping” for that night, but given how wet and cold we were we decided to opt for a powered site, after all. This turned out to be in the aptly named Greymouth. Although given its name I was expecting it to be a little more colourful than it turned out to be (ouch). But the campsite was great: bare-bones but relaxed and inexpensive.</p><p>By this point we’d had enough of getting wet, although in fairness it was only for about a day and a half. In Rotorua someone had told me that if you’re getting rain on one coast of the south island, just switch across to the other side. We’d been planning on getting across there, anyway – and would have gone down the east coast from the beginning if the roads around Kaikoura hadn’t still been closed due to earthquake damage – we just did it a bit more quickly than we’d expected.</p><p>We headed through Arthur’s Pass – which was jaw-droppingly beautiful – to get to Christchurch, stopping off to visit the awesome limestone boulders at Castle Hill. As soon as we entered Arthur’s Pass the skies cleared. It was just what we needed.</p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201bb09d200f8970d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Towards Arthur's Pass" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Towards Arthur's Pass" src="/assets/image_561493.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201bb09d20101970d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="119" title="Wow" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Wow" src="/assets/image_821201.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b8d2b94898970c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Heading towards the boulders" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Heading towards the boulders" src="/assets/image_791909.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b8d2b948a0970c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Zephyr at Castle Hill" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Zephyr at Castle Hill" src="/assets/image_927335.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b8d2b948a4970c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Nice reflections" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Nice reflections" src="/assets/image_948485.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b7c92eda2d970b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="189" title="Breathtaking" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Breathtaking" src="/assets/image_140243.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>In Christchurch we caught up with an old friend of mine from university in the UK who had emigrated here with his wife 6 or so years ago. A really nice evening!</p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b7c92edadf970b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Kean and John" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Kean and John" src="/assets/image_123409.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>The next day we popped into central Christchurch to visit Simon Yorke at the Aurecon office. Simon has a really interesting role at Aurecon: he’s working on some very cool, innovative projects that are right on the cutting edge of how technology can be applied in the engineering industry. For instance, his team is working on projects to use VR in conjunction with bicycles and kayaks, to be able to explore future roads and waterways in a more natural way.</p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b8d2b9497a970c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="The kids playing with the AR Sandbox at Aurecon" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="The kids playing with the AR Sandbox at Aurecon" src="/assets/image_746530.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b7c92edaf2970b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="375" height="500" title="VR biking" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="VR biking" src="/assets/image_761679.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b7c92edafb970b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="375" height="500" title="I had a go, too" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="I had a go, too" src="/assets/image_66633.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>He’s also using VR to simplify existing time-consuming (and expensive) workflows related to future site inspection.</p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b7c92edaff970b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="375" height="500" title="Some interesting remote inspection tools in VR" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Some interesting remote inspection tools in VR" src="/assets/image_339039.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>We’ve met a number of times at AU, but it was really special to get the chance to see Simon in his native habitat. :-)</p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b8d2b94989970c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Kean and Simon" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Kean and Simon" src="/assets/image_695424.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>In the next post we’ll head south from Christchurch to Queenstown.</p><p><em>By the way… if you’ve enjoyed these photos, you can see more (and more regularly) via </em><a href="http://instagram.com/monde_en_poche"><em>our Instagram page</em></a><em>.</em></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b8d2b94989970c-pi" target="_blank"><br></a></p>
