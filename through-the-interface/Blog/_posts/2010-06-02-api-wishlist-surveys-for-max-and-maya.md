<p>While my blog is mostly for people working with our more horizontal “CAD” products, I expect there may be a few readers out there developing applications for some of our “Media &amp; Entertainment” products, too. So, as <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2009/08/api-wishlist-surveys-for-our-media-entertainment-products.html" target="_blank">last year</a>, here are the links to the API wishlist surveys we’ve just published for these products:</p>  <p><a href="http://www.zoomerang.com/Survey/WEB22APSHGBUNG" target="_blank">Autodesk® Maya®</a>    <br /><a href="http://www.zoomerang.com/Survey/WEB22APSJ2BUZG" target="_blank">Autodesk® 3ds Max®</a></p>  <p>The surveys will be live until <strong>July 1st, 2010</strong>. Thanks in advance to anyone who takes the time to provide our Engineering teams with this valuable feedback!</p>
