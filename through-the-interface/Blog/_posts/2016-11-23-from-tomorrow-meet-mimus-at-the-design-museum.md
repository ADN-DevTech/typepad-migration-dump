<p>Madeline Gannon’s <a href="http://designmuseum.org/exhibitions/future-exhibitions/fear-and-love" target="_blank">exhibit</a> – featuring Mimus, the industrial robot that reacts to (and even interacts with) visitors – opens tomorrow (November 24th, 2016) at the Design Museum in London. I mentioned Madeline’s project in <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2016/10/madeline-gannon-at-the-design-museum-in-london.html" target="_blank">a recent post</a> as I’d had the chance to interact with it at the Autodesk Boston BUILD space. There’s also an interesting article discussing the project that’s just been posted over on <a href="http://blogs.autodesk.com/inthefold/autodesk-supports-robot-whisperer-madeline-gannon-at-opening-of-the-design-museum" target="_blank">In the Fold</a>.</p> <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b7c8b2eefc970b-pi" target="_blank"><img title="Mimus at the Design Museum" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 30px auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="Mimus at the Design Museum" src="/assets/image_132987.jpg" width="500" height="281"></a></p> <p>Here’s a video describing the motivation behind the project in more depth:</p> <p align="center">&nbsp;</p> <p align="center"><iframe height="281" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/191963552" frameborder="0" width="500" allowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen></iframe></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>If you’re interested in how Mimus looks when not surrounded by glass, here’s the video I recorded when I met it in Boston:</p> <p align="center">&nbsp;</p> <p align="center"><iframe height="281" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Ui9-6GfFQG4?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" width="500" allowfullscreen></iframe></p> <p align="center">&nbsp;</p> <p>As I’ve said before, Madeline is performing really important research. I believe that making robots more approachable – whether ascribing them animal- or human-like traits and behaviours – is going to be an increasingly important trend as we collaborate more frequently with them.</p> <p><font color="#a5a5a5">Photo courtesy of Madeline Gannon and Autodesk.</font></p>
