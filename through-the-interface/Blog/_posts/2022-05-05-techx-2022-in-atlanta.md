<p>On Monday I flew from Geneva to Paris and then changed flights to head across to Atlanta for TechX 2022.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20278807b8371200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="287" title="The flight" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="The flight" src="/assets/image_468745.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>TechX is Autodesk’s annual internal technology geekfest. This year’s TechX – the first in-person event since <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2019/05/wrap-up-after-techx-2019-in-new-orleans.html" target="_blank">2019’s in New Orleans</a> – has been held in the Atlanta Hilton.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202942fa93ccd200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Welcome to TechX 2022" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Welcome to TechX 2022" src="/assets/image_787603.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>I have a room that’s on a high floor, and as I’m waking up with jetlag for the first time in nearly 3 years, I managed to see the view across the city as the sun came up.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202942fa93cd5200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="375" height="501" title="Hotel view" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Hotel view" src="/assets/image_2707.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>The mornings have kicked off with keynote sessions. Andrew Anagnost, our CEO, showed a slide with a nice image of Pete Storey working on the <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2022/02/building-the-2m-dar-smart-bridge.html" target="_blank">2m Dar Smart Bridge</a> project.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202942fa93e5a200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Andrew's keynote" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Andrew's keynote" src="/assets/image_778756.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>There were also a number of panel sessions and fireside chats on various topics.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20278807b82e0200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Panel discussion" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Panel discussion" src="/assets/image_42843.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>The scripted sessions had a huge projection-based teleprompter at the back of the room. Here’s a shot of me and Zach Kron attending a session.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202942fa93ce1200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Kean and Zach near the teleprompter" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Kean and Zach near the teleprompter" src="/assets/image_205237.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>The breakout sessions were quite short, this year, at 20 minutes of delivery with 10 for Q&amp;A. I wasn’t sure I’d like the shorter format, but I’ve definitely enjoyed the additional time it’s allowed for catching up with people.</p><p>Here’s a shot taken by Zach during the talk Rhys Goldstein and I gave on <a href="https://keanw.com/VASA" target="_blank">VASA</a>.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202942fa93d34200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="332" title="Me presenting about VASA" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Me presenting about VASA" src="/assets/image_571858.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Lots of people have chosen not to travel to Atlanta for this year’s event, whether because of Covid or their desire to reduce their carbon footprint. Rhys joined virtually, for instance.</p><p>I was really impressed with how the physical/virtual mix was handled. Here’s a session by the Neuron team, from which only my friend <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2020/05/dont-worry-we-must-have-finally-reached-peak-kean.html" target="_blank">Nono Martínez Alonso</a> was physically present.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202942fa93ce9200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="The Neuron team answering questions" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="The Neuron team answering questions" src="/assets/image_763823.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Some sessions were presented completely remotely, or pre-recorded. Sebastian Dunkel presented his session from Germany.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202942fa93ce5200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Sebastian presenting" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Sebastian presenting" src="/assets/image_873547.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Pete Storey had a packed audience for his session on Additive Manufacturing in Construction, presented from the Netherlands.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20282e154123d200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Pete's class is packed" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Pete's class is packed" src="/assets/image_74698.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>It may have been harder for the remote presenters – not having direct audience feedback – but the Q&amp;A seemed to work really well.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202942fa93cf2200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Pete answering questions" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Pete answering questions" src="/assets/image_696325.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>TechX for me is above all an opportunity to renew friendships and maintain professional connections.</p><p>I was very happy to get some quality time with my old friend and former manager, Jim Quanci, for instance.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20282e15412e7200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Kean and Jim" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Kean and Jim" src="/assets/image_900115.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>And there’s often time in the bar to hang out. Here’s Alex Tessier and the Webb brothers (Fenton and Mark aren’t actually related, believe it or not).</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20282e1541241200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Alex, Fenton and Mark" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Alex, Fenton and Mark" src="/assets/image_569990.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Here are some members of the Autodesk Research team, hanging out in a Tiki bar.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202942fa93cfa200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Tiki bar research" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Tiki bar research" src="/assets/image_932278.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>TechX attendees often take their socializing really seriously. These kind of technical interactions and knowledge sharing is super-valuable for the organisation, especially after 2 years of pandemic. </p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20278807b8302200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Animated discussions" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Animated discussions" src="/assets/image_614977.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>I’d been seeing some interesting characters – who clearly weren’t here to TechX – in the lobby of the Hilton. Shaan Hurley and I decided to head across to the Mariott – conveniently connected to the Hilton by a sky bridge – to check out its impressive architecture and see what was going on there.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20278807b8438200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="The sky bridge to the Marriott" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="The sky bridge to the Marriott" src="/assets/image_925836.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>On arrival it was clear something very different to TechX was going on.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20282e1541249200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="375" height="501" title="The enchanted forest" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="The enchanted forest" src="/assets/image_679562.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Marriott_Marquis" target="_blank">Marriot’s atrium</a> is world-renowned and really impressive.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202942fa93cfe200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="375" height="500" title="Shaan and Kean in the Mariott atrium" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Shaan and Kean in the Mariott atrium" src="/assets/image_549251.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>The event being held there alongside TechX is the <a href="https://www.furryweekend.com/" target="_blank">Enchanted Forest</a>, an event for people interested in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furry_fandom" target="_blank">furry</a> culture. I must be either old or sheltered – or both! – as this was a real eye-opener for me.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202942fa93ea0200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="375" height="500" title="Furries" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Furries" src="/assets/image_424045.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Anyway, tonight’s closing event for TechX 2022 is being held at the <a href="https://www.georgiaaquarium.org/" target="_blank">Georgia Aquarium</a>, which should be amazing. I’ll post some pictures on <a href="https://twitter.com/keanw" target="_blank">Twitter</a>.</p>
