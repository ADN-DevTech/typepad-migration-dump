<p>A few events have happened over the last few weeks that I would have loved to have attended, had I had the energy (and been in better shape).</p><p>The first was the grand opening of the Autodesk Gallery on May 11th. I received an invite – because of my participation in the NEST project – but as I was planning on actually <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2022/05/the-nest-buildings-hilo-roof.html" target="_blank">being at the NEST building that day</a> I declined. And I ended up being home with Covid, so there’s that.</p><p>The gallery was opened by SF Mayor London Breed. Here’s a snap of Andrew Anagnost showing the <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2022/02/the-nest-exhibit-at-the-new-autodesk-gallery.html" target="_blank">NEST exhibit</a> to Mayor Breed.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202942faba5d7200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="333" title="Mayor Breed checking out the NEST exhibit" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Mayor Breed checking out the NEST exhibit" src="/assets/image_556528.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Here’s <a href="https://youtu.be/k4-SC5YxZFo" target="_blank">a nice video summary</a> of the event:</p><p align="center"><br></p><p align="center"><iframe width="500" height="283" title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/k4-SC5YxZFo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"></iframe></p><p><br></p><p>The other event was <a href="https://www.digitalconstructionweek.com/" target="_blank">Digital Construction Week 2022</a> at the ExCeL in London. The <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2022/02/building-the-2m-dar-smart-bridge.html" target="_blank">2m Dar Smart Bridge</a> was once again on display – the first time since <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2022/04/bim-world-paris-2022.html" target="_blank">BIM World Paris</a> – and I had hoped to get across to help out, but ended up (actually quite wisely) deciding to head directly home after the <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2022/05/smarter-bridges-conference-2022.html" target="_blank">Smarter Bridges Conference</a> rather than making the detour via London.</p><p>That said, I did end up on a Zoom call from Schipol Airport – with Pete Storey at the ExCeL and Nic Carey in San Francisco – to help get everything ready for DCW the night before: we had to nail down the process to get realtime data displayed inside <a href="https://dasher360.com" target="_blank">Dasher</a>, so that it would all work smoothly during the event. Which thankfully it did.</p><p>Pete has kindly shared some snaps of the event for me to post here. This is probably the state of the bridge while we were on our prep call:</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20278807df20e200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Setting up" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Setting up" src="/assets/image_876494.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Once finished, the Dar stand looked rather tidy.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20282e1567775200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="The Dar stand" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="The Dar stand" src="/assets/image_972592.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Autodesk was also present: our Autodesk Construction Solutions team had an ACC-branded stand.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202942faba5db200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="The Autodesk stand" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="The Autodesk stand" src="/assets/image_452675.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>The Dar stand was right next to the Net Zero Stage.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20278807df216200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Next to the theatre" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Next to the theatre" src="/assets/image_322266.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>If you look closely you can see the bridge – and Dasher – in the background.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20282e1567785200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="The bridge is in the background" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="The bridge is in the background" src="/assets/image_648669.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Here’s a nice shot from below the bridge.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20282e156778d200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="The bridge from below" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="The bridge from below" src="/assets/image_382238.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>My colleague, Josh, did make it across to London on his way back from Amsterdam to Toronto. I’m really happy he got to see the bridge in person!</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20278807df21e200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Josh by the bridge" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Josh by the bridge" src="/assets/image_257560.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Here’s one last snap of Pete and Josh with Magda, another Research colleague.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20278807df222200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="228" height="500" title="Magda, Pete and Josh" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Magda, Pete and Josh" src="/assets/image_460848.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>It would have been nice to have been able to visit DCW 2022, although apparently British health &amp; safety regulations meant I wouldn’t have been able to walk on it as we did in Paris.</p><p>I’m hoping the bridge will be across in <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2022/03/autodesk-university-2022-will-be-in-new-orleans.html" target="_blank">New Orleans</a> for Autodesk University 2022 in late September. At this stage it’s not certain I will be, though: somewhat disappointingly none of <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2022/04/three-au-proposals-to-vote-for-and-a-deadline-reminder.html" target="_blank">my AU proposals</a> made the cut, this year, but if the bridge is there then I’d hope to be there, too. Let’s see.</p>
