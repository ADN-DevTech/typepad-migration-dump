<p>Just to put the cherry on the cake that was my week in San Francisco, I went across to Pier 9, this afternoon, to catch up with David Thomasson and visit the robotics laboratory belonging to Autodesk’s Office of the CTO.</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201bb0885fd05970d-pi" target="_blank"><img title="A robot arm to be used at AU 2015" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 50px auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="A robot arm to be used at AU 2015" src="/assets/image_515762.jpg" width="504" height="285" /></a></p>  <p>David and team are working on some really interesting projects. The first will be unveiled at <a href="http://au.autodesk.com/las-vegas/overview" target="_blank">AU 2015</a> and investigates the potential for humans and robots to build things together that neither group could on their own.</p>  <p>Visitors to the exhibit at AU will have tasks to perform in conjunction with robots – with these tasks being coordinated centrally and communicated via wearable technology – leading to the construction of a wooden structure made out of unique, custom-built elements.</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201bb0885fd09970d-pi" target="_blank"><img title="David Thomasson clipping some pieces together" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 50px auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="David Thomasson clipping some pieces together" src="/assets/image_423142.jpg" width="504" height="285" /></a></p>  <p>The Lab is also working on <a href="http://mx3d.com/projects/bridge/" target="_blank">a really cool collaboration with Dutch designer Joris Laaram</a>. You may have seen it <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/robots-to-build-a-3d-printed-bridge-in-amsterdam-2015-6" target="_blank">in the press</a>: sets of robots will essentially “3D print” a welded metal bridge across a river in Amsterdam.</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b8d16c0755970c-pi" target="_blank"><img title="Rendering of robots printing a bridge across a river" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 50px auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="Rendering of robots printing a bridge across a river" src="/assets/image_20181.jpg" width="504" height="316" /></a></p>  <p>A member of the OCTO team on Pier 9, Evan Atherton, also wrote and directed the fun short “Artoo in Love”. It was nice to meet him in person.</p>  <p align="center">&#160;</p>  <p align="center"><iframe height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1bK7FUWIvuE?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" width="560" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>You’ll notice the pink R2 unit in the below photo of the lab, alongside some pretty serious bots.</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b8d16c075d970c-pi" target="_blank"><img title="The OCTO robotics lab" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 50px auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="The OCTO robotics lab" src="/assets/image_768355.jpg" width="504" height="285" /></a></p>  <p>All in all a great way to wrap up the week. Now I just have my email mountain to work through while heading back towards the physical Alps!</p>
