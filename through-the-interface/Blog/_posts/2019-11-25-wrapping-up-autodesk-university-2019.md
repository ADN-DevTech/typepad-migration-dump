<p>Wednesday and Thursday were my busy days at this year’s Autodesk University in Las Vegas. After a breakfast meeting with a colleague from Toronto, I had my first class of AU2019 to deliver.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4a12e22200c-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="All you need is love" border="0" height="339" src="/assets/image_41405.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="All you need is love" width="452" /></a></p><p>It was a live-streamed class that was focused on advanced visualization (primarily of IoT data) using the Forge viewer. Somewhat unfortunately the class was scheduled at the same time as the AEC mainstage (more on this later), but that basically just meant that the room wasn’t completely full and that most of the attendees were Forge-focused.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4a12975200c-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="The Dasher livestream class" border="0" height="277" src="/assets/image_609443.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="The Dasher livestream class" width="500" /></a></p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4ca5a56200d-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="From the back" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_593104.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="From the back" width="500" /></a><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4a1297d200c-pi" target="_blank"><img align="left" alt="From the front" border="0" height="339" src="/assets/image_300520.jpg" style="margin: 30px 0px 30px 120px; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: left; display: inline; background-image: none;" title="From the front" width="226" /></a></p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4ef09a1200b-pi" target="_blank"><img align="right" alt="Some kind of gesture" border="0" height="339" src="/assets/image_181355.jpg" style="margin: 30px 120px 30px 0px; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: right; display: inline; background-image: none;" title="Some kind of gesture" width="226" /><br /></a></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>As it was live-streamed the <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/autodesk-university/class/Advanced-Data-Visualization-Using-Forge-Viewer-2019-0#video" target="_blank">class recording</a> is already available:</p><p><br /></p><p><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="283" src="//player.ooyala.com/static/v4/candidate/latest/skin-plugin/iframe.html?ec=w1YXR1aTE6F4or1oua8PhtoruXmiTgxR&amp;pbid=e7917642de4a4f1eae0a331375e03784&amp;pcode=o3OG46qoFLfL76WkTkb1a9k23qBd" width="500"></iframe></p><p><br /></p><p>Since returning I’ve had the chance to go back and watch the AEC mainstage. It was really well done, this year. Not only that, but <a href="http://dasher360.com" target="_blank">Dasher 360</a> was featured prominently (even if it had it’s “brand” blanked out).</p><p>As I wasn’t there to take photos, here are some screenshots from the <a href="https://ustream.tv/recorded/124679397" target="_blank">recorded live-stream</a>. Nicolas Mangon kicked things off and was the one to focus on “digital twins”:</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4ca5a71200d-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="Nicolas Mangon showing Dasher on the AEC maintage" border="0" height="271" src="/assets/image_642970.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="Nicolas Mangon showing Dasher on the AEC maintage" width="500" /></a></p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4ef0e63200b-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="The hospital model" border="0" height="271" src="/assets/image_271821.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="The hospital model" width="500" /></a></p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4ca5a60200d-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="Navigating floors" border="0" height="280" src="/assets/image_897764.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="Navigating floors" width="500" /></a></p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4a12e54200c-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="Sensor locations" border="0" height="280" src="/assets/image_669771.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="Sensor locations" width="500" /></a></p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4ef0e57200b-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="Showing sensor data" border="0" height="280" src="/assets/image_494454.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="Showing sensor data" width="500" /></a></p><p>It was great to see so much of Dasher on the big screen! It was also great to see Project Refinery get a mention during Racel Williams’s excellent segment (I was really impressed with how well both Racel and Alli Scott presented during the mainstage – great job, both of you!).<a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4ca5a7d200d-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="Refinery, too" border="0" height="280" src="/assets/image_354030.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="Refinery, too" width="500" /></a></p><p>If you’re interested in watching the “digital twins” section, it’s between the 19- and 24-minute marks. The whole thing is well worth watching, though.</p><p><br /></p><p><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="283" scrolling="no" src="https://ustream.tv/embed/recorded/124679397" style="border: 0px transparent; border-image: none;" webkitallowfullscreen="" width="500"></iframe></p><p><br /></p><p>The rest of my Wednesday was spent in customer meetings, although I did manage to stick my head into the Design Slam to see it beginning. It looked like a lot of fun!</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4ca5a9d200d-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="Design Slam" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_118368.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="Design Slam" width="500" /></a></p><p>After the day’s meeting were over, there was a “mixer” for members of the CTO organization and special guests (I had a very nice time catching up with Thord Backe, for instance – someone I’ve known since my early days at Autodesk).</p><p>After this I popped into the Dynamo Party across the Strip at Señor Frog&#39;s. (I saw a number of people jumping the barrier to cross the Strip rather than walking a bit further to take the overpass… my friend Elise and I joked about them playing Señor Frogger.) We arrived while the “lightning talks” were taking place. The first I saw was by Dominique Aupy from Engie AXIMA.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4ef0e70200b-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="Dominique from Engie AXIMA" border="0" height="500" src="/assets/image_835855.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="Dominique from Engie AXIMA" width="375" /></a></p><p>Up next was That BIM Girl, Jacqueline Rohrmann.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4ca5aaf200d-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="Jacqueline&#39;s lightning talk" border="0" height="500" src="/assets/image_144791.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="Jacqueline&#39;s lightning talk" width="375" /></a></p><p>Jaime Rosales was there filming:</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4ca5ab7200d-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="Jaime filming" border="0" height="500" src="/assets/image_21580.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="Jaime filming" width="375" /></a></p><p>Many old friends were there, despite the poor weather (raining in Las Vegas?!?). I enjoyed catching up with Racel and Mehdi, among others.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4ef0e7b200b-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="Kean, Racel and Mehdi" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_754059.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="Kean, Racel and Mehdi" width="500" /></a></p><p>Thursday started with a quick customer meeting before my 10:30am class on Project Rediscover.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4ca5ac2200d-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="Rediscover intro" border="0" height="350" src="/assets/image_842404.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="Rediscover intro" width="500" /></a></p><p>This one was also recorded, but I don’t think recordings of classes that weren’t live-streamed are available yet (I’ll post the recording once it is, of course).</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4ca5acc200d-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="The link to the graph" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_867443.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="The link to the graph" width="500" /></a></p><p>There was a good crowd in this class – the room was pretty much at capacity.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4ef0e91200b-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="The room was nicely full" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_341383.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="The room was nicely full" width="500" /></a></p><p>After a break over lunch, I had my last “speaking gig” of the week, with my first ever <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/autodesk-university/content/AU-2019-Theater-Talks" target="_blank">AU Theater Talk</a>. This was part of the <a href="https://autodeskuniversity.smarteventscloud.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=320304" target="_blank">Transformation of Design</a> track, which contained four talks of 12-15 minutes each.</p><p>The room was <em>really</em> full – it was all quite intimidating.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4a1322e200c-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="In the theater" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_51776.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="In the theater" width="500" /></a></p><p>The first speaker was David Weir-McCall, who talked about “Where Digital Reality and Reality Coexist”.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4a12ec0200c-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="David Weir-McCall" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_564829.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="David Weir-McCall" width="500" /></a></p><p>I then talked about “Building the Infrastructure for Performance-Based Generative Design”. (Thanks to Russell Loveridge, who kindly snapped these two photos while I was speaking.)</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4ef0e9c200b-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="Introducing the concept" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_71441.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="Introducing the concept" width="500" /></a><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4a12ecf200c-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="My first Theater Talk" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_363206.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="My first Theater Talk" width="500" /></a></p><p>Next was Bill Allen, who talked about “Where Do We Go From Here? Crossing The Data Driven Chasm.” Including some fun he’s had optimising pizza with Project Refinery.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4ca5aea200d-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="Bill Allen" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_609298.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="Bill Allen" width="500" /></a></p><p>The final speaker was Jeffrey McGrew, who presented “Talking with Robots about Architecture. Or how Automation is changing the construction industry.”</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4ef0ea8200b-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="Jeff McGrew" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_347305.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="Jeff McGrew" width="500" /></a></p><p>Here’s the recording of my slot, in case you’re interested:</p><p><br /></p><p><iframe allowfullscreen="" allowtransparency="true" class="wistia_embed" frameborder="0" height="283" name="wistia_embed" scrolling="no" src="https://fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/sgasw8d1qu" title="Wistia video player" width="500"></iframe></p><p><br /></p><p>It was a real honour being included in this session: the other speakers were excellent… I have no idea how I stacked up – and as I hate watching myself on screen I’ll probably never find out – and I’m really glad to have had the opportunity, despite the additional stress.</p><p>Once this was done I had one final customer meeting before heading to the airport for my Thursday night flight home. I actually had no regrets about missing the last night’s party: I was completely shattered by this point, and just dreamed of sleeping on the plane.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4a13146200c-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="Arrived in London" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_477771.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="Arrived in London" width="500" /></a></p><p>I had a fairly quick connection at Heathrow before my onwards flight to Geneva. By the time I got home it was 10pm on Friday night, and I’ve spent much of the weekend catching up on sleep. Hopefully I’ll be back at 100% before too long!</p><p>It was great seeing so many people in Las Vegas. Thanks to all of you who took the time to say hello (and I’m sorry if others saw me rushing by and chose not to stop me… it really was a busy one, this year). If you haven’t yet filled out your class evaluations, please do so via the AU app (if you still can… as I didn’t have time to attend – and scan into – any classes, I haven’t received any surveys myself).</p><p><strong>Update:</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.keanw.com/2019/12/my-au-2019-classes.html" target="_blank">Here’s a post</a> that includes recordings for all three of my classes at this year’s AU.</p>
