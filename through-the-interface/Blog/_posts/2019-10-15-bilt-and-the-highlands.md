<p>After the <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2019/10/the-dbei-generative-design-hackathon-in-edinburgh.html" target="_blank">pre-BILT Hackathon on Wednesday</a>, there were still three full days of the main conference to be experienced in the beautiful city of Edinburgh. My family was with me – at the start of our 2-week Scottish adventure – so I wasn’t planning (or able) to spend the full 3 days at the conference.</p><p>I did make it along to the opening keynote, however, which was largely run by <a href="https://twitter.com/lefich" target="_blank">Marcus Fich</a>, who introduced two Danish psychologists who talked about (among other things) our response to stressful situations. It was a very different and interesting session.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4bae0bc200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="BILT Day One keynote" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="BILT Day One keynote" src="/assets/image_717100.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>After that I went off to meet my family at around lunchtime. I walked across Edinburgh – it’s a very walkable city, as far as it goes – to meet them in the old centre.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4df8cd4200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="A nice old building" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="A nice old building" src="/assets/image_997628.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>They were at the <a href="https://www.nms.ac.uk/national-museum-of-scotland/" target="_blank">National Museum of Scotland</a>, a genuine national treasure. We mainly went around looking at their fascinating historic artifacts (we were mainly interested in the Scottish ones, but their collection is highly diverse and impressive), but there was also an exhibition on fashion design that I popped through, snapping this shot of <a href="https://www.zaha-hadid.com/design/nova-shoe/" target="_blank">some crazy cantilever shoes designed by Zaha Hadid</a>.<a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4bae0c7200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Zaha Hadid's NOVA shoes" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Zaha Hadid's NOVA shoes" src="/assets/image_920273.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>I headed back to BILT for the evening event, which was held at the stunning <a href="http://www.gosfordhouse.co.uk/" target="_blank">Gosford House</a>. They asked us not to post pictures of the contained artwork on social media, so here’s a shot of Ben and Javier from <a href="https://www.herzogdemeuron.com" target="_blank">Herzog de Meuron</a> – who are also based in Switzerland – checking out the locally distilled whiskey. (Yes, at my request they were hamming it up for the photo.)</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4bae0d0200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Tasting whisky with Ben and Javier from Herzon de Meuron" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Tasting whisky with Ben and Javier from Herzon de Meuron" src="/assets/image_120046.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>On Friday I spent a bit more time at BILT, at least during the day. I caught up on a few bits and pieces during the opening keynote (I would have liked to have seen it, but had a blog post to write, among other things).</p><p>I then went along to Dieter Vermeulen’s session on Generative Design. It was nice to see him give a shout out to <a href="http://dasher360.com/" target="_blank">Dasher 360</a>:</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a491afb9200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Dieter showing Dasher 360" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Dieter showing Dasher 360" src="/assets/image_981069.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>As well as highlighting some of the work Autodesk Research has done on GD, too.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4bae0db200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Dieter talking GD" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Dieter talking GD" src="/assets/image_225200.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>During the afternoon I had the honour of being Matt Jezyk’s teaching assistant. He did a truly amazing job of stepping people through using Refinery. And the best thing is that <a href="https://github.com/tatlin/BiLT_NA_2019_How_To_Train_Your_Model" target="_blank">his entire class material is available online</a>. Check it out – it’s (unsurprisingly) an excellent resource.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a491afbf200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Matt's Refinery lab and a sea of solar analysis" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Matt's Refinery lab and a sea of solar analysis" src="/assets/image_380920.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Despite having a secondary role in the proceedings, by the time it was over I was a little tired. I headed off to meet my family for an evening ghost tour of Edinburgh (ooooooo) and opted to head back with them rather than come back for BILT’s networking reception. That was it for my first BILT… hopefully next time I’ll get to experience more of it (although the next European event is in Valencia, which sounds like another good family destination ;-).</p><p>On Saturday morning, we picked up a hire car (actually a 9-seater minibus, but that’s another story) and headed off to explore. Our first stop was actually back south of the border: we headed down to Brampton (near Carlisle) to catch up with family. We stayed at a lovely B&amp;B/hotel that <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2014/04/fun-in-the-uk.html" target="_blank">we first stayed at 5 years ago</a>.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4df9237200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="The Oakwood Park Hotel in Brampton" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="The Oakwood Park Hotel in Brampton" src="/assets/image_238808.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>From there we headed back up to Oban, the home of one my favourite non-Islay whiskeys. The flat we ended up with wasn’t anywhere near as nice as the one we’d enjoyed in Edinburgh, but the location was fantastic.</p><p>Firstly, the view:</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4df8d08200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="View from our window" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="View from our window" src="/assets/image_370384.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>And secondly, the distance from the distillery. Or maybe that should have been first? Anyway.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4bae0f3200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Distillery to doorstep" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Distillery to doorstep" src="/assets/image_335957.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>The distillery has been around 225 years, and it was a real treat to hear (and taste) its history.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4df8d17200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="375" height="500" title="The Oban Distillery" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="The Oban Distillery" src="/assets/image_971079.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Here’s our guide, Jim, extracting some 9 year-old spirit (which couldn’t yet be called whiskey) for us to taste.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a491afe5200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Tapping an Oban keg with a large pipette" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Tapping an Oban keg with a large pipette" src="/assets/image_442957.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>We did get some of the Oban 14 year-old to try, too (although this wasn’t strictly needed… I know it well enough).</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a491afda200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Tasing the Oban 14 year-old" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Tasing the Oban 14 year-old" src="/assets/image_978053.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Aside from the distillery, the town of Oban (which apparently means Little Bay in Gaelic) has a lot to offer, especially outside of peak tourist season. Here’s a view across the harbour:</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a491aff7200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="202" title="Oban harbour" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Oban harbour" src="/assets/image_840711.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>We also went for a walk around the village of Kilmore, just to experience something a little less touristy.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4df8d3f200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Walking near Kilmore" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Walking near Kilmore" src="/assets/image_959995.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>On our last morning in Oban, I decided to get up early and go for a run. I ran up to the nearby <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Attraction_Review-g186501-d10623308-Reviews-Pulpit_Hill-Oban_Argyll_and_Bute_Scotland.html" target="_blank">Pulpit Hill</a> – which had a great view across the bay – and decided to run onwards from there. I spotted a walking path that said it went to the ferry for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerrera" target="_blank">Isle of Kerrera</a> (which I knew to be across from Oban, so I thought “why not?”).</p><p>It turned out to be a great – albeit tricky – choice. The run was amazing, but at times it turned into a bit of a steeplechase: I found myself splashing through bog every 20 metres or so. Still a lot of fun, though.<a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4df8d4b200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Running across the moors" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Running across the moors" src="/assets/image_233858.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>When I finally got to the end of the boggy area, I was rewarded with a gorgeous view across to Kerrera.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a491b00b200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="131" title="The view down towards the Isle of Kerrera" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="The view down towards the Isle of Kerrera" src="/assets/image_787423.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>On the way back I had the chance to snap a few more nice photos. Here’s one of the morning light hitting a sailing boat in the bay.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a491b015200c-pi" target="_blank"><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4df8d56200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="221" title="Light hitting a siling boat in the little bay" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Light hitting a siling boat in the little bay" src="/assets/image_718787.jpg" border="0"></a></a></p><p>From here we headed to Skye. We stopped a few times to stretch our legs, on the way. One of these times was to see the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenfinnan_Viaduct" target="_blank">Glenfillan Viaduct</a> – which was made famous by the Harry Potter movies (yes, this was part of the trip’s theme, after all).</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4bae5c7200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="The Glenfillan Viaduct" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="The Glenfillan Viaduct" src="/assets/image_76433.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>The view the other way – out across the sea – was just as impressive.</p><p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a491b015200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="View from Glenfinnen" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="View from Glenfinnen" src="/assets/image_92379.jpg" border="0"></a></p></p><p>Back on the road, we saw some amazing scenery. Travelling through the Highlands in autumn is an incredible experience.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4bae13a200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="View from the road" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="View from the road" src="/assets/image_378537.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>We did have to put our foot down a little to get to Mallaig for the ferry to Armadale. (You can also take <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skye_Bridge" target="_blank">the bridge</a>, but we’d have had to do quite a few miles back round, and the ferry sounded fun.) But we got there in good time, which was good (the following ferry left 2 hours later, which meant we’d probably have had to drive the long way round, after all.)</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4bae147200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="On the ferry to Skye" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="On the ferry to Skye" src="/assets/image_620540.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>We’re looking forward to discovering Skye and all it has to offer. Yes, including the Talisker distillery (which <em>really is</em> my favourite non-Islay tipple).</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4df8d75200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Ah, Scotland" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Ah, Scotland" src="/assets/image_917254.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>But more on that next time!</p>
