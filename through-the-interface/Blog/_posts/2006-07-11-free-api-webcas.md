<p>The DevTech team spends a substantial amount of time delivering API training, and not just to ADN members. We schedule class-room trainings at various Autodesk facilities, deliver training on-site at developers' offices, and deliver training webcasts via Microsoft LiveMeeting.</p>

<p>Mikako Harada, the team lead for DevTech East Asia and the technical lead for our BSD workgroup, will deliver a webcast on Architectural Desktop's .NET API on July 13th. This webcast is <strong>absolutely free to everyone</strong>.</p>

<p>For more information on our API training - and to register for the webcast - please check Autodesk's API training page at <a href="http://www.autodesk.com/apitraining">http://www.autodesk.com/apitraining</a>. For your convenience, here's a direct link to the <a href="http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/index?siteID=123112&amp;id=781651">API training schedule</a>.</p>

<p>By the way - we do post recordings of our API webcasts to the ADN website, although you do need to be a member of ADN to access them.</p>
