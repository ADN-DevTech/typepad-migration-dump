<p>So here it is, <a href="https://youtu.be/UhNdrPYUk2U" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the last episode of 2021</a>. The first game we attempted to play – <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Huey_UH-IX" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Super Huey</a> – in many ways set the scene for the rest of the episode. Here’s a quote about the game from one of its reviews, as per its Wikipedia entry:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&quot;For those desiring an 8-bit helicopter flight simulator, Super Huey and its sequels fill the bill. For those desiring excitement as well, it would pay dividends to look elsewhere.&quot;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ouch.</p>
<p>After not even being able to take off, we moved on to <a href="http://www.gb64.com/game.php?id=1847&amp;h=0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Crystal Fever</a> (which I failed to find a level disk for, and so couldn’t play), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knightmare_(1987_video_game)" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Knightmare</a> (a graphical adventure that really isn’t fun to play – or watch! – during a Floppy Friday) and then a mediocre platformer called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karnov" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Karnov</a> and an underwhelming strategy game called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BattleTech:_The_Crescent_Hawk%27s_Inception" rel="noopener" target="_blank">BattleTech</a>. The best of the bunch – in my opinion, anyway – was the last game, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rampage_(1986_video_game)" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Rampage</a>. It was at least a bit more fun that the others.</p>
