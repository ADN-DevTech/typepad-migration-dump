<p>In today’s episode of Floppy Friday we use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_128#Commodore_128D" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Commodore 128D</a> – with integrated, double-sided floppy drive! – to play some classic arcade games.</p>
<p>Many thanks to Daniel from Bern for parting with the C= 128D via an online auction: this was his family’s home computer growing up. It even came with a Seikosha SP-1200VC, which I’m dying to try out. (I grew up with an Epson FX-80, and I just love the raw – sometimes harsh – music of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_matrix_printing" rel="noopener" target="_blank">dot matrix printer</a>.)</p>
<p>So why play classic arcade games on an early “personal” (rather than “home”) computer? It was really in response to a request from my old friend Fernando Malard to play Asteroids, and it just happened that I’d picked up the C= 128D and was itching to use it. While Atari never made an official port of Asteroids for Commodore systems, I managed to track an unofficial version down on a 1987 collection of games released by Firebird as <a href="http://www.gamebase64.com/game.php?id=361&amp;h=0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Arcade Classics</a>.</p>
<p>As it was in the same collection, I started off the session by playing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Invaders" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Space Invaders</a> and then went on to play <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroids_%28video_game%29" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Asteroids</a> before loading an “Asteroids on steroids” (haha) game called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mega_Apocalypse" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Mega Apocalypse</a>.</p>
<p>(By the way, I’m sorry for not judging the framing of the video properly: the fact I had a computer with a larger desk footprint threw me a little, so I’m in-frame a bit less than usually. Which may not be such a bad thing, all things considered! :-)</p>

<p>Something <a href="https://twitter.com/keanw/status/1354398391170723840" rel="noopener" target="_blank">I posted on Twitter</a>, earlier in the week: my joystick collection has grown, with a couple of additions coming from Daniel’s auction lot. And yes, I really should have anticipated the willy jokes before posting this image online. Sigh.</p>
<p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20263e98bf706200b-pi" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Joysticks" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_120045.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="Joysticks" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>I will say that I still prefer to play with “<a href="https://www.retrothing.com/2011/12/worst-retro-joystick-ever.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the worst joystick ever</a>” (see <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2021/01/floppy-friday-12.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Floppy Friday #12</a>), despite having many more to choose from. Which probably says more about me that I want it to.</p>
<p>Next time I’m probably going to give actual business programs – such as CAD! – a go on the C= 128D. I’ve given it a try in an emulator – which admittedly wasn’t especially successful – so I’m expecting this to be a <em>very</em> interesting experience.</p>
