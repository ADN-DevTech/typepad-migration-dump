I was there when the doors opened so I could make it home for a late lunch.</p> <p>As usual there was plenty of shiny on display at this year’s show. I liked the fact that I could watch the reflection in the paintwork of a physical car of a video that was certainly computer-generated before the car was completed. With its own reflections of a synthetic environment outside its windows, of course. All very meta.</p> <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b7c81fcc91970b-pi" target="_blank"><img title="The synthetic reflected in the real" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 30px auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="The synthetic reflected in the real" src="/assets/image_838432.jpg" width="504" height="285"></a></p> <p>My initial goal was to swing by the stand of the Morgan Motor Company to check out their <a href="http://www.morgan-motor.co.uk/ev3/" target="_blank">EV3</a>, an electric version of their 3 Wheeler. Morgan made heavy use of Autodesk’s CFD tools when creating the design for this beauty, something I hope <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2013/09/an-interview-with-jon-wells-part-1.html" target="_blank">to speak to</a> <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2013/09/an-interview-with-jon-wells-part-2.html" target="_blank">Jon Wells about</a>, at some point.</p> <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b7c81fcc95970b-pi" target="_blank"><img title="The Morgan EV3" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 30px auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="The Morgan EV3" src="/assets/image_444203.jpg" width="504" height="285"></a></p> <p align="left">Here’s the EV3 launch video from last week…</p> <p align="left">&nbsp;</p> <p align="center"><iframe height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MUsE4rkfzkc?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" width="500" allowfullscreen></iframe></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>It wasn’t the only electric car on display, of course. I also popped by Tesla’s stand to see the <a href="https://www.teslamotors.com/modelx" target="_blank">Model X</a> – the only one of them in Europe, so far – as it’s also a car I’m very interested in. We test drove the Model S last year, but it was always clear that the X would be more practical for my family. I’m looking forward to getting the chance to test-drive the X sometime later in the year. Whether I ever end up buying one is another question entirely, of course.</p> <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201bb08c47d3c970d-pi" target="_blank"><img title="The Tesla Model X" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 30px auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="The Tesla Model X" src="/assets/image_856870.jpg" width="504" height="285"></a></p> <p>In my new role in Autodesk Research – with a focus on IoT and VR – I was curious to see what automotive companies were doing in these fields. I went by the Ford stand to try their consumer-centric VR experience.</p> <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b8d1aa2af5970c-pi" target="_blank"><img title="VR on the Ford stand" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 30px auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="VR on the Ford stand" src="/assets/image_42571.jpg" width="504" height="285"></a></p> <p>Frankly I was disappointed: you sat in a virtual car as it displayed a bunch of autonomous capabilities and other advanced features… which was fine. But the rendering wasn’t even stereo – as far as I could tell – so it was just another way of visualizing panoramic game content. It seems a shame to go that far engineering an experience and not actually deliver 3D content. Not that I’m <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2016/03/vr-for-design-visualization-part-1.html" target="_blank">a VR purist</a>, or anything… it just goes to show that requirements around the use of VR from a consumer/entertainment perspective are different: I don’t think I’d have cared as much about such visual “quality” if I’d been using the tool for design visualization. But I was there to be wowed!</p> <p>I didn’t try VR at this stand, but judging from the body language I’m not convinced this experience was much better. I do love taking pictures of people immersed in VR, though.</p> <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b7c81fcc9c970b-pi" target="_blank"><img title="Virtual driving at the Motor Show" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 30px auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="Virtual driving at the Motor Show" src="/assets/image_937605.jpg" width="504" height="285"></a></p> <p>On the IoT front, Volkswagen had a “late stage” concept car on display called the <a href="http://fortune.com/2016/01/06/volkswagen-electric-microbus/" target="_blank">BUDD-e</a>.</p> <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201bb08c47d4f970d-pi" target="_blank"><img title="The VW e-Buddy. IoT gone mad" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 30px auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="The VW e-Buddy. IoT gone mad" src="/assets/image_103037.jpg" width="504" height="285"></a></p> <p>To find out more about the car, I went to one of their information islands and navigated through the available feature descriptions by placing a special hockey puck-like object on their digital tabletop and rotating it around to highlight the various features. I then had to wait several seconds for the related description for each to be displayed. Completely unintuitive and pointless: they had to have someone standing there to explain how to use it (or perhaps to stop people from stealing the puck ;-). Features of the BUDD-e included the ability to check the progress of your washing machine from the car (yes, they seriously listed that as a feature), <a href="https://youtu.be/Dp-IMZV_BrQ" target="_blank">hand gestures to open the doors</a> and voice control to adjust the car’s temperature. Why? Because they can.</p> <p>All that said, I do believe there’s a lot of real value in both VR and IoT, and it’s inevitable companies will overshoot the mark from time to time as the technologies work their way through the <a href="http://www.gartner.com/technology/research/methodologies/hype-cycle.jsp" target="_blank">Gartner Hype Cycle</a>. Which is fine: I’m all for exploring possibilities. The real value will emerge, over time, until the technologies are so commonplace as to be considered completely mundane.</p>
