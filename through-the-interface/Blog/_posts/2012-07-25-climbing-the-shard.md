<p>Today’s post was going to be “Enjoying England” – just to complete the series on our <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2012/07/enjoying-brittany.html" target="_blank">European</a> <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2012/07/enjoying-wales.html" target="_blank">tour</a> – but that’s now going to have to wait. We are indeed enjoying England, but yesterday had a pretty unique and amazing opportunity that deserves a post of its own.</p>  <p>Before yesterday, I admittedly didn’t know very much at all about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shard_London_Bridge" target="_blank">Shard London Bridge</a> (which I’ll refer to from here on as “the Shard”). But then a friend of ours offered us the chance to go to the top, which was pretty unique (he’s been working on the project for the last 6+ years, and will soon be finishing up his part of it). One thing I certainly didn’t know was just how exposed we’d end up being, up there.</p>  <p>The Shard is an extremely impressive structure – and I’m sure our software was used in various places during its design and construction, although I have no specific knowledge of where and how – that is currently <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tallest_buildings_in_the_European_Union" target="_blank">the tallest building in the EU</a>.</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2017743965743970d-pi" target="_blank"><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 20px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="The Shard from below" border="0" alt="The Shard from below" src="/assets/image_945376.jpg" width="354" height="537" /></a></p>    <p>While the Shard is nearing completion, there’s still a lot of work going on, inside: we had to don protective clothing appropriate to a construction site before going up. We only entered at 5:45pm, and had to complete our visit before a scheduled power outage started at 7:00pm (walking down via the stairs is apparently not recommended, understandably enough ;-), so we were on a fairly tight schedule.</p>  <p>The first lift took us up to the 32nd floor, where we changed for a second lift that took us to the 68th. This is the floor that will contain the publicly accessible restaurant – and allow people access to the viewing gallery from 69 to 71 – and the view was admittedly pretty stunning from there. On this visit, however, we were able to climb stairs to the 84th, the highest physical floor in the tower.</p>  <p>Now I have a bit of an issue with heights – I had enough problems with being at the top of <a href="http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phare_de_Tr%C3%A9zien" target="_blank">the Phare de Trézien</a>, last week – so this was no mean feat, for me. Especially at the higher levels of the Shard, where – given the openness afforded by the gaps where the shard fragments meet – you’re <u>really</u> exposed:</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2017616b01570970c-pi" target="_blank"><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 20px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="The tip of the Shard" border="0" alt="The tip of the Shard" src="/assets/image_715185.jpg" width="317" height="319" /></a></p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2017616b016c1970c-pi" target="_blank"><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 20px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="On the 84th floor" border="0" alt="On the 84th floor" src="/assets/image_517007.jpg" width="474" height="317" /></a></p>  <p>I’d heard <a href="http://science.howstuffworks.com/science-vs-myth/everyday-myths/threw-penny-off-the-empire-state-building.htm" target="_blank">an urban myth</a> about the damage that would be caused by a penny being dropped from the Empire State Building – and heard a similar story yesterday regarding a washer falling during construction that ended up embedded in the concrete floor of London Bridge station, below – but I honestly don’t know enough about the physics involved to know how much was true. I certainly held on tightly to my camera, I can tell you! :-)</p>  <p>And yes, the view was predictably stunning, especially as we’d been luckily enough to make the visit on a clear day:</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2016768bb22bf970b-pi" target="_blank"><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 20px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="The view from the top" border="0" alt="The view from the top" src="/assets/image_270715.jpg" width="474" height="317" /></a></p>
