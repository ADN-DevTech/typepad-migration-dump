<p>While I’m a huge fan of learning and using different programming languages – whether to train your brain to consider different potential solutions to a problem or to improve your job security and your ability to roll with the punches as the employment &amp; technology landscapes shift – you will no doubt have noticed that the vast majority of my posts contain C# code.</p>  <p>A lot of my early programming (both work and fun) was in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC">BASIC</a> (whether <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_BASIC">BBC BASIC</a>, Level II BASIC on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRS-80">TRS-80</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GW-BASIC">GW-BASIC</a>) and some of the more involved internal projects I’ve worked on at Autodesk have used one of VB’s various incarnations. But over the years I’ve also invested a serious amount of time working with C &amp; C++, which have somehow led to a deep, irrational attachment to curly braces and semi-colons. :-)</p>  <p>Anyway, the aim behind most of my posts is to demonstrate the use AutoCAD’s managed API from a mainstream .NET language, and so I’ve focused most of my energy on providing new samples in one particular language rather than spending time converting between them (which I tend to leave as an exercise for those readers who prefer VB.NET).</p>  <p>I do still get the occasional request for code in VB.NET rather than C#, and it occurred to me that it was a good time to mention a few of the resources I usually point people to, to help them with their code conversion efforts.</p>  <p>Firstly, here are some online conversion tools:</p>  <p><a href="http://www.carlosag.net/Tools/CodeTranslator">Carlos Aguilar Mares’ Code Translator</a> (C# &lt;-&gt; VB)     <br /><a href="http://www.kamalpatel.net/ConvertCSharp2VB.aspx">Kamal Patel’s Convert C# to VB.NET</a> (C# –&gt; VB, VB –&gt; C# on its way)     <br /><a href="http://www.developerfusion.com/tools/convert/csharp-to-vb/">developerFusion’s .net code converter</a> (C# &lt;-&gt; VB)</p>  <p>In the past I’ve made use of the first two of these resources via a Visual Studio plugin letting you to <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2006/08/some_cool_copyp.html">copy C# code and paste it as VB</a>, although I didn’t end up bringing this across when I started using VS 2008. Kamal Patel also has a <a href="http://www.kamalpatel.net/Downloads/ConvertCSharp2VB_Offline_Tool.zip">downloadable version of his C# to VB convertor</a> for offline use (provided with full source-code).</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20115712eb2b0970c-pi"><img style="border-right-width: 0px; margin: 0px 20px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" title="Language choice in Reflector" border="0" alt="Language choice in Reflector" align="right" src="/assets/image_787404.jpg" width="220" height="144" /></a>When offline I tend to use <a href="http://www.red-gate.com/products/reflector/">.NET Reflector</a>, which also allows you to decompile a built (and hopefully not obfuscated :-) .NET assembly to C# or VB, among other language options (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygene_(programming_language)">one</a> of which I hadn’t even heard before).</p>  <p>I have found none of these options to be perfect, especially when attempting to convert complex code: it’s pretty rare that some tidy-up isn’t needed on the output, whether related to the way casts are performed, event handlers are added/removed or some other issue. But they do provide a good starting point.</p>  <p>If you have experience with these or other code conversion tools – whether you use them successfully on a regular basis or have knowledge of their respective shortcomings – then please post a comment. I’m sure many of you have more real-world experience of using online code translation tools which would be relevant for this blog’s readership.</p>  <p>Oh, and in case you want to hear the latest news of the strategy around the evolution of VB.NET and C# – in terms of the languages’ “co-evolution” - I recommend watching <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/posts/Charles/Luca-Bolognese-C-and-VBNET-Co-Evolution-The-Twain-Shall-Meet">this post on Channel 9</a>. It’s likely to make you more confident in investing in either C# or VB, knowing that Microsoft is committed to evolving both languages to have similar new features.</p>
