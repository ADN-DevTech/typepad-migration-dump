<p>I mentioned in <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2016/09/ar-mocap-and-drones.html" target="_blank">yesterday’s post</a> that Cyrille and I were heading across to Lausanne to host an <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Switzerland-Augmented-Reality-Meetup/events/233372825/" target="_blank">AR Meetup</a>. It’s our third Meetup for this particular group: the first was in the Autodesk office in Neuchatel, while the second and third have been held at the excellent <a href="http://www.studiobanana.com" target="_blank">Studio Banana</a>. This one was really fun: between Cyrille and I we had three HoloLens devices for people to try, which made for a really interesting event.</p> <p>Cyrille kicked off proceedings with a discussion of AR and VR in general, and where things stand right now.</p> <p>Key Kawamura – from Studio Banana – talked about their <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ostrich-pillow/batband" target="_blank">BATBAND</a> project. BATBAND is a bone induction headset that was successfully funded on Kickstarter and will be shipping very soon. It was fun to see how the project was initiated – and has evolved – and how it fits nicely within the AR theme: bone induction devices allow you to add an audible (rather than visual) overlay to reality, as they don’t block normal sound from reaching your ears.</p> <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201bb0939cfaf970d-pi" target="_blank"><img title="Key talking about BATBAND" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 30px auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="Key talking about BATBAND" src="/assets/image_324019.jpg" width="500" height="281"></a></p> <p>Both Cyrille and I then talked about our various activities related to HoloLens: I talked about my Dancing Robot, Transformer and HoloGuide projects, which Cyrille shared information about the work he’s done on MoCap playback.</p> <p>The most fun part of the evening was when people got to don HoloLens devices and try the various demos…</p> <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b7c8965586970b-pi" target="_blank"><img title="Three people trying HoloLens" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 30px auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="Three people trying HoloLens" src="/assets/image_22468.jpg" width="500" height="281"></a></p> <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b8d2202c36970c-pi" target="_blank"><img title="Lots of engagement from the audience" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 30px auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="Lots of engagement from the audience" src="/assets/image_269832.jpg" width="500" height="281"></a></p> <p>Cyrille managed to work out the kinks in his MoCap playback demo…</p> <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b8d2202c3a970c-pi" target="_blank"><img title="Cyrille getting his MoCap demo up and running" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 30px auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="Cyrille getting his MoCap demo up and running" src="/assets/image_413923.jpg" width="281" height="500"></a></p> <p>... so people could (for instance) wear a MoCap glove and see how it can drive the animation of rigged characters inside HoloLens in realtime.</p> <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b8d2202c43970c-pi" target="_blank"><img title="MoCap   HoloLens" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 30px auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="MoCap   HoloLens" src="/assets/image_410886.jpg" width="281" height="500"></a></p> <p>This could be a game-changer for virtual filmmaking (pioneered by James Cameron for Avatar). Especially when you consider that the <a href="https://neuronmocap.com" target="_blank">Perception Neuron MoCap system</a> that Cyrille showed costs around $1,000. Cyrille is going to record a video showing the results of his MoCap system driving HoloLens models in realtime, which I’ll be sure to share here.</p>
