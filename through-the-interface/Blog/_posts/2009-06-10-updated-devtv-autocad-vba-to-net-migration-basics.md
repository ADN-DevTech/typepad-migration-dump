<p>Stephen Preston has updated his “AutoCAD VBA to .NET Migration Basics” DevTV session.</p>
<p>I’ve updated the links in <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2009/04/devtv-autocad-vba-to-net-migration-basics.html">this previous post</a> to point to the updated DevTV, as the original recording is likely to disappear during the coming days.</p>
<p>Here’s an update from Stephen on what’s new in this version:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>New features of the migration tool:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Automatically adds ‘ObjectDBX’ Type Library to created VB6 project file to ensure Autodesk.AutoCAD.Interop.Common classes are correctly identified (previously these came in as Autodesk.AutoCAD.Interop)</em></li>
<li><em>Extra functionality to post-process your VB Express project for you: <br />- Adds F5 startup application <br />- Adds references to acmgd and acdbmgd dlls from the ObjectARX SDK <br />- Sets project to use .NET Framework 3.5.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em>The first part of the recording is the same, but I’ve added a more detailed explanation of the migration tool functionality, and re-recorded the demos to include event handling.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Please check it out and pass on your feedback to Stephen - the comments he received about the original version were instrumental in steering this update.</p>
