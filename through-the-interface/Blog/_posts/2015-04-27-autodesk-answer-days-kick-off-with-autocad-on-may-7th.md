The ADN team will also be participating in this event, handling any questions you have around AutoCAD’s APIs.</p>  <p>To get answers <u>during</u> the event, it’s as simple as logging into the AutoCAD Community and creating a post on <a href="http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/autocad-answer-day/bd-p/11" target="_blank">the AutoCAD Answer Day board</a> on May 7th.</p>  <p>If you have questions <u>about</u> the event – which I suppose could be considered meta-questions ;-) – be sure to reach out to <a href="https://twitter.com/autodeskhelp" target="_blank">@AutodeskHelp</a> on Twitter.</p>
