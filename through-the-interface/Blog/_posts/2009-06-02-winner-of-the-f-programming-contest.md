<p>Back at the beginning of the year I launched <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2009/01/f-programming-contest.html">a programming contest for using F# with Autodesk products</a>. A few months ago I introduced one of the winning entries showing <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2009/03/customizing-the-display-of-standard-autocad-objects-using-f.html">how to use F# to implement Overrules in AutoCAD 2010</a>. Now I’ve finally got around to unveiling the second winning entry.</p>  <p>And the winner is… drumroll…</p>  <p>Nada Amin, who entered her Master of Engineering project which uses F# with AutoCAD. Here is a description of the project from <a href="http://cag.csail.mit.edu/micado/index.html">the MIT website</a>:</p>  <blockquote>   <p><em><strong>Micado</strong>: an AutoCAD plug-in for programmable microfluidic chips</em></p>    <p><em>Programmable microfluidics, using multi-layer soft lithography, are lab-on-chip systems that can automate biological computations or experiments by integrating a diverse set of biological sensors and by manipulating fluids at the picoliter scale.</em></p>    <p><em>Micado is a Computer-Aided Design (CAD) tool for designing and controlling programmable microfluidics, featuring: </em></p>    <ul>     <li><em>standard and customizable design rules</em></li>      <li><em>automatic routing between control valves and punches</em></li>      <li><em>automatic generation of control instructions and GUI</em></li>   </ul> </blockquote>  <p>The code is hosted <a href="http://code.google.com/p/micado/">here</a> (under which you will find <a href="http://code.google.com/p/micado/source/browse/#svn/trunk/BioStreamFS">the majority of the code having been written in F#</a>).</p>  <p>Nada is now based over in Zürich, so I hope someday to meet with her to discuss the project in person, but in the meantime I’ll be shipping across a copy of <a href="http://www.expert-fsharp.com/">Expert F#</a>.</p>  <p>Congratulations, Nada! :-)</p>
