<p>Now that the dust has settled on the <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2019/04/call-for-proposals-for-au-2019-in-las-vegas-and-germany.html" target="_blank">Call for Proposals process</a> for AU 2019 – and its accompanying Forge DevCon – in Las Vegas, you can <a href="http://au.autodesk.com/speaker-resource-center/call-for-proposals/voting" target="_blank">vote for your favourite sessions</a>. Here’s <a href="https://forge.autodesk.com/blog/voting-open-for-forge-devcon-lasvegas-classes?mktvar002=1065598&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=global-multi-forge-newsletter---may-2019&amp;utm_id=1065598&amp;leadid=37686667&amp;mkt_tok=eyJpIjoiTnprd05qRTVPVFU1T0RJeCIsInQiOiJZaGdoSGVKT2dad1pDVWpLYStQY2Z5ZWVtXC9YaEZlVnpcLzFcLzVTNGxka2gwWXduTXJ5N1RsaGw4TWc0R1VoNXh2Q2dMdTFXODZ3WE52cnBTOVo0K2VXTXZqY2ZpTnRrWkJpM3RIZnFZTkNscUVrK3dpa0g5MUVaQjlaRGdXdkRxanlMWU52MXdKdjF3MXppR3NkWnFnTEE9PSJ9" target="_blank">a blog post on the Forge site</a> explaining how to do so for Forge classes.</p><p>I’ve submitted two, this year. The first is about how Forge developers can build their own products using components we’re publishing from the <a href="http://dasher360.com" target="_blank">Dasher 360</a> codebase. You can find the class by searching for “Dasher”, even if the class is about more than that.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4624ecd200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="169" title="Forge proposal" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Forge proposal" src="/assets/image_548039.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Here’s the text for this first proposal:</p><blockquote><h3><font style="font-weight: bold;">Advanced data visualization using the Forge viewer</font></h3><p>Over the last decade, Autodesk Research has been developing advanced techniques for data visualization in a 3D environment. One example of this is Dasher 360, a Forge-based application that can display sensor data captured by sensors in buildings (or on infrastructure such as bridges) in a 3D context. In recent months we've been working to publish the core components that display this rich 3D data, for instance to spatially locate sensors in a 3D model and to map large amounts of IoT sensor data to the surface of 3D objects via animated heat-maps. This session focuses on how Forge developers can integrate these components into their own applications, delivering first-class visualizations of their customers' data.<ul><li>Understand the history of Autodesk's research into visualization of IoT data in 3D</li><li>See how the Forge viewer supports advanced data visualization</li><li>Identify the open source components published by Autodesk Research</li><li>Learn how to integrate these components into your own Forge application</li></ul></blockquote><p>If we’re lucky, we’ll have some big news to share about the ability for people to make use of more than just components from Dasher 360 (still think source code, just more broadly). But we still have some hurdles to cross before we’re ready to share more on that, for now.<p>The second submission relates to the work we’ve been doing on Project Rediscover, and how you can use it with Dynamo packages such as Space Analysis, Warnamo and Capturefinery, as well as with Refinery. Great to see all the Refinery proposals on the site, by the way. Really awesome stuff!<p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4b0273c200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="179" title="Rediscover proposal" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Rediscover proposal" src="/assets/image_809620.jpg" border="0"></a><p>Here’s the text for the second one:<blockquote><h3><font style="font-weight: bold;">Hands-on with Project Rediscover: generatively designing Autodesk Toronto's office</font></h3><p>Project Discover was the original project that launched Autodesk's work around Generative Design for AEC, leading to the creation of Project Refinery, an optimization engine for Dynamo. It involved the generative design of Autodesk's new office in the MaRS district of Toronto, a showcase for using Generative Design for architectural layout. While this project pre-dated the latest Autodesk tools in this space, Autodesk Research embarked on Project Rediscover to go back and retrofit the original approach to work with Dynamo and Refinery. This session takes a close look at the Project Rediscover graph - which is now publicly available for anyone to load inside Dynamo - and how people might use similar techniques to implement their own Generative Design workflows.<ul><li>Learn the history of Autodesk's research into Generative Design for AEC</li><li>See how Dynamo and Refinery can be used to implement Generative Design workflows in the AEC space</li><li>Understand the workflow implemented by the Project Rediscover graph</li><li>Implement their own Generative Design workflows based on the principles shown</li></ul></blockquote><p>I’d love to have one or the other accepted – we’ll see how things go.<p>Please do take the time to vote on this year’s classes (whether mine or others). There are some great proposals that have been submitted, and the community’s feedback really helps maintain the high calibre of the event but also gives first-time presenters the chance to inject fresh ideas. Both are absolutely critical to the long-term success of any conference.
