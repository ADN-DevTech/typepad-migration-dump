<p>On Wednesday morning I headed up to Stockholm to participate in a Generative Design workshop for <a href="https://www.sweco.se/en/" target="_blank">Sweco</a>. It’s been a long time since I’ve been to Sweden, so it was a fun coincidence that I already had a little taste of the country as I took my train to Zurich airport from Neuchatel.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a49a27a8200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="375" height="500" title="IKEA vending machine in Neuchatel" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="IKEA vending machine in Neuchatel" src="/assets/image_334150.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>IKEA Switzerland has a <a href="https://shilfa.com/switzerland/ikea-creates-a-machine-in-the-center-of-zurichs-central-station/" target="_blank">special vending machine</a> moving between the larger Swiss railway stations as <a href="https://www.facebook.com/IKEA.CH/videos/245229659717939/" target="_blank">part of a promotional event</a>. It was a bit of a shame the machine was out of order, but these things do happen.</p><p>The flight to Stockholm Arlanda was uneventful, and I took the Arlanda Express from the airport to the central station in Stockholm. It’s quick (20 minutes) and comfortable: it even had a business area where you could plug-in and take advantage of the free wifi. Very civilised indeed.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a44c59f3200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="On the Arlanda Express" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="On the Arlanda Express" src="/assets/image_947250.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>I walked from the station to my hotel, the Haymarket. It’s a beautiful (and very trendy) hotel in the historic centre of the city. It’s right on the market square, logically enough.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a49a27ac200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="The view across the square from the Haymarket" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="The view across the square from the Haymarket" src="/assets/image_102841.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>On checking in and walking to my room, I thought something was strange as I made two left turns from the elevator and realised there’s no possible way I could be on the outside of the building. Sure enough, I had a room with no window. I don’t mean a room with a window onto an internal courtyard… I had <em>a room with no window</em>.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a44c59fb200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="My room at the swanky Haymarket" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="My room at the swanky Haymarket" src="/assets/image_901471.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>It turns out that by selecting the cheapest room in our travel booking system I’d managed to book a “cabin” room: presumably named after the fever you get if you stay in one for any serious amount of time. I hadn’t realised such things existed, but there you go.</p><p>The room was very nicely decorated, but it was a little freaky never knowing whether it was day or night. A thought did occur to me… that these rooms would be useful in more northern parts of Sweden, especially at midsummer. But in Stockholm the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=sunset+on+June+21st+in+Stockholm" target="_blank">shortest</a> <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=sunrise+on+June+22nd+in+Stockholm" target="_blank">night</a> of the year is still about 5 hours long, so it’s presumably really about real estate optimisation.</p><p>After catching up on a few too many emails, I headed out for dinner. My Sales colleagues in Sweden had invited me along to have dinner with people from <a href="http://www.afconsult.com/en" target="_blank">ÅF</a>, who had just renewed an enterprise agreement with Autodesk. Before dinner, though, we all tried our hand at shuffleboard.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a49a27b8200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Shuffleboard" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Shuffleboard" src="/assets/image_813794.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Shuffleboard is played on beautiful, long, wooden tables covered with liberal amounts of sawdust.<a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4759052200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="It's harder than it looks" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="It's harder than it looks" src="/assets/image_539660.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>The rules are broadly similar to curling, i.e. like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowls" target="_blank">bowls</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boccia" target="_blank">boccia</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%C3%A9tanque" target="_blank">la pétanque</a>, but aiming at a fixed target – the end of the table – rather than a smaller jack or cochonnet. These are all games that I’ve tried before, unlike shuffleboard.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a44c5a0a200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="The pre-match briefing" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="The pre-match briefing" src="/assets/image_344555.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>I partnered with Simon, who works for ÅF in Belgium.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a44c5a13200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="My partner, Simon, launches a puck" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="My partner, Simon, launches a puck" src="/assets/image_441054.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a44c5a1b200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Watching pucks arrive" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Watching pucks arrive" src="/assets/image_293623.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Here’s my best shot of the night – the only one I did that came anywhere close to the end of the table. You even get an extra point for leaving the puck hanging over the end. It didn’t stay like this for long – it was knocked off by our opposition on their next shot – but it was a nice moment while it lasted.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a49a27c5200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="My best shot" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="My best shot" src="/assets/image_474541.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>The next day we met with Sweco at the Marriott Courtyard. Mathias Näll introduced the workshop, talking about the expectations and the three use-cases for Generative Design they’d brainstormed prior to the workshop and wanted people to explore during the course of the day.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a475905b200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Introduction by Matthias from Sweco" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Introduction by Matthias from Sweco" src="/assets/image_61800.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>I spent some time introducing <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/solutions/refinery-beta" target="_blank">Refinery</a>, showing the <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2018/11/project-refinery-implement-generative-design-workflows-for-aec.html" target="_blank">simple tiling example</a> as well as stepping through the much more complex <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2019/03/the-space-analysis-package-for-dynamo-and-refinery-is-now-available.html" target="_blank">campus layout example</a>. (Many thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/Jos_ols/status/1111192666132365313" target="_blank">Jostein Olsen</a> for sharing this picture.)</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a49a27c9200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Me presenting the campus layout example" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Me presenting the campus layout example" src="/assets/image_420800.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>The star of the day was <a href="https://twitter.com/PaoloESerra" target="_blank">Paolo Serra</a> from Autodesk Consulting, who ran the bulk of the workshop. Paolo is a well-known figure to many of you: he works on all manner of consulting projects, and these days spends a significant amount of time focused on Generative Design.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4759063200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Paolo talks GD" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Paolo talks GD" src="/assets/image_513059.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a475906b200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="The Generative Design Approach" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="The Generative Design Approach" src="/assets/image_145173.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>I really liked the approach Paolo took to introducing the topic and having people think through how best to implement their own GD workflows.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a44c5a2c200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Table 1 in deep discussion" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Table 1 in deep discussion" src="/assets/image_814015.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>The three use-cases – handled by tables 1-3, respectively – related to urban design, volumetric optimization and tenant fit-out. While the various tables all went hands-on to some degree with Dynamo and Refinery, a significant amount of time was spent thinking things through and establishing potential optimization objectives for each workflow.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a49a27d2200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Hands on with Dynamo and Refinery" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Hands on with Dynamo and Refinery" src="/assets/image_316578.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Interestingly, table 3 did some of their prototyping in competitive products (a member of their team was already familiar with Bentley’s Generative Components, so opted to do something with that). For me it really underlines the fact that Generative Design is really about methodology than a specific technology (although I do expect Autodesk to deliver best-in-class, game-changing Generative Design technology to our customers).</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4759077200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Table 3 working on tennant fit-out" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Table 3 working on tennant fit-out" src="/assets/image_517173.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a49a27d6200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Table 2 looked at volumetric optmization" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Table 2 looked at volumetric optmization" src="/assets/image_371864.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>After the workshop finished we headed down to the bar before having dinner at the hotel’s restaurant. The restaurant was called Björk, and was named after the Swedish name for the birch tree rather than the Icelandic singer-songwriter.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a475907f200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Dinner at Bjork" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Dinner at Bjork" src="/assets/image_563674.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4759087200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Relaxing after a long day of GD" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Relaxing after a long day of GD" src="/assets/image_680262.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Paolo and I headed back to the hotel and had another chat with our Sales colleagues before they headed off to their own dinner. The bar at the Haymarket is very nice: I stuck to a few glasses of wine, but the artisanal cocktails looked rather appealing, assuming you didn’t mind waiting the eternity it took for your hipster barman to concoct one. Even the ingredients on display looked delicious.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a475908f200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Overpriced artisanal cocktail, anyone" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Overpriced artisanal cocktail, anyone" src="/assets/image_426038.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a49a27da200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Paolo at the bar" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Paolo at the bar" src="/assets/image_131614.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>I had a really interesting time in Stockholm. I learned a lot about Sweco and the opportunities they see for Generative Design, as well as seeing how our consulting team engages on workshops with customers. I was really encouraged to feel the energy in the room, to see the wealth of potential applications our customers see for this new technology. This is going to be a really fun journey!</p>
