I thought it was a good time to share some of these with this blog’s readers, partly because people may be interested in applying, but also to shine a light on the fact Autodesk hires coders in lots of different locations.</p>  <p>When people email or ask me about positions at Autodesk, I typically suggest they visit <a href="http://autodesk.com/careers" target="_blank">our careers page</a>. This provides access to <a href="https://autodesk.taleo.net/careersection/adsk_gen/jobsearch.ftl" target="_blank">a handy tool</a> listing the various positions open across the company: at the time of writing there are upwards of 500 jobs posted!</p>  <p>While it’s true Autodesk hires most of its engineers in North America, Singapore and China – where we have our largest development offices – we also hire in a number of other locations, around the world. Here’s a handful of the 100+ engineering positions that are currently open, for instance. I’ve filtered on Europe, for emphasis: I’ve also listed what I believe the hiring team to be, as this isn’t always clear from the job postings themselves (these things often aren’t completely clear-cut, either, so I may well have over-simplified). Oh, and some of the below teams – notably in Cambridge and Copenhagen – have multiple positions open.</p>  <ul>   <li><a href="https://autodesk.taleo.net/careersection/adsk_gen/jobdetail.ftl?job=15WD18517" target="_blank">Cambridge, UK</a> – Autodesk Shape Manager </li>    <li><a href="https://autodesk.taleo.net/careersection/adsk_gen/jobdetail.ftl?job=15WD18667" target="_blank">London, UK</a> – Autodesk Within </li>    <li><a href="https://autodesk.taleo.net/careersection/adsk_gen/jobdetail.ftl?job=15WD18429" target="_blank">Copenhagen, Denmark</a> – Autodesk CAM</li>    <li><a href="https://autodesk.taleo.net/careersection/adsk_gen/jobdetail.ftl?job=15WD18295" target="_blank">Stockholm, Sweden</a> – Autodesk Stingray</li>    <li><a href="https://autodesk.taleo.net/careersection/adsk_gen/jobdetail.ftl?job=15WD18537" target="_blank">Darmstadt, Germany</a> – Autodesk VRED </li>    <li><a href="https://autodesk.taleo.net/careersection/adsk_gen/jobdetail.ftl?job=15WD18727" target="_blank">Neuchatel, Switzerland</a> – Autodesk Localization Services </li> </ul>  <p>If you’re looking for something more customer-facing, then you might also try using the tool to filter on jobs in <a href="http://autodesk.com/consulting" target="_blank">Autodesk Consulting</a>: these are often a great fit for people coming in from the broader Autodesk family.</p>  <p>Autodesk has changed a lot, over the years, but it’s still a <a href="http://www.greatplacetowork.net/best-companies/worlds-best-multinationals/the-list" target="_blank">great place to work</a>: in many ways it’s a more interesting company than when I joined, especially when you look at the breadth of technology and talent that has been added. This is one of the reasons I’ve stuck around for so long (more on that in a few weeks – I have a <em>significant</em> anniversary looming…).</p>  <p><font color="#a5a5a5">photo credit: </font><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/30576334@N05/16227346893"><font color="#a5a5a5">Career</font></a><font color="#a5a5a5"> via </font><a href="http://photopin.com"><font color="#a5a5a5">photopin</font></a><font color="#a5a5a5"> </font><a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/"><font color="#a5a5a5">(license)</font></a></p>
