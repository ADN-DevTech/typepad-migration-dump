<p>So yes, it does make sense to switch to Windows 10 if you’re doing HoloLens development.</p> <p>As mentioned in <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2016/07/my-first-hololens-application.html" target="_blank">a recent post</a>, I’d previously not upgraded any of my work PCs to Windows 10, mainly due to lack of formal support from our IT department. Which isn’t in itself a huge concern, but I do need to connect to certain pieces of corporate infrastructure, so this was enough of a deterrent in the absence of a compelling reason to upgrade.</p> <p>The two main potentially compelling reasons I hit while working on this HoloLens project were:</p> <ol> <li>Inability to run the HoloLens emulator</li> <li>Lack of spatial sound support prior to Windows 10</li></ol> <p>The first one wasn’t such an issue – once I got my hands on a physical device, of course – but the second was irritating enough for me to go ahead and upgrade to Windows 10 (with the help and blessing of our local IT team).</p> <p>Immediate benefits? Well, for sure I could install the emulator, which is hosted by Hyper-V. So yes, I’m working on a physical Windows PC, not a Parallels VM in my Mac.</p> <p>I spent a significant amount of time, yesterday, trying to work out how to get the emulator working, though: it would launch – although that took several minutes on the first run – but it kept giving me the following message, after which the launch would complete but no input events would make it to the virtual device:</p> <blockquote> <p>The emulator is unable to connect to the device operating system: <p>Couldn't auto-detect the guest system IP address. <p>Some functionality might be disabled.</p></blockquote> <p>After a bit of Googling, I realised I had to <a href="http://forums.hololens.com/discussion/1100/how-to-fix-hololens-emulator-connectivity-issues" target="_blank">tell Windows Firewall to accept inbound/outbound connects from the XDE.exe application</a> (for me found at <em>C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft XDE\10.0.14342.0\XDE.exe</em>). And I had to enable it for “Public”, as well as “Private” and “Domain” networks, as for some reason my home router was detected as Public. Yes, I should really change that, although I now have to work out how to do so in Windows 10. :-) <p>This happily allowed the emulator to launch much more quickly, as well as having the application itself load and the user input events enabled. You <a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/holographic/using_the_hololens_emulator" target="_blank">control the HoloLens emulator</a> primarily using the WASD and arrow keys for movement/gaze direction, as well as the Enter and Windows keys for air-tap and bloom, respectively. It’s not as cool as a physical device, but it’s not at all bad. <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b8d207f306970c-pi" target="_blank"><img title="HoloLens Emulator" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 30px auto; border-left: 0px; display: block; padding-right: 0px" border="0" alt="HoloLens Emulator" src="/assets/image_444107.jpg" width="500" height="306"></a> <p>For spatial sound I was very happy to see the “MS HRTF Spatializer” option show up in Unity under Edit –&gt; Project Settings –&gt; Audio –&gt; Spatializer Plugin: <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b7c87e2122970b-pi" target="_blank"><img title="Spatial sound" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 30px auto; border-left: 0px; display: block; padding-right: 0px" border="0" alt="Spatial sound" src="/assets/image_789783.jpg" width="378" height="285"></a> <p>So I should be all set to add some spatial sound to the robot model. I’ve therefore been busy scouring the web for servo sounds that I can use for the project: I’d ideally like to have each joint emit a sound while moving, although this may end up being overkill. It might just prove more compelling to have a single servo sound playing when the robot is in any kind of movement. <p>We’ll explore that in an upcoming post.
