<p>It’s Tuesday afternoon and we’re just one day into the main AU 2014 event. Yesterday’s pre-conference event was the ADN DevDay.</p>  <p>It was nice to see my old team (although there were quite a few new faces since I was part of it) take to the stage in a room that was pretty much packed to capacity:</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b8d0a020a6970c-pi" target="_blank"><img title="The ADN team" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 20px auto; border-left: 0px; display: block; padding-right: 0px" border="0" alt="The ADN team" src="/assets/image_522437.jpg" width="410" height="239" /></a></p>  <p>During his keynote our SVP of Industry Strategy and Marketing, Andrew Anagnost, talked about the upcoming business model transformation from perpetual to term-based licensing.</p>  <p>Then followed a number of technical presentations about Autodesk’s PaaS layer – especially the View &amp; Data API – including a fun piece on Virtual Reality, where Jim demoed apps that Cyrille Fauvel and I have written for Google Cardboard:</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b7c7161e71970b-pi" target="_blank"><img title="Jim showing Cardboard" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 20px auto; border-left: 0px; display: block; padding-right: 0px" border="0" alt="Jim showing Cardboard" src="/assets/image_442954.jpg" width="410" height="239" /></a></p>  <p>The afternoon contained information on AutoCAD I/O as well as some other topics that aren’t yet ready to be shared publicly.</p>  <p>There were a number of evening events, including the ADN party at the <a href="http://www.houseofblues.com/lasvegas">House of Blues</a>, the Speaker Social in the <a href="http://delanolasvegas.com/dining/mix-lounge.aspx">miX Lounge</a> and an internal “mixer” between the AutoCAD and Cloud Platform teams in the <a href="http://www.delanolasvegas.com/dining/franklin.aspx">Franklin</a>, so I ended up going to bed a bit later than I should have.</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b8d0a020aa970c-pi" target="_blank"><img title="View from the top of the Delano Hotel" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 20px auto; border-left: 0px; display: block; padding-right: 0px" border="0" alt="View from the top of the Delano Hotel" src="/assets/image_652802.jpg" width="410" height="239" /></a></p>  <p>This morning started with the opening session. If you weren’t able to attend for whatever reason, catch it online here:</p>  <br /><script height="265px" width="470px" src="https://player.ooyala.com/iframe.js#pbid=85cb0f7e010f49e1a94b0ae4f8880222&amp;ec=5jYTBwcDoD6iqhczdUrrHlqtcrk4dfpT"></script>  <br />  <br />  <p>Our CTO, Jeff Kowalski, kicked things off, talking about the need for design to evolve and some of the ways it’s happening.<a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b7c7161e7e970b-pi" target="_blank"><img title="Jeff Kowalski&#39;s keynote" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 20px auto; border-left: 0px; display: block; padding-right: 0px" border="0" alt="Jeff Kowalski&#39;s keynote" src="/assets/image_4469.jpg" width="410" height="239" /></a></p>  <p>Our CEO, Carl Bass, talked about Reality Computing, Fusion 3D and the Spark 3D printing platform: HP will be adopting it for their printer, pretty incredibly. He announced that it’ll soon be possible to use all Autodesk products for a single subscription fee (although the price itself wasn’t mentioned) and that all Autodesk software is now available for students everywhere.</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b8d0a020af970c-pi" target="_blank"><img title="Carl Bass on Spark" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 20px auto; border-left: 0px; display: block; padding-right: 0px" border="0" alt="Carl Bass on Spark" src="/assets/image_428159.jpg" width="410" height="239" /></a></p>  <p>The last speaker, Emily Pilloton, talked about how her organisation, Project H, is engaging with children, involving them in design projects. Really inspiring stuff.</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b8d0a020b9970c-pi" target="_blank"><img title="Emily Pilloton" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 20px auto; border-left: 0px; display: block; padding-right: 0px" border="0" alt="Emily Pilloton" src="/assets/image_953496.jpg" width="410" height="239" /></a></p>  <p>After lunch I joined Cyrille to co-speak about Google Cardboard and then hosted the “AutoCAD APIs – Meet the Experts” session with its all-star panel (talking about my illustrious colleagues – Albert, Randy, Jiri, Joel, Cyrille, Mads, Davis, Lee – rather than myself ;-). Both sessions ended up taking more energy than I’d expected, so my goal for the evening is not to be up too late: I have my main two presentations to deliver tomorrow as well as one more panel session. After that I’ll be able to relax properly.</p>  <p>Thanks to all of you who took the time to say hello during the last couple of days and give me feedback about this blog. I really appreciate it!</p>
