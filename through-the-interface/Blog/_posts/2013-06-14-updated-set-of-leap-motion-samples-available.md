<p>I’ve been beavering away in an attempt to streamline the AutoCAD-Leap Motion integration samples <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2013/06/a-different-approach-for-using-leap-motion-with-autocad.html" target="_blank">I posted last week</a>. Here’s <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/files/LeapMotionIntegration2.zip" target="_blank">the updated project</a>.</p>  <p>This latest set generally gets better results than the last ones, and the LEAPEXT command certainly feels more snappy and accurate. I’m still trying to find out why the controller occasionally stops seeing my fingers – it could well be down to lighting or to the fact I’m using a Plexiglas surface about the device – but I’ll keep looking into it.</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201901d60ca40970b-pi"><img style="display: inline" title="LeapSurface" alt="LeapSurface" src="/assets/image_300729.jpg" width="470" height="470" /></a></p>  <p>I know it’s still likely to be a month or so before most of you get your hands on a device (assuming you have the interest to do so), but I thought I’d keep on posting the samples as I update them, anyway.</p>  <p>A little bird tells me there’s a pretty good chance I’ll be at <a href="http://au.autodesk.com" target="_blank">AU 2013</a> presenting on Leap Motion and Kinect Fusion (two separate sessions), during which a descendant of the above samples are likely to make an appearance.</p>
