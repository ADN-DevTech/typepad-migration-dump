Here’s a quick reminder of how the first DevCon went down, to whet your appetite.</p> <p align="center">&nbsp;</p> <p align="center"><iframe height="281" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0heheSzDHkg?list=PL_6ApchKwjN9CZCqUl4RZrsyDvnTV1Jgb&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" width="500" allowfullscreen></iframe></p> <p align="center">&nbsp;</p> <p>You can already <a href="http://forge.autodesk.com/AttendDevCon" target="_blank">pre-register your interest in attending</a>, but I’m currently more focused on getting potential speakers to sign up to talk. I’ll once again be running the AR/VR track (as well as the associated exhibition area) for the event, so if you feel you have something to share in this space, please go ahead and <a href="http://gems.autodesk.com/d/hvqsm2" target="_blank">submit your proposal</a>. There are a number of other tracks besides mine, of course, so if you have something Forge-related that’s worth sharing with the community, do let us know.</p> <p>Last year we had a number of speakers from AR/VR technology providers – such as Google and Microsoft – but a year is a long time in VR, so I’m expecting this year’s event to include more sessions from people with hands-on experience implementing AR/VR for the industries Autodesk serves. We’ll see!</p>
