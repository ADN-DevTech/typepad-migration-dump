<p>I’ve just heard that the Call for Proposals for Autodesk University 2021 goes out next week on <strong>March 30th</strong>. The CFP period is short – it runs until <strong>April 30th</strong> – so it’s already time to don your thinking caps and consider what topic or topics you’d like to talk about at this year’s AU. Community voting will be possible as soon as the CFP starts, and will run until <strong>May 12th</strong>.</p>
<p>I’m probably going to submit something related to Dasher and /or Project Hyperion, but I need to plan out what that would look like over the coming weeks – and then make sure it happens before the conference itself.</p>
<p>So, if you’d like to be part of this year’s AU event, do have a think about what you’d like to share with people. This year’s speakers will be notified in <strong>early June</strong>, while the event itself will happen towards the end of the year, as usual.</p>
