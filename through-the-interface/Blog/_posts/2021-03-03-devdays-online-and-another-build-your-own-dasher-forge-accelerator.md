<p>I’m currently up in the mountains with my family, enjoying the annual school closure for the kids’ “ski week”. I recognise we’re especially lucky, this year, given that a) Swiss ski resorts are open and b) our kids are at school physically rather than remotely. Spring seems to be hitting early, this year, but even if the snow’s a little soft, the sun is very welcome.</p>
<p>Here’s a shot where we’re sitting at the top of a run as a rescue helicopter takes off (this is never good to see, but it is often impressive):</p>

<p>Yesterday we went to another part of the ski area, doing a bit of snowboarding but also some showshoeing. Here’s a panorama we took while snowshoeing. It was stunning!</p>

<p>While I’m mostly offline this week, I did want to post a few quick reminders about some ongoing and upcoming events.</p>
<p>The first is for <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2021/02/devdays-online-2021.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">DevDays Online</a>, which started yesterday with the opening keynotes. There’s still time to join for the bulk of the content, though.</p>
<p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2026bdec1605f200c-pi" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Jim Quanci at a physical DevDays" border="0" height="241" src="/assets/image_981947.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="Jim Quanci at a physical DevDays" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>The second is the <a href="https://forge.autodesk.com/accelerator-program" rel="noopener" target="_blank">upcoming virtual Forge Accelerator being held from March 22nd-26th</a>. This coincides with the <a href="https://forge.autodesk.com/blog/learn-how-integrate-iot-data-your-model-next-forge-accelerator" rel="noopener" target="_blank">release of the public Beta for the Forge Viewer Data Visualization extensions (on March 22nd)</a>. This is the second Accelerator focused on “Project Hyperion”, which is the Forge team’s effort to build <a href="https://dasher360.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Dasher</a>-like capabilities into the platform: <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2020/11/build-your-own-dasher-during-the-upcoming-forge-accelerator.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the first was back in December</a>, and the Forge viewer team has been working hard to address the valuable feedback received during the event. They’re now getting ready for this functionality to be made available more widely.</p>
