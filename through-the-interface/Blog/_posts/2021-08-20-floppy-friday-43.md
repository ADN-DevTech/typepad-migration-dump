<p><a href="https://youtu.be/jKRj97obClA" rel="noopener" target="_blank">This week’s episode</a> is an interesting one, in that it includes a couple of Italian games that I’ve found no reference to on the interwebs. And both were really fun to play!</p>
<p>The first was Miami Race (that’s right – not Vice, but Race), which was a very playable (i.e. fun and easy) racing game, while the second was called Pogo, which was a puzzle platformer with some really interesting 3D rotational effects. We then went on to play <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/mandroid" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Mandroid</a> and the first text adventure we’ve tried in this series, <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/c64/smashed" rel="noopener" target="_blank">S*M*A*S*H*E*D</a>. We then tried – but ultimately failed – to load a game called Repel.</p>

<p>As this is really “obscure games week”, I couldn’t find any reviews for these games, but I did manage to track down cover art for two of them.</p>
