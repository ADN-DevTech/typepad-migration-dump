<p>For the last week or so I’ve been busy making sure <a href="http://dasher360.com" target="_blank">Dasher</a> works well with multiple themes. You can see the progress <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2020/03/supporting-multiple-visual-themes-in-a-forge-application-using-the-autodesk-human-interface-guidelines.html" target="_blank">across</a> <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2020/03/using-the-hig-to-implement-a-light-mode-in-a-forge-application.html" target="_blank">these</a> <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2020/03/changing-hig-themes-at-runtime-in-a-forge-application.html" target="_blank">posts</a>.</p><p>I’m not quite ready for a full unveiling, but it should go live at some point in the next week, give or take. In the meantime, here are some screenshots of the main page (you’ll be able to select the theme either as you enter Dasher via the front page or from within the application’s settings UI, which is integrated into the Forge viewer’s).</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4f5b02e200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="312" title="Dasher blue Pier 9" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Dasher blue Pier 9" src="/assets/image_806513.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2025d9b403b25200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="312" title="Dasher gray factory" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Dasher gray factory" src="/assets/image_164608.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2025d9b403b2d200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="312" title="Dasher dark gray floor" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Dasher dark gray floor" src="/assets/image_381164.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a51a5980200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="312" title="Dasher light gray robot" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Dasher light gray robot" src="/assets/image_90481.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>One of the big-ticket items in this coming release will be the new timeline: we’ll be really interested in usability feedback on this new component, in particular. We’ve worked hard to build something that’s a lot more powerful and flexible than our current implementation, and in time may well be used elsewhere, too. But more on all that in an upcoming post.</p><p>(A reminder: Project Dasher is an ongoing research project, so this is not a full commercial release. You’ll be able to try the public demo with the NEST model, not with your own model and data.)</p>
