<p>For those of you unable to attend <a href="http://au.autodesk.com" target="_blank">AU 2013</a> in person, the keynote sessions and a small number of this year’s classes <a href="http://au.autodesk.com/au-online/live-stream" target="_blank">will be streamed live</a>. And they’re free to attend: you just need to <a href="http://au.autodesk.com/au-online/overview" target="_blank">be registered with AU Online</a>.</p>  <p>I’m lucky to be presenting one of only 11 classes that are scheduled to be broadcast over the web as well as having a live audience: it seems <a href="http://au.autodesk.com/au-online/live-stream/reality-capture-inside-autocad-using-kinect-fusion" target="_blank">my Kinect Fusion session</a> is the only developer-centric class that’s been selected for this year’s AU Online, which is quite the honour. Hopefully I’ll do it justice!</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2019b00f09ae5970c-pi" target="_blank"><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; margin: 20px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="AU Online LIVE sessions for Tuesday and Wednesday" border="0" alt="AU Online LIVE sessions for Tuesday and Wednesday" src="/assets/image_629668.jpg" width="469" height="434" /></a></p>  <p>A good piece of related news is that the class is scheduled for early morning, local time (<a href="http://au.autodesk.com/content/dam/au/centers/experience-au-online/docs/ics/Reality-Capture-Inside-Autodesk-AutoCAD-Using-Kinect-Fusion.ics" target="_blank">8am Pacific on Wednesday, December 4, 2013</a>), which means <strike>my family</strike> people in Europe will be able to attend without getting up in the middle of the night (I should be able to double the online attendance if I make a few calls, I suspect ;-). The class will be available on-demand after the fact, so don’t worry if the timing doesn’t work for you. And people not attending live and submitting questions to be picked up by my trusted moderator, Stephen Preston, should feel free to reach out by email or blog comments with any questions, after the fact.</p>  <p>A final note: I’ve had some people who will be attending AU reach out by email to ask if we can meet up. This is great – please feel free to <a href="mailto:kean.walmsley@autodesk.com" target="_blank">drop me a line</a> if you’d like to find some time to sit down for a few minutes in Las Vegas. The same is true for exhibitors: if you let me know your booth number, I’ll be sure to come by and introduce myself.</p>
