<p>In the last post we took a look at <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2023/09/autodesk-devcon-2023-in-munich-part-1.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the first day of last week's Autodesk DevCon in Munich</a>. Today’s post focuses on the second day and overall impressions of the event.</p>
<p>For me day 2 of the DevCon started with a short U-Bahn trip from Goetheplatz to Harras.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_529678.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Goetheplatz U-Bahn" src="/assets/image_529678.jpg" alt="Goetheplatz U Bahn" width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>From the U-Bahn exit, I instinctively started walking the wrong way - I’d like to say this is easily done, but anyway - but luckily a fellow DevCon attendee coming from the other direction helped me realize my mistake. I do love the Autodesk developer community!</p>

<p>The general session filled up quickly, once again. Rather than sitting near the front, this time I found a convenient coffee table near the back.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_607355.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Peter Schlipf having his photo taken" src="/assets/image_607355.jpg" alt="Peter Schlipf having his photo taken" width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Emile was once again master of ceremonies and recapped the previous day's general session before introducing the next topics.<a href="/assets/image_865242.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Emile recapping and introducing the agenda" src="/assets/image_865242.jpg" alt="Emile recapping and introducing the agenda" width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Ben Cohran hosted a very interesting panel with Frank Neuberg and Caner Dolas.<a href="/assets/image_133808.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="A panel with Frank and Caner" src="/assets/image_133808.jpg" alt="A panel with Frank and Caner" width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>There were a number of helpful announcements, including this slide on the APS SDK roadmap.<a href="/assets/image_151839.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="The SDK roadmap" src="/assets/image_151839.jpg" alt="The SDK roadmap" width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>I was happy to see Tandem introduced to the broader audience ahead of Jan Liska's break-out session.<a href="/assets/image_819830.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Emile introducing Tandem" src="/assets/image_819830.jpg" alt="Emile introducing Tandem" width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>This slide nearly got some applause (I know this from speaking to some folks afterwards). It seems to be a very important topic for our desktop developers.<a href="/assets/image_227685.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Some excitement from the audience for this slide" src="/assets/image_227685.jpg" alt="Some excitement from the audience for this slide" width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>It was really nice to have such a large audience focused on learning about our platform technology.<br /><a href="/assets/image_588283.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="A full room" src="/assets/image_588283.jpg" alt="A full room" width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Then came the moment I'd been waiting for, and to some degree dreading.</p>
<p>Jim Quanci, my friend and mentor, is retiring in the spring and this would be his last European DevCon. (It's one of the reasons I chose to come across - I was not going to miss this, even if I had to pay for my own trip.)<a href="/assets/image_363214.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Jim's farewell hug" src="/assets/image_363214.jpg" alt="Jim s farewell hug" width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>I have worked closely with Jim since the late 90s and reported to him directly for several years from 2005 to 2012 (give or take). I have learned so much from Jim, over the years: how to prioritize what's best for the company over what's best for your organization, how to speak openly and frankly about technology in a way that inspires trust, how to engage with an audience, how to manage a large team… the list goes on.</p>
<p>I choked up a little (actually a lot) as Jim bade farewell to his community. I know I’ll get to see Jim at AU and beyond - he promises me he’ll be across in Europe for a visit before too long - but this was the last big developer event I’ll see him at. It’s been an honour and a privilege, Jim. May the wind be always at your back.<a href="/assets/image_779102.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="I'm going to miss this man" src="/assets/image_779102.jpg" alt="I m going to miss this man" width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>That was the end of the general session. From there on out it was break-outs. These were the ones I attended (I would have also attended the Fusion session but ended up having an interesting discussion about robotics).<a href="/assets/image_51375.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Day 2 break-outs" src="/assets/image_51375.jpg" alt="Day 2 break outs" width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>My old friend Jan Liska is now a Developer Advocate in the Tandem team and presented the product and its platform.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_513146.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Jan introducing Tandem" src="/assets/image_513146.jpg" alt="Jan introducing Tandem" width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_705795.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="The Tandem stack" src="/assets/image_705795.jpg" alt="The Tandem stack" width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>I'm always happy to see the influence of our work on Project Dasher, in this case through Tandem’s volumetric heatmaps.<a href="/assets/image_685100.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Demoing heatmaps" src="/assets/image_685100.jpg" alt="Demoing heatmaps" width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>And of course lots of sensor data.<a href="/assets/image_372709.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Sensor data" src="/assets/image_372709.jpg" alt="Sensor data" width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Jan posted links to the <a href="https://github.com/autodesk-tandem" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tandem samples</a>, which I'm sure will be helpful to folks.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_482814.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Tandem samples" src="/assets/image_482814.jpg" alt="Tandem samples" width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>As well as a <a href="https://autodesk-tandem.github.io/tandem-sample-emb-viewer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">testbed for Tandem's REST API</a>.<a href="/assets/image_429081.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Tandem testbed" src="/assets/image_429081.jpg" alt="Tandem testbed" width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Michael Beale showed a <a href="https://github.com/wallabyway/powerBI-tandem-viewer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sample project integrating PowerBI with Tandem</a> - a hot topic for people building dashboards and analytics.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_913343.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Michael talking Tandem and PowerBI" src="/assets/image_913343.jpg" alt="Michael talking Tandem and PowerBI" width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Michael also gave some additional demos in the context of a very nice-looking facility. Maybe it’s the new Snowdon Towers sample Revit model that I’ve heard so much about?<a href="/assets/image_224767.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="That's a pretty facility" src="/assets/image_224767.jpg" alt="That s a pretty facility" width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>The next break-out I attended was on building Forma extensions, presented by Håkon Dissen.<a href="/assets/image_323331.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Extensions in Forma" src="/assets/image_323331.jpg" alt="Extensions in Forma" width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>We had an internal hackathon earlier this year where I built a rudimentary generator, but it’s good to see that the mechanism is <a href="https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/forma/v1/developers_guide/intro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">now documented publicly</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_787249.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Introduction to generators" src="/assets/image_787249.jpg" alt="Introduction to generators" width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>For the next session I was tempted to attend Cyrille Fauvel's AutoCAD update, but I opted to see Jim in action one last time with his <em>Dancing with Elephants</em> session.<a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202c8d39e0e79200d-pi" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><br /></a></p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_734428.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Dancing with Elephants" src="/assets/image_734428.jpg" alt="Dancing with Elephants" width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>This presentation is a must-see for anyone curious about the dynamics between smaller companies and larger platform providers (Jim's insights are true for small companies working with Autodesk but also for Autodesk working with - say - AWS or Microsoft).<a href="/assets/image_778254.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Know thyself" src="/assets/image_778254.jpg" alt="Know thyself" width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>One really important slide focused on the way people in different positions are measured. Understanding this is extremely important for nurturing beneficial relationships with platform providers.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_425448.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Incentives are everything" src="/assets/image_425448.jpg" alt="Incentives are everything" width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Jim also talked about different approaches to dancing with elephants, whether you’re off to the sides, picking up leftovers or running out in front. Each of these strategies comes with its own risks.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_446098.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Where are you relative to the elephant" src="/assets/image_446098.jpg" alt="Where are you relative to the elephant" width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>The last break-out I attended was on the APS Viewer.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_755912.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="PowerBI with the Viewer this time" src="/assets/image_755912.jpg" alt="PowerBI with the Viewer this time" width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Once again it was extremely well attended.<a href="/assets/image_151378.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Standing room only" src="/assets/image_151378.jpg" alt="Standing room only" width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Petr Broz told a great anecdote about his Dad using the Autodesk Viewer for a chemical plant project. He also talked about how the Viewer strategy is on enabling better large model performance through selective loading or other performance optimizations.<a href="/assets/image_619623.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Large model support" src="/assets/image_619623.jpg" alt="Large model support" width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Michael Beale shared some of his great work on integrating 3D tiles of point clouds data into the APS Viewer.<a href="/assets/image_772178.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="3D tiles are awesome" src="/assets/image_772178.jpg" alt="3D tiles are awesome" width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>During the last session I went outside to chat with people on a variety of topics before jumping on a few calls.<a href="/assets/image_358863.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Autodeskers chatting outside" src="/assets/image_358863.jpg" alt="Autodeskers chatting outside" width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>All in all it was a fantastic DevCon: the venue was perfect, as was pretty much every aspect of the organization. There was a decent mix of strategic and technical content, and it was really great to catch up with so many old friends. I very much hope there’s another in 2024!</p>
<p>Over dinner I managed to catch up with some former Autodeskers - all of whom worked in Neuchatel before settling in Munich - which was a lovely end to my quick trip to the city. It was great to see you again, Lisa, Markus, Petra and Marion!</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_684507.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Dinner with old friends" src="/assets/image_684507.jpg" alt="Dinner with old friends" width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>The following morning I walked back to the central bus station to take a very early bus back to Zurich and then a train back to Neuchatel. I’m very glad I made it across for Jim’s last DevCon, although I admit I’m still coming to terms with this fact.</p>
