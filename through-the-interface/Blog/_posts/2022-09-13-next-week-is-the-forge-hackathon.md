<p>Back at the beginning of August <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2022/08/register-today-for-this-years-forge-hackathon.html" target="_blank">I mentioned</a> the upcoming <a href="https://forge.autodesk.com/hackathon" target="_blank">Forge Hackathon</a> which precedes Autodesk University 2022. Well, the upcoming has become the immediate, and next week it’s happening!</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202a2eed5eaa1200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="312" title="Forge Hackathon" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Forge Hackathon" src="/assets/image_205151.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>So if you’ve been debating whether or not to join the event, it’s time to make a decision and (hopefully) register. It’s a great opportunity to showcase your development team’s capabilities, to create something genuinely novel using Forge, or simple to kick back and have some fun. Or ideally all of the above. :-)</p><p>(See <a href="https://forge.autodesk.com/blog/save-date-2022-forge-hackathon" target="_blank">this blog post</a> for a reminder of the prize categories and judging criteria.)</p>
