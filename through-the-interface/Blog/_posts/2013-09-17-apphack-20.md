I attended for much of Friday – and was able to connect with a few people via private chat, which was nice – but due to my plans for the weekend I unfortunately couldn’t attend for longer.</p>  <p>Anyway, now that the Portathon has finished it’s time to talk about another app-related event, <a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/autocad/announcing-apphack-20.html" target="_blank">APPHACK 2.0</a>.</p>  <p>At last year’s AU, we held our <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2012/10/apphack-au-2012.html" target="_blank">first</a> <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2012/11/last-chance-to-sign-up-for-the-apphack.html" target="_blank">external</a> <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2012/11/au2012.html" target="_blank">APPHACK</a> event, and it’s being run again at AU 2013, with a few tweaks. The prizes are broadly similar to those for the first APPHACK event – although this time an additional contribution is being made towards the finalists’ travel costs, which I’m sure will be welcome – and once again for apps to be eligible they shouldn’t have been made available commercially during the last 5 years.</p>  <p>The changes to the format are important to note:</p>  <ul>   <li>The products you can submit apps against have been extended beyond <strong>AutoCAD</strong> to include <strong>Inventor</strong>, <strong>Revit</strong> and <strong>BIM 360 Glue</strong>.</li>    <ul>     <li>The theme has also been extended to “<em>Connecting Autodesk to the Cloud</em>” (last year it was AutoCAD rather than Autodesk).</li>   </ul>    <li>The event is being held in rounds, with the first round – which basically involves registering and submitting a proposal describing your app – running <strong>until October 11th </strong>(see <a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/autocad/apphack-20-summary-of-key-dates.html" target="_blank">here for the other important dates</a>).</li>    <ul>     <li>10 entrants then progress to the second round, where they need to finish up coding and submit a 5-minute demo video for evaluation.</li>      <li>5 finalists will be selected from these to attend the APPHACK event at AU on December 2nd (<a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/autocad/apphack-20-judging-criteria.html" target="_blank">here are the judging criteria</a> for the various rounds).</li>   </ul> </ul>  <p>Non-ADN members are eligible if based in the US, but otherwise ADN Standard and Professional members are eligible to compete from the world over. Of course there are a few more rules than that, so <a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/autocad/apphack-20-competition-official-rules.html" target="_blank">be sure to read them thoroughly</a>.</p>  <p>I’ll certainly be attending the final on December 2nd in Las Vegas – and will hopefully be invited back onto the judges panel, as I had a blast, last year – so I’m looking forward to meeting the finalists there!</p>
