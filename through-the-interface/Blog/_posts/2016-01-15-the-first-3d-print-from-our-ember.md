<p>My friend and colleague, Fernando Oliveira, had the honour of printing the first object from the <a href="https://ember.autodesk.com/overview" target="_blank">Ember printer</a> we have in the Autodesk Neuchâtel office. To capture the moment, I decided to take a few snaps that I’ll share here.</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201bb08acabc4970d-pi" target="_blank"><img title="Fernando at the controls" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 30px auto; border-left: 0px; display: block; padding-right: 0px" border="0" alt="Fernando at the controls" src="/assets/image_142541.jpg" width="504" height="285" /></a></p>  <p>The design work was all done in Fusion 360. The design is a logo comprising of Fernando’s daughter’s initials.</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201bb08acabcc970d-pi" target="_blank"><img title="The design inside Fusion 360" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 30px auto; border-left: 0px; display: block; padding-right: 0px" border="0" alt="The design inside Fusion 360" src="/assets/image_366569.jpg" width="504" height="285" /></a></p>  <p>The printing process was managed by <a href="https://ember.autodesk.com/overview#software" target="_blank">Print Studio</a>, part of the <a href="https://spark.autodesk.com/" target="_blank">Spark platform</a>.</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201bb08acabd8970d-pi" target="_blank"><img title="The print - with support - inside Print Studio" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 30px auto; border-left: 0px; display: block; padding-right: 0px" border="0" alt="The print - with support - inside Print Studio" src="/assets/image_803930.jpg" width="504" height="285" /></a></p>  <p>I included the below shot – despite it being out of focus and not especially flattering – because it gives a view from our corner lab across <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2015/10/autodesk-neuchatel-gets-a-new-shared-space.html" target="_blank">the new coffee area</a> in the office. Employees were recently asked to suggest names for the new lab… I somehow knew my own suggestion (“The Smoking Corner”) wasn’t going to be selected. The winning suggestion was “LaBox”, which is OK, too. :-)</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201bb08acabe0970d-pi" target="_blank"><img title="Looking out across the new coffee area" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 30px auto; border-left: 0px; display: block; padding-right: 0px" border="0" alt="Looking out across the new coffee area" src="/assets/image_204813.jpg" width="504" height="285" /></a></p>  <p>Fernando sensibly donned gloves to remove the print. We were both quite excited to see how it came out… one thing about printing in black resin: you don’t know it’s working until the very end!</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b7c807fd21970b-pi" target="_blank"><img title="Removing the print" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 30px auto; border-left: 0px; display: block; padding-right: 0px" border="0" alt="Removing the print" src="/assets/image_109383.jpg" width="504" height="285" /></a></p>  <p>The printed resin is both cured and cleaned using alcohol (yes, just one of its many uses ;-).</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201bb08acabe4970d-pi" target="_blank"><img title="The results" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 30px auto; border-left: 0px; display: block; padding-right: 0px" border="0" alt="The results" src="/assets/image_293135.jpg" width="504" height="285" /></a></p>  <p>Now that Fernando has broken ground with the new printer, I’m looking forward to giving it a try, myself. It won’t be until I get back from next week’s developer event in Munich, though: we have the European DevDay on Monday, followed by a cloud accelerator throughout the rest of the week. Should be fun!</p>
