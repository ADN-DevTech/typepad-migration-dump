<p>There’s a new Autodesk site that many of you will find interesting: <a href="https://tech.autodesk.com/" target="_blank">tech.autodesk.com</a> has just launched, a showcase for technology and engineering at Autodesk.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202a308e05b40200c-pi"><img width="500" height="423" title="tech.autodesk.com" style="margin: 30px auto; float: none; display: block;" alt="tech.autodesk.com" src="/assets/image_562903.jpg"></a></p><p>The site will be a great resource for people interested in learning about the technical work performed by our employees and will also be a way for Autodesk engineering talent to connect with the outside world. I’m really looking forward to seeing what our development teams share through this new mechanism.</p><p>The site has linked to blogs written by a few of the company’s technologists, including this one.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202a2eed660cc200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="442" height="375" title="Meet Our Technologists" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Meet Our Technologists" src="/assets/image_387913.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>That was very nice to see, I admit.</p><p>Many thanks – and a big congratulations! – to Aliza Carpio, who I work with on our Open Source committee, for driving the initiative forward and getting this valuable site built.</p>
