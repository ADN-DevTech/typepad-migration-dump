The first was back in 2008, and the 17th was last week.</p>

<p>As is always the case with such things, some are better than others. If you have a particular favourite that stands out (in many ways I still really like my post from 2010, which turned out to be quite prescient from a technology perspective and thankfully less so from a social one) please do post a comment or send me a note.</p>
