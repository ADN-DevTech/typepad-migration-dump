<p>After initially holding DevCamps annually in <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2007/07/coming-in-septe.html" target="_blank">2007</a> and <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2008/05/devcamps-2008-.html" target="_blank">2008</a>, we’ve now settled down to the more regular rhythm of every other year (the last set was in <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2010/04/countdown-to-devcamps-2010.html" target="_blank">2010</a>). Which means, of course, it’s time to do them again. :-)</p>  <p>As already reported by <a href="http://geospatial.blogs.com/geospatial/2012/02/autodesk-devcamps-in-june.html" target="_blank">Geoff</a>, <a href="http://heidihewett.blogs.com/my_weblog/2012/02/index.html" target="_blank">Heidi</a>, <a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2012/02/aec-devcamp-coming-up-again.html" target="_blank">Jeremy</a> and <a href="http://autodesk.blogs.com/between_the_lines/2012/02/heads-up-on-autodesk-devcamps-june-2012.html" target="_blank">Shaan</a>, here is some information regarding this year’s DevCamps:</p>  <blockquote>   <p><b>AEC</b></p>    <p><em>When:</em> June 6-7, with a DevLab on June 8</p>    <p><em>Where:</em> Boston, Massachusetts – near Autodesk’s AEC Division headquarters</p>    <p><em>Cost:</em> early bird discount fee of US $500 valid to April 30, 2012, thereafter US $600 </p>    <p><b>Manufacturing</b></p>    <p><em>When:</em> June 13-14, with a DevLab on June 15</p>    <p><em>Where:</em> Portland, Oregon – near Autodesk’s Manufacturing Division headquarters</p>    <p><em>Cost:</em> early bird discount fee of US $500 valid to April 30, 2012, thereafter US $600 </p> </blockquote>  <p>You probably don’t need me to extoll the virtues of these events – hopefully those are evident from the other posts – but I will just say that they are really great opportunity both to acquire technical knowledge and to network, whether with other people interested in software development, with members of the ADN team, with the product managers and software developers defining and building our products, or even with Autodesk’s divisional heads.</p>  <p>A particular area of focus, this year, will be on web and mobile technology, which reflects the shift our industry is going through. That doesn’t mean we’ll have less focus on our desktop software, though: expect excellent information on developing for those, too, aimed both at beginners and experts.</p>  <p>To stay abreast of the event details as they get nailed down (such as the specific agenda, registration information, etc.) be sure to email <a href="mailto:melrose.ross@autodesk.com" target="_blank">Melrose Ross</a>, stating your full name and the company name.</p>
