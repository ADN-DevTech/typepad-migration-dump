<p>One year ago Autodesk held our <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2015/04/autodesk-answer-days-kick-off-with-autocad-on-may-7th.html" target="_blank">first ever Answer Day</a> for people to get answers regarding the use of AutoCAD (and its APIs). While I didn’t participate in the original event, myself, I was pleased to see a new approach being tried for connecting users of our products with the people who create them.</p> <p>You can think of these Answer Days as a kind of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reddit#IAmA_and_AMA" target="_blank">AMA</a> for Autodesk software. The original event paved the way for several others and all have proven to be worthwhile: not just for Autodesk customers struggling with frustrating probems but for the Autodesk employees who help them.</p> <p>Based on the success of these product-specific Answer Days, on Wednesday of next week (<strong>May 18th, 2016</strong>) we’ll be holding our first <a href="http://autode.sk/answerdays" target="_blank">“Big Bang” Answer Day</a> covering multiple products. Autodesk employees from various departments will be on hand to answer your questions in the following forums from <strong>6am to 6pm Pacific Time</strong>:</p> <ul> <li><a href="http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/autocad/ct-p/8">AutoCAD</a> <li><a href="http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/autocad-civil-3d/ct-p/66">AutoCAD Civil 3D</a> <li><a href="http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit/ct-p/2003">Revit</a> <li><a href="http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/inventor/ct-p/70">Inventor</a> <li><a href="http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/vault/ct-p/2004">Vault</a> <li><a href="http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/maya/ct-p/area-c2">Maya</a> <li><a href="http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/3ds-max/ct-p/area-c1">3ds Max</a></li></ul> <p>I’ll be answering questions posted to the AutoCAD API forums (primarily the <a href="http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/net/bd-p/152" target="_blank">.NET</a> forum) from 6am to 9am Pacific (which is 3pm-6pm, here in Central Europe).</p> <p>To add a little spice to the event, I’ve decided to host a 45-minute Google Hangout from 7am Pacific (4pm in Europe) on that day, during my participation. You can join me online and ask me questions via video or otherwise see me try to answer questions that have been submitted in advance. And if this proves useful then maybe it’s something that happens more regularly… we’ll see.</p> <p>You can <a href="https://plus.google.com/events/c9lru7ai8o806s6p01vlccok1uk" target="_blank">sign up to attend via the event page</a>, or just <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9WUVcuyPJI" target="_blank">stream it via YouTube</a>. In fact, here’s the stream, in case you prefer to watch it here. :-)</p><br> <p><iframe height="284" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/K9WUVcuyPJI" frameborder="0" width="500" allowfullscreen></iframe></p><br> <p>I’ve received my question-answering T-shirt (yes, apparently that’s a thing) and I’m ready to go.</p> <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b8d1e26af0970c-pi" target="_blank"><img title="Ready for the Big Bang Answer Day" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 30px auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="Ready for the Big Bang Answer Day" src="/assets/image_838507.jpg" width="304" height="537"></a></p> <p>See you in the forums – or in the Hangout – next week!</p>
