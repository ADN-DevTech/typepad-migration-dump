<p>The recordings and other materials prepared for the two classes I helped present at AU 2023 are now available online.</p>
<p>In today’s post I’ll point you to the first class, entitled "<a href="https://conferences.autodesk.com/flow/autodesk/au2023/sessioncatalog/page/inperson/session/1686766044586001Z9UY" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Channeling Minecraft to Analyze Architectural Spaces with VASA and Dynamo</a>". This one was one of the first sessions of AU 2023, and had a very good crowd in attendance.</p>
<p>Here are a few photos from the live session. Thanks again to Fernando Malard for snapping them.</p>

<p>I already posted a quick summary of the content (without audio) - here that is again.</p>

<p>Here is the material posted for <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/autodesk-university/class/Channeling-Minecraft-to-Analyze-Architectural-Spaces-with-VASA-and-Dynamo-2023">the class on the AU website</a>:</p>

</ul>
<p>Do bear in mind that the class recording was made some time before the in-person delivery: there are a few demos - particularly those relating to Autodesk Forma - that evolved quite a bit after the recording was made. Information has been posted on this blog about those additional capabilities, though. On the other hand, I was lucky to have Rhys Goldstein participate in the recording - despite not being able to travel to AU - so the online version is certainly better in that important respect.</p>
