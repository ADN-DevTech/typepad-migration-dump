<p>A member of my team recently asked me to extend this blog's standard RSS feed to include more than 10 entries: he wanted a feed that contained all the entries ever posted to &quot;Through the Interface&quot;. It turns out he uses Outlook 2007's RSS capability to download the full contents of items in an RSS feed, so he can then use his Outlook-integrated search capabilities to search his various email archives - as well as this blog's contents - whenever he's researching a technical query. He had a number of the earlier posts missing from Outlook and wanted the full collection.</p>

<p>I ended up creating <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/allposts.xml">a new RSS feed containing all posts</a> specifically for this purpose. If you're new to &quot;Through the Interface&quot; and wish to keep an offline archive of the blog's contents, then this feed may prove useful to you.</p>

<p>On a related note, a very cool tool I use to archive this blog's content is <a href="http://www.httrack.com/">HTTrack</a>. This tool sucks down the content from a particular URL or set of URLs, follows the various links and remaps them to relative links on your local hard-drive. Very cool, indeed. In case you're wondering why I bother... I take the archive created by this tool and transfer it across to a colleague in Shanghai, who extracts it on an internal server for our China-based Engineering teams to access. TypePad blogs are apparently all blocked by the Great Firewall of China, and that's the way we've chosen to work around this problem, for now.</p>

<p>One final reminder, if you're interested in catching up on old posts... as mentioned <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2008/08/master-list-of.html">previously</a>, a <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/posts.html">master post index</a> is now available in this blog's right-hand navigation sash. This proved immensely popular the day it was launched (that day had the highest ever number of page-hits on this blog, although a few days since have now approached it), but I suspect that people have generally now forgotten about it: it's a relatively inconspicuous grey-on-grey link, after all.</p>
