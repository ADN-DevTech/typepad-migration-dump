<p>As mentioned in <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2007/08/creating-an-ins.html">this previous post</a>, tomorrow we're delivering a fun (and free!) AutoCAD development-oriented webcast entitled &quot;AutoCAD: 10 easy ways to crash your AutoCAD addin&quot;. In case it's not obvious, the point is to highlight issues to avoid in your code, rather than showing you how to introduce critical bugs. :-)</p>

<p>Check <a href="http://www.autodesk.com/apitraining">here</a> for our overall API schedule, or go <a href="http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/item?id=6703509&amp;siteID=123112&amp;cname=AutoCAD: 10 easy ways to crash your AutoCAD addin, Webcast, Oct 04 2007, 860">here to register directly</a>. These sessions are typically held at the end of the working day in Europe (5pm CEST) which is the beginning of the day on the West Coast of the US (8am PDT).</p>

<p>I will, of course, post a link to the recording, once it's available.</p>
