<p>It’s that time of year again: the <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/autodesk-university/conference/call-for-proposals" target="_blank">Call for Proposals for AU 2023</a> is now open!</p><p>This year’s event is back in Las Vegas – it’s being held at The Venetian from November 13th-15th. Interestingly this is a Monday to Wednesday slot, presumably to avoid overlap with the <a href="https://www.f1lasvegasgp.com/" target="_blank">Las Vegas Formula 1 Grand Prix</a>. I expect it’s going to be very hard to find a hotel room in Las Vegas after AU is over, this year!</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202b7519fee00200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="333" title="Victoria Via from Architects FORA, presenting at a Theater Talk on radical approaches to fostering team culture.

" src="/assets/image_685690.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>I always find that the best way to be sure to get to AU is to get a class accepted, something that didn’t happen for me last year.</p><p>I still managed to get there, though: in fact I ended up spending most of my waking hours during the last event in the Exhibit Hall, which was a lot of fun but not necessarily something I want to repeat again this year.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202b7519fee0c200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="333" title="AU 2022 Expo Hall" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="AU 2022 Expo Hall" src="/assets/image_264533.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Given the sensitivity around <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2022/09/human-centric-building-design.html" target="_blank">what I’m currently working on</a>, it seems unlikely I’ll be able to submit a class related to that, so we’ll see if there’s something else I can talk about. It might be worth re-submitting <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2022/04/three-au-proposals-to-vote-for-and-a-deadline-reminder.html" target="_blank">one of the proposals from last year</a>, as I still think they’d be interesting topics for people to hear about. We’ll see.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202b7517b958e200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="333" title="AU 2022 General Session" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="AU 2022 General Session" src="/assets/image_756322.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>So it’s time to get those creative juices flowing, and submit your – hopefully – winning proposals today. You have until May 15th, <strike>but submitting sooner means more time for community voting</strike> (and you can still edit the proposals until May 15th, by all accounts).</p><p><em>(Thanks to Andrew Shuttleworth for pointing out that this year’s AU class proposal process doesn’t involve community voting; the AU team will be collecting community feedback through other means. Apologies for any confusion caused!)</em></p>
