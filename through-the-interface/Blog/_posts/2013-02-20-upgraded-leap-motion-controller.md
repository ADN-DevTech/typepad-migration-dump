<p>It’s been a good week for gadgets. Aside from getting <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2013/02/blinking-lights-with-a-netduino-plus-2.html" target="_blank">a Netduino</a> and some additional accessories through the post, I also received a newer version of the Leap Motion controller. The last one I had was a 0.4 version (at least that’s what was written on the box) and the new one is a 0.6.5.</p>  <p>Here they are, side-by-side. The one on the left is the newer one, of course, although I quite like the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_Circuit" target="_blank">Johnny 5</a> look of the older one, myself.</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2017d412e05a5970c-pi" target="_blank"><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; margin: 20px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="Leap from 0.4 to 0.6.5" border="0" alt="Leap from 0.4 to 0.6.5" src="/assets/image_494924.jpg" width="394" height="264" /></a></p>  <p>I went ahead and installed the latest SDK – which took me from 0.7.1 up to 0.7.3 – and made sure the code <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2013/01/integrating-leap-motion-and-autocad-basic-navigation.html" target="_blank">I’d</a> <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2013/01/integrating-leap-motion-and-autocad-command-interaction.html" target="_blank">posted</a> <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2013/01/integrating-leap-motion-and-autocad-3d-geometry.html" target="_blank">previously</a> continues to work (it does). Before anyone asks me for the older device, I should say it’s already been handed down to a colleague working in a different product team. Sorry about that.</p>  <p>The newer controllers are a bit more sensitive: the size of the capture volume has been increased, so your hand doesn’t need to be quite as high above the device as was previously the case. I also found that I no longer had to set the device on low power mode when working with a virtualised environment.</p>  <p>More enhancements are on the way, too: I’ve been told work is being done to further mitigate concerns – such as those I mentioned <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2013/01/integrating-leap-motion-and-autocad-review.html" target="_blank">in my own posts</a> – about the need to hover for the gesture detection to work properly. It’ll be very interesting to see what the team at Leap Motion is able to come up with – hopefully a device that can be used effectively over longer periods.</p>  <p>AutoCAD is clearly just one of the 3D products in the Autodesk portfolio. Without going into specifics, I can say there are other teams also coming up with prototype integrations. One such integration – for 123D Design – has a demo video posted to YouTube:</p>  <br />  <p><iframe height="264" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/nGpy7_jitIk?rel=0" frameborder="0" width="470" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>  <br />  <p>Echoing something I read in the comments, I also like the way the 123D team managed to get the video exactly 1:23 in length. :-)</p>
