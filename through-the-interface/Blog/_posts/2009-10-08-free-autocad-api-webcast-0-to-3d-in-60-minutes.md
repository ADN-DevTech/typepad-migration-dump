<p>Next week Fenton Webb, from DevTech Americas, will be presenting a free webcast on the 3D capabilities of AutoCAD’s APIs. Here’s Fenton’s synopsis:</p>  <blockquote>   <p><em>“If your product has always been 2D and you are now considering moving to 3D or if you are simply interested in finding out about the different API’s that are available to program AutoCAD in 3D then come join this webcast. We’ll give a brief overview history of 3D in AutoCAD along with some code demonstrations of some API’s in operation. Also, don’t forget that included at the end is a Q and A section allowing you to ask any questions you might have.”</em></p> </blockquote>  <p>The session will be taking place at 8am Pacific/10am Eastern/4pm in the UK/5pm in Central Europe, on October 13, 2009, and will presumably last about an hour (although I can well imagine the Q&amp;A might make it longer). :-)</p>  <p>To register, please go to <a href="http://www.adskconsulting.com/adn/cs/api_course_sched.php">our API training schedule</a> (also accessible via <a href="http://www.autodesk.com/apitraining">http://www.autodesk.com/apitraining</a>). As usual, we will be posting links to the recording of this session on the API training schedule page, in case you’re not able to attend.</p>
