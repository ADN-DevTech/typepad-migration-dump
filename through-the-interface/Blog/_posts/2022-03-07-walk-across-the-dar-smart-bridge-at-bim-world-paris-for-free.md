<p>This is all very exciting. I’ve booked my TGV ticket for Paris to attend a physical, in-person event: <a href="https://bim-w.com/" target="_blank">BIM World Paris</a> is being held on <strong>April 5th &amp; 6th, 2022</strong>, at <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/BCBSRSHEymYVcYSs8" target="_blank">Porte de Versailles</a>.</p><p>Autodesk is sponsoring the event, and the Autodesk Research team will be using the opportunity to show off the work that was done on the <a href="https://fom.autodesk.com/dar-smart-bridge/p/1" target="_blank">2m Dar Smart Bridge</a>, something <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2022/02/building-the-2m-dar-smart-bridge.html" target="_blank">I’ve covered recently in some depth</a>. I’ll be attending along with my friends and colleagues Pete Storey and Fikret Kalay.</p><p>In preparation for the event, I’ve been remoting into the PC running the bridge’s “operating system”, that’s currently at the Dar office in Dubai. We’ve been working to make sure the data can be streamed across directly to Dasher via web sockets: a technique we’ve used for the <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2021/07/data-from-the-mx3d-smart-bridge.html" target="_blank">MX3D smart bridge</a>, both for <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2018/10/the-mx3d-bridge-at-dutch-design-week.html" target="_blank">Dutch Design Week in 2018</a> and more recently for the <a href="https://www.smartbridgeamsterdam.com/" target="_blank">Smart Bridge Amsterdam website</a>.</p><p>Here are some videos of the data coming off the FiSens system, which then gets broadcast across the local network to interested clients.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20282e14847a5200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="287" title="Strain data" style="margin: 30px auto; float: none; display: block;" alt="Strain data" src="/assets/image_910969.jpg"></a></p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20282e14847ab200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="287" title="Sensor detail" style="margin: 30px auto; float: none; display: block;" alt="Sensor detail" src="/assets/image_749583.jpg"></a></p><p><a href="https://dasher360.com" target="_blank">Dasher</a> seems to be picking up the data well. As the bridge is soon to be packed up to be shipped across to Paris, any further tweaks will have to be done during setup on April 4th.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20282e14847b3200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="287" title="Early data" style="margin: 30px auto; float: none; display: block;" alt="Early data" src="/assets/image_113698.jpg"></a></p><p>Anyway, back to BIM World. There are a number of French-language workshops being held at BIM World Paris by my colleagues:</p><p>Marie-Lahya Simon will be talking about <strong>Spacemaker</strong> on <strong>April 5th, at 11am</strong>.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20282e1481e87200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="536" height="330" title="Marie-Lahya Simon on Spacemaker" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Marie-Lahya Simon on Spacemaker" src="/assets/image_385696.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Olivier Bayle will be talking about <strong>Autodesk Tandem</strong> on <strong>April 5th at 3pm</strong>.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20282e1481e8e200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="536" height="330" title="Olivier Bayle on Tandem" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Olivier Bayle on Tandem" src="/assets/image_504430.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Julien Drouet will be talking about <strong>BIM Collaborate Pro</strong> on <strong>April 6th at 11am</strong>.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20278806f7a39200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="536" height="330" title="Julien Drouet on BIM Collaborate Pro" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Julien Drouet on BIM Collaborate Pro" src="/assets/image_584146.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>The Autodesk booth will have a few different demo stations where you’ll be able to learn about topics such as Forge, Spacemaker, Autodesk Construction Solutions, Collaboration, Infrastructure and Innovation.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20278806f6c83200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="237" title="The Autodesk stand" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="The Autodesk stand" src="/assets/image_944802.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>There will also be a demo stage where you can attend short presentations. I’ve somehow been roped into talking about our research into Digital Twins in 15-minute presentation on <strong>Wednesday, April 6th at 10am</strong>. I’ll be presenting in French, which should be good for a few laughs.</p><p>If you’re interested in visiting this year’s BIM World, the good news is that you can do so for free! Well, at least in terms of the entrance – I’m not in a position to help with your travel or accommodation costs, of course. :-)</p><p>Autodesk has a discount code you can use during <a href="https://bim-w.com/inscription/" target="_blank">registration</a> to get free entry to BIM World and the adjacent events <a href="https://jumeaux-numeriques.com/" target="_blank">Rencontres des Jumeaux Numériques</a> and <a href="https://bas-carbone.com/" target="_blank">Solutions Bas-Carbone</a>.</p><blockquote><p><b><strong>B22E164</strong></b></p></blockquote><p>Be sure to drop by the Autodesk stand for a chat. While you’re there you can stand on the 2m Dar Smart Bridge and see how the strain measured by the sensor network gets displayed in realtime inside Dasher. It should be really cool!</p>
