<p>There’s a lot going on with AI at Autodesk, these days: most of our engineering teams have developers who are exploring the potential for AI with respect to product features.</p>
<p>For instance, the AutoCAD team has developed and released a number of features driven by machine learning: AutoCAD 2023’s <a href="https://help.autodesk.com/view/ACD/2023/ENU/?guid=GUID-64CFD65E-ABD0-49A8-9218-D4E2D22BC070" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Markup Assist</a> and <a href="https://help.autodesk.com/view/ACD/2023/ENU/?guid=adsk_api_about_autodesk_my_insights" rel="noopener" target="_blank">My Insights</a> features – the latter with its cool <a href="https://blogs.autodesk.com/autocad/whats-new-in-autocad-2023-my-insights-macro-advisor/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Macro Advisor</a> capability – are all powered by ML. I’m less familiar with ML-powered features in Revit and Fusion 360, but I know they have teams focusing on exploring the benefits ML might bring to their users.</p>
<p>All this to say that there’s a lot going on in AI/ML these days in the company, and not just in direct connection with our products: at Autodesk Research we have our own “AI Lab” that is headed up by <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/research/people/tonya-custis" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Tonya Custis</a>, our Director of AI Research. A few weeks ago, Tonya posted <a href="https://adsknews.autodesk.com/views/ai-lab-cvpr-2022" rel="noopener" target="_blank">an article about some of the projects her team have contributed to</a> that had papers accepted at <a href="https://cvpr2022.thecvf.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">this year’s Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition conference (CVPR 2022)</a>.</p>

<p>If you’re interested in AI – and what Autodesk is doing with it – then I suggest checking the post out.</p>
<p>The field of AI is evolving rapidly, even in the context of 3D geometry – with recent surprising advances in <a href="https://3d-diffusion.github.io/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">diffusion models</a> and <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/a-very-basic-overview-of-neural-radiance-fields-nerf-db4a0d4c391b" rel="noopener" target="_blank">neural radiance fields</a> – so I think it’s very important that this cutting-edge research continues.</p>
