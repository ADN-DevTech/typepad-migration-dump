<p>My friend Dieter Vermeulen will be presenting a free, 1-hour webinar at 11am GMT on December 6, 2018, about how Computational Design can improve automation and optimization in the AEC industry. Here’s a photo of Dieter having a turn as DJ at the recent DynaNoche at AU Las Vegas.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad3c11112200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="375" height="500" title="Dieter on the decks" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Dieter on the decks" src="/assets/image_838651.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>While the webinar’s title mentions computational design, Dieter tells me he’ll also be talking about the generative design tool Autodesk released into public Beta last week.</p><p>Here’s the invitation to attend the session:<br>
</p><blockquote><p>Join us for this webinar brought to you by Building Magazine &amp; Autodesk.</p><p><br><strong>
Improve Automation in AEC with Computational Design</strong></p><p>Thursday, December 6, 2018 at 11:00 GMT (London),&nbsp; 1 hour</p><p><em>Please register:</em>&nbsp; <a href="https://www.workcast.com/register?cpak=5696270144363062">https://www.workcast.com/register?cpak=5696270144363062</a></p><p><br>
In the Architecture Engineering Construction (AEC) industry, we are challenged to consider many design options, to find the fittest solution in the shortest time, and to be leaders in economic and sustainable designs.</p><p><br></p><p>During this session you will learn about:</p><ul><li>How computational design techniques can help automate and improve this process in design and fabrication workflows for buildings.</li><li>Several workflows in architecture and engineering that you can use to optimize your designs with the Autodesk AEC Collection and Dynamo.</li><li>All kinds of techniques and computational design approaches to generate, evaluate, evolve, and cycle through design processes.</li><li>How to perform your own design automation for repetitive tasks.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;<br><em>
Who should attend:</em> Anyone interested in improving and streamlining architecture or engineering designer workflows<br>&nbsp; <br><em>
Speakers:</em> Dieter Vermeulen, Autodesk</p></blockquote><p>Knowing the quality of Dieter’s material, I expect this session to be well worth attending. I’ll certainly be calling in!</p>
