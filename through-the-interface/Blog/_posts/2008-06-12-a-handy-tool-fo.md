<p>Back in <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2006/07/migrating_code_.html">this previous post</a> I mentioned a tool known as Teefy to help migrate C++ code to use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode">Unicode</a> for strings instead of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-byte_character_set">MBCS</a>.</p>

<p>This tool was previously only made available to ADN members, but we now have a version that is available for everyone. And <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/files/visual_teefy_1.23%20MulitLang%20EULA.zip">here it is</a>.</p>
