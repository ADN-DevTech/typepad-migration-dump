<p>In <a href="https://youtu.be/nR8M52ooEc0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">this week’s episode</a> we play four classic Commodore 64 games. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Tetris</a> needs no introduction, of course, while we then went on to play a horizontal shooter called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_(video_game)" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Delta</a> followed by what may have been the “goriest game of the 80s”: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_Wish_3#Video_game" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Deathwish III</a>. We wrapped up with a quick play of a racing game called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buggy_Boy" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Buggy Boy</a>.</p>

<p>All in all it was a fun episode, once again. That said, I was really a bit shocked at the amount of blood shown in Deathwish III. Here’s <a href="http://www.zzap64.co.uk/cgi-bin/displaypage.pl?issue=029&amp;page=093&amp;thumbstart=0&amp;magazine=zzap" rel="noopener" target="_blank">its Zzap!64 review</a> from September 1987:</p>

<p>Today is my last day in Amsterdam – I recorded this last week, as I knew I wouldn’t be home in time. I’ll be sure to deliver a fresh episode of Floppy Friday next week, as usual.</p>
