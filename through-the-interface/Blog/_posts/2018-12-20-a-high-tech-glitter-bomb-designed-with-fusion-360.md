<p>There’s <a href="https://youtu.be/xoxhDk-hwuo" target="_blank">a video that’s currently going viral on YouTube</a> – with 35 million views and at #4 on the trending list – wherein <a href="https://twitter.com/markrober" target="_blank">a former NASA engineer turned professional YouTuber</a> (sigh) shows how he designed and deployed a super-cool glitter bomb to counter local parcel thieves. It was <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-46604625" target="_blank">picked up a few days ago by the BBC</a>, back when it had a mere 6 million views.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad3828fc2200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="284" title="Testing the glitter bomb" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Testing the glitter bomb" src="/assets/image_747247.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>The video is genuinely fascinating, especially towards the end where it shows footage captured by the integrated mobile phones of various thieves opening it up and triggering explosions of glitter followed by releases of high-potency fart spray (I kid you not).</p><p align="center"><br></p><p align="center"><iframe width="500" height="283" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/xoxhDk-hwuo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"></iframe></p><p><br></p><p>Anyway, what’s especially cool is that the glitter bomb was designed using an Autodesk product. Here’s the relevant section of the video showing the model inside Fusion 360:</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad3a88f4a200d-pi"><img width="500" height="281" title="Glitter bomb design in Fusion 360" style="margin: 30px auto; float: none; display: block;" alt="Glitter bomb design in Fusion 360" src="/assets/image_356124.jpg"></a></p><p>I’m always pleased to see our software used in ways that genuinely help humanity. (Although I’m definitely bemused/depressed that theft of packages from people’s front doors is common enough to provoke the creation of such elaborate countermeasures. I doubt very much we’d see anything but the odd isolated incident in Switzerland.)</p>
