<p>This week I'm spending time in Amsterdam and London.</p>
<p>On Sunday I headed across to Geneva airport and checked into a hotel that’s a gentle 10-minute walk from the terminal.<a href="/assets/image_623258.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Airport hotel" src="/assets/image_623258.jpg" alt="Airport hotel." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>It was the first time I’d stayed there, and I admit I was pleasantly surprised. The atrium was nice and I even had a cheeky sauna before sleeping.</p>

<p>The alarm going off soon after 5am was a bit of a shock, but I felt rested enough. The walk across to the terminal was pleasant, considering the early hour. There weren't yet cars on the roads.<a href="/assets/image_205716.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Walking to the terminal" src="/assets/image_205716.jpg" alt="Walking to the terminal." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Security was really quick, so I got to the gate in good time.</p>

<p>The flight from Geneva to Schipol is around 65 minutes. Mine was due to leave at 7:15am but had a slight delay. We still arrived basically on time just before 9am.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_741738.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Arriving at Schipol" src="/assets/image_741738.jpg" alt="Arriving at Schipol." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Arriving was smooth, and at 9:23am I was on the train to the Central Station.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_228915.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="The train to Central Station" src="/assets/image_228915.jpg" alt="The train to Central Station." width="375" height="500" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>My Airbnb is right across from the conference venue. It’s always a bit of a lottery when you stay in Amsterdam… the flat was nice and spacious, but it’s a) a bit noisy and b) allowed smoking. So the place needed serious airing when I got there.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_883477.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="The Airbnb" src="/assets/image_883477.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>And the stairs! You can’t see the gradient from this picture, but I’m always stunned at how steep the staircase are in these old Dutch buildings.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_193446.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="The stairs" src="/assets/image_193446.jpg" alt="" width="375" height="500" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>I’ve gone past the Beurs van Berlaga many times in the past, but this was my first time inside.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_335199.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Beurs van Berlage" src="/assets/image_335199.jpg" alt="Beurs van Berlage." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>The Dynamo Hackathon preceding DevCon was held in Meet Berlage, a separated but connected space.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_348118.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Meet Berlage" src="/assets/image_348118.jpg" alt="Meet Berlage." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>I wasn’t there long before the easy Dutch snacks came out. Oh dear.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_146773.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Tasty Dutch snacks" src="/assets/image_146773.jpg" alt="Tasty Dutch snacks." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>In between helping a few teams with their problems - some relating to VASA and others to AutoCAD (yes, my AutoCAD knowledge is beyond rusty at this point but hey) - I decided to head over to the former location of the MX3D bridge. For old times’ sake.</p>
<p>In Google Maps the MX3D bridge is still there. It was just 500m from the event venue, so a quick walk.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_743920.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="It's still there virtually" src="/assets/image_743920.jpg" alt="It's still there virtually." width="375" height="500" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>The new Stoofbrug is nothing like the previous one, of course.At least the old one had corner swirls for people to through their rubbish into.<a href="/assets/image_581403.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="The new Stoofbrug" src="/assets/image_581403.jpg" alt="The new Stoofbrug." width="375" height="500" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>It's functional enough, but I was surprised to see steps at both ends: I'd understood that one of the complaints about the MX3D bridge was that it had steps on one side. Hmm.<a href="/assets/image_833774.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Meh" src="/assets/image_833774.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Adam Nagy was kind enough to keep me company on the walk. It's always nice seeing him.<a href="/assets/image_527926.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Hanging with Adam" src="/assets/image_527926.jpg" alt="Hanging with Adam." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Back at the Hackathon, I was mainly helping a team focused on Walkable Cities - something that’s very aligned with my own research interests (which is also why they opted to explore using VASA).</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_661017.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Hacking VASA" src="/assets/image_661017.jpg" alt="Hacking VASA." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>There were 10 teams entered into the Hackathon. The share-out was great - a single-day Hackathon is really tough, but it’s always impressive to see what can be achieved.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_26915.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Assembling for the share-out" src="/assets/image_26915.jpg" alt="Assembling for the share-out." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Achintya Bhat, a PM on the Dynamop team, did a great job of hosting.<a href="/assets/image_824467.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="MC Achintya" src="/assets/image_824467.jpg" alt="MC Achintya." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>After the awards ceremony I had a few beers and a philosophical chat at the bar with Håvard Vasshaug. He's the only Håvard I know who doesn’t work on the Forma team. (We have several.)<a href="/assets/image_763848.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Håvard and Kean" src="/assets/image_763848.jpg" alt="Håvard and Kean." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>We were joined by Subhransu and Sandip from CCTech.<br /><a href="/assets/image_344402.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Subhransu, Sandip and Kean" src="/assets/image_344402.jpg" alt="Subhransu, Sandip and Kean." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a>After the Dynamo reception I headed back across to the Wagamama at Central Station for dinner with (mostly) members of the Impact team.<a href="/assets/image_600528.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Across to Wagamama" src="/assets/image_600528.jpg" alt="Across to Wagamama." width="375" height="500" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>After a very nice meal together we headed back towards our respective accommodations.<a href="/assets/image_171988.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="A fun group" src="/assets/image_171988.jpg" alt="A fun group." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>It was nearly 10pm but still light out.<a href="/assets/image_420119.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Back to the Airbnb" src="/assets/image_420119.jpg" alt="Back to the Airbnb." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>That was it for my first day at this year’s DevCon. On Day 1 I’ll be presenting a session on using WebAssembly with APS (specifically Forma). There’ll be more on the DevCon in the coming posts!</p>
