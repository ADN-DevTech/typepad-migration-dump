<p>So, here we are on Wednesday, day two of AU proper (although my team was busy with ADN-only sessions on Sunday and Monday). Yesterday was really fun: I was part of the “Meet the AutoCAD API Experts” panel (along with Stephen Preston, Albert Szilvasy, Mike Dickason, Bill Adkison, Davis Augustine and Fenton Webb), which is always a good session (and a privilege to spend some time alongside some of the brightest minds in CAD programming).</p>  <p>I then had the honour of co-speaking a session on AutoCAD scripting with dave espinosa-aguilar, probably the all-time highest-rated AU speaker. It was really something to see dave in action: he has an energy level that I could probably only achieve by setting myself on fire. dave spent the first hour talking about core scripting issues, which I then attempted to follow by talking about and demoing ScriptPro 2.0.&#160; I just hope my involvement didn’t impact the session rating too badly.</p>  <p>There were a number of internal meetings, throughout the day, and I have more going on today, too, along with another panel (“AutoCAD Programming Gurus Go Head to Head”) and the session I’ve probably been looking forward to most, “<a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2011/11/au-2011-handout-integrating-microsoft-kinect-with-autocad.html" target="_blank">Integrating Microsoft Kinect with AutoCAD</a>”. Given <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2011/11/coming-soon-kinect-for-your-pc.html" target="_blank">the recent announcement of Kinect for PC</a>, the timing of this class has turned out to be extremely relevant. Beyond the session itself, I’m just impatient to see what developers will do with this technology over the coming year or two.</p>  <p>Thanks to all who have taken the time to come up to me and introduce themselves, and also to give feedback on this blog. Although I write this mainly for my own pleasure, it certainly feels good to hear it’s helping people.</p>  <p>And in case anyone at AU happens to be reading this, please drop by the Exhibit Hall this evening to say “Hi”: I’ll be staffing the Global Services booth from 6:30pm to 9:30pm, and I’d appreciate the company. :-)</p>
