<p>It’s that time of year again (it’s actually a little later than when we published these surveys <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2008/04/api-wishlist-su.html">last year</a>, but still). The following “Summer 2009” API wishlist surveys are now ready:</p>  <p><a href="http://www.zoomerang.com/Survey/?p=WEB229EA3ZYRUS">AutoCAD®</a>     <br /><a href="http://www.zoomerang.com/Survey/?p=WEB229EPE28VYM">AutoCAD® Civil 3D®</a>     <br /><a href="http://www.zoomerang.com/Survey/?p=WEB229BU6PH7J9">Revit®</a>     <br /><a href="http://www.zoomerang.com/Survey/?p=WEB229EPCV8VA2">Autodesk® Inventor®</a></p>  <p>Please do take the time to fill out the surveys for the products you customize or develop applications for. Our Engineering teams use the feedback you provide to prioritise our API development efforts: this is a great chance for you to have a direct impact on the direction we take in exposing APIs from our products. And if you (optionally) provide your email address in the survey, I’ll send you a copy of the results once they’ve been compiled.</p>  <p>The surveys will remain open until <strong>July 31st, 2009</strong>. Thanks in advance for your feedback!</p>
