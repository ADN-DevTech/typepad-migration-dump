<p>Last week was very quiet for me: starting with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memorial_day" target="_blank">Memorial Day</a> in the US meant a gentle start for me in Europe, too, and the week ended on Wednesday evening as we then had our own long weekend for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feast_of_the_Ascension" target="_blank">Ascension</a>, here in Switzerland. It was nice to have some time off just before a work trip: I’m getting up before dawn tomorrow to head across to Toronto for Autodesk’s annual internal Technical Summit (generally a really interesting and useful event – I’m very much looking forward to it).</p>  <p>Over the last few years – as those of you who follow <a href="http://twitter.com/keanw" target="_blank">me on Twitter</a> may know – I’ve been heading up on a regular basis to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernese_Oberland" target="_blank">Bernese Oberland</a> (mostly on weekends) with my family. It’s a gentle 1.5 hour drive from our home, making it very accessible.</p>  <p>My final professional activity of last week was our regular team meeting, which I took from the road (my wife was driving). I mentioned I was heading up to the mountains, which my boss said always makes him think of “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sound_of_Music_(film)" target="_blank">The Sound of Music</a>”. In fairness he’s not actually far from the mark. Although I fear that if my family and I started singing in chorus we’d only raise eyebrows and scatter the local wildlife. :-)</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201a73dd065f8970d-pi" target="_blank"><img title="The hills are alive with pollen, anyway" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 20px auto; border-left: 0px; display: block; padding-right: 0px" border="0" alt="The hills are alive with pollen, anyway" src="/assets/image_726151.jpg" width="270" height="353" /></a></p>  <p>I’d planned on catching up on some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course" target="_blank">MOOC</a>-related work over the long weekend, but the weather was so nice that it ended up having to wait until our return on Sunday.</p>  <p>As I’ve mentioned before, I’ve been plugging away on a few different MOOCs in my spare time. Here’s what I’ve worked on, so far:</p>  <ul>   <li><a href="https://class.coursera.org/matrix-001" target="_blank">Coding the Matrix: Linear Algebra through Computer Science Applications</a> from Brown via Coursera (<a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2013/08/coursera-the-future-of-education.html" target="_blank">my</a> <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2013/08/applications-for-linear-algebra-straightening-out-perspective.html" target="_blank">posts</a> on it)</li>    <li><a href="https://courses.edx.org/courses/BerkeleyX/CS-184.1x/2013_October" target="_blank">Foundations of Computer Graphics</a> from BerkeleyX via edX (<a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2013/10/sharpening-the-saw.html" target="_blank">my</a> <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2013/11/writing-a-ray-tracer.html" target="_blank">posts</a> <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2013/11/using-autocad-to-debug-external-ray-tracing-routines.html" target="_blank">on it</a>)</li>    <li><a href="https://courses.edx.org/courses/ETHx/AMRx/1T2014" target="_blank">Autonomous Mobile Robots</a> from ETHx via edX (<a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2014/02/autonomous-mobile-robots.html" target="_blank">my post</a> on it)</li>    <li><a href="https://courses.edx.org/courses/BerkeleyX/EECS149.1x/2T2014" target="_blank">Cyber-Physical Systems</a> from BerkeleyX via edX</li> </ul>  <p>I haven’t talked about the last one, as yet. It’s one I’ve taken to shore up my knowledge of embedded systems: writing software that integrates with hardware is a very different skill, so this is helping exercise that part of my brain. The latest Lab exercise involved programming a virtual robot (an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRobot_Create" target="_blank">iRobot Create</a>, a programmable sibling of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roomba" target="_blank">Roomba</a>) to climb hills, determining the incline via its onboard accelerometer and avoiding obstacles based on various other sensor readings.</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201a3fd15a59f970b-pi" target="_blank"><img title="Driving a virtual robot up hills" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 20px auto; border-left: 0px; display: block; padding-right: 0px" border="0" alt="Driving a virtual robot up hills" src="/assets/image_769142.jpg" width="454" height="257" /></a></p>  <p>Fun stuff, but also very valuable for my research on using <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2013/11/leap-motion-kinect-fusion-sensortag.html" target="_blank">SensorTag accelerometer</a> <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2013/11/driving-autocad-via-the-accelerometer-in-a-sensortag.html" target="_blank">data to drive AutoCAD</a>, something <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/au/" target="_blank">I’ve proposed as an AU 2014 class</a>.</p>  <p>I’m basically done with these robotics-related classes, at this stage, which is a bit of a relief. I’d originally been concerned about the theoretical focus of “Autonomous Mobile Robots” but I ended up managing to keep up with the assignments fairly well. I’ve also completed most of the “Cyber-Physical Systems” assignments (enough to scrape a “pass”, anyway), so that will soon be finished, too.</p>  <p>There’s a really interesting class being delivered by TUMx (the University of Munich) called <a href="https://courses.edx.org/courses/ETHx/AMRx/1T2014/info" target="_blank">Autonomous Navigation for Flying Robots</a>. This one actually costs money to get a certificate ($50), so I’ve thus far only signed up to audit the class (although that has as much to do with timing as the cost). The materials look really interesting, though, so I’ve downloaded 4 weeks worth of lecture that I’ll try to dig into on my trip across to Toronto.</p>  <p>As you can probably see, I’m a huge fan of MOOCs, although I admit it can be hard to find the time to work through them. I recommend taking a look at some of the online classes that are available: you can very often get access to top quality material by just auditing classes, assuming you don’t feel you have the time to keep up with the homework assignments.</p>
