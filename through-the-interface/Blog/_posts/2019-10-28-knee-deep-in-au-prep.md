<p>Things have been quiet on this blog, since my return from <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2019/10/scotland.html" target="_blank">Scotland</a>. Mainly because I’ve been heads-down dealing with preparation for <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/autodesk-university/" target="_blank">Autodesk University 2019</a>, which I’d love to say was on the horizon, whereas it’s – more accurately – coming at top speed around a nearby streetcorner. In less than 3 weeks many us us will be flying to Las Vegas for the latest installment of my favourite annual conference.</p><p>Today was the deadline for AU speakers to submit class handouts: I managed to submit something for both my classes, so I can now switch focus to the various presentations I need to prepare for them. While working on the presentation for <a href="https://autodeskuniversity.smarteventscloud.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=322469" target="_blank">my class on Project Rediscover</a>, I created this fun little GIF, which shows in broad terms the way the MaRS geometry system (and some of its goals) work.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4e4b37f200b-pi"><img width="500" height="405" title="MaRS steps" style="margin: 30px auto; float: none; display: block;" alt="MaRS steps" src="/assets/image_529737.jpg"></a></p><p>As mentioned in <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2019/09/ramping-up-for-autodesk-university-2019.html" target="_blank">a recent post</a>, this year I have 3 sessions (2 classic 60-minute lectures – the other being <a href="https://autodeskuniversity.smarteventscloud.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=322461" target="_blank">this one</a> relating to our work on <a href="http://dasher360.com/" target="_blank">Dasher 360</a> – plus a 15-minute Theater Talk) to prepare. In addition, though, I’ve been asked to help prepare some additional demos for the event. (I’ll share more about these, in due course.)</p><p>For one of these demos – which has also been a longstanding need when working with multi-discipline, as-built BIM – I went ahead and added the ability to define and manage visibility of custom layers in Dasher 360 (beyond what’s provided by default in the Forge viewer). Here’s a quick example showing the "Architectural” layer turned on, with both “Electrical” and “Mechanical” set to X-Ray mode (i.e. you can see them through the solid architectural geometry).</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4e4b384200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="312" title="X-Ray vision in Dasher 360" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="X-Ray vision in Dasher 360" src="/assets/image_642220.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>I still have quite a bit to get done before flying out, but at this stage I can see the light at the end the tunnel. In fact – if the stars align and I don’t get bogged down with urgent, last-minute requests – I can actually imagine being in a situation where I even get some breathing space before the event. Hopefully I haven’t jinxed it by even thinking that way.</p><p>First things first I need to wrap up the various slide-decks and keep on top of the demo work… hopefully I’ll have something to share in another progress report before the end of the week.</p>
