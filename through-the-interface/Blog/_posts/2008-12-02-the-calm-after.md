<p>After all, I arrived safely in Las Vegas, only a few hours late - people travelling in any later were apparently not all so lucky - so I managed to attend our ADN Developer Day here, today. In the queue for the evening's party I managed to take a quick video of some members of the ADN team (most being current, one - Albert - being previous).</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/VJvCbfwz-zc&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1" width="425" height="344" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always"></embed> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>I've been asked to do more of these posts during the conference proper, so watch this space!</p> <p>By the way - in case the end of the video cuts short, the original says "more to follow". :-)</p>
