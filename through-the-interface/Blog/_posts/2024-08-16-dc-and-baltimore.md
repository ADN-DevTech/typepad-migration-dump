<p>I haven’t been the the US purely for personal reasons for quite some time. The last time was probably on <a href="https://keanw.com/round-the-world" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our round-the-world trip</a>, and interestingly our first stop was in Washington DC.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_136087.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Boarding in Zurich." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_136087.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Boarding in Zurich" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>I’ve just flown across to Dulles, to help my sone get settled into his exchange university. I always love seeing the crazy elevator bus transport system that I haven’t yet seen anywhere else in the world.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_768678.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="A strange bus." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_768678.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="A strange bus" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>It’s like you’re in some strange parallel universe where this kind of futuristic system became widespread, back in the day.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_832922.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Elevated and now docking." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_832922.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Elevated and now docking" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>What I like less about Dulles is the immigration queue. We were the last of a group of flights, it seems, and had the joy of gradually seeing the queue reduce over 90 minutes until a shift change at 6pm meant there were even fewer agents to help. Death by a thousand immigration stamps.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_723453.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="A full immigration hall." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_723453.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="A full immigration hall" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>When we eventually got through, we headed into DC on the Metro.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_830670.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Welcome to Dulles." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_830670.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Welcome to Dulles" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>We started on the Silver line, which took about 50 minutes into DC.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_810324.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="On the Metro at last." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_810324.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="On the Metro at last" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>And we changed at the beautiful Metro Center to take the Red line to Union Station.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_832293.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Changing at the Matro Center." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_832293.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Changing at the Matro Center" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>We walked from there back to our hotel - which I’d chosen as it was a short walk to Union Station for our train to Baltimore the following day.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_293732.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Walking to the hotel." border="0" height="500" src="/assets/image_293732.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Walking to the hotel" width="375" /></a></p>
<p>It was a Yotel, which felt a lot like a Citizen M.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_192749.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Welcome to DC." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_192749.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Welcome to DC" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>After checking in we headed back out to an Irish Pub we’d passed on the way.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_224405.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="At The Dubliners for dinner." border="0" height="500" src="/assets/image_224405.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="At The Dubliners for dinner" width="375" /></a></p>
<p>My son has gone back to not being allowed to drink - he’s just 20 - but frankly this isn’t a concern for him at all. He finds it quite funny.</p>
<p>I&#39;m doing what I can to compensate, though.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_135948.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" height="500" src="/assets/image_135948.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Guinness" width="375" /></a></p>
<p>Walking back to the hotel we realized how close our hotel was from the Capitol.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_643941.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="The Capitol up the road from the Yotel." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_643941.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="The Capitol up the road from the Yotel" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>I’ve always said that I love being jet-lagged as it lets you see things in the place you’re visiting that you wouldn’t otherwise. If you’re not encumbered by work or social considerations - like being awake and functional at a certain time - it’s like having a strange, privileged window into a life you wouldn’t see.</p>
<p>So after being awake at 4am and not being able to get back to sleep, at 6am I headed on out to the Capitol to experience it at dawn.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_216934.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Capitol at dawn." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_216934.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Capitol at dawn" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>It was really strange being in the spot of the hyper-televised January 6th attack, although without anyone else around.</p>
<p>I wandered around to the other side, as I saw it was had the morning light hitting it.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_587621.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="From an angle." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_587621.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="From an angle" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Heading around the corner I saw something very strange. There seemed to be a full state funeral taking place! Had I missed something in the news?</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_547406.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Something strange." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_547406.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Something strange" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>I ended up asking a police officer about the situation. She kindly explained that it was just a drill: every so often they go through the full motions of a full state funeral, so that they’re ready when one happens. I was happy to hear the coffin was empty (or full of a representative amount of sand, perhaps?).&#0160;</p>
<p>Once we were up and about we headed to Union Station to take our train to Baltimore. I’d forgotten how painful train travel is in the US. You have to queue just to be allowed onto the platform to take the train. The rest of the world considers this a solved problem, honestly.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_588790.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="The Amtrak to Baltimore." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_588790.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="The Amtrak to Baltimore" width="500" /></a>On arriving in Baltimore’s Penn Station we hopped on the Silver line up Charles Street to get to the Charles and East 33rd Street stop. My son will be studying at Johns Hopkins University for the coming academic year, on an exchange from his home university of EPFL.</p>
<p>We got settled into his “right next to campus” accommodation, which seems very comfortable.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_382072.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Nice digs for a student." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_382072.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Nice digs for a student" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>We’d been warned that we would need to bring - or buy - our own bedding, so I’d gone online and had some shipped so he wouldn’t be on a bare mattress for the first day or so. As I couldn’t send it to his hall of residence before he was checked in, I had it send to a nearby UPS Access Point, which was a very interesting walk away.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_615405.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Bedding in a box." border="0" height="500" src="/assets/image_615405.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Bedding in a box" width="375" /></a></p>
<p>Once this had been taken care of we could visit the campus.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_201948.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="The Homewood campus sign." border="0" height="500" src="/assets/image_201948.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="The Homewood campus sign" width="375" /></a></p>
<p>It’s really a lovely campus.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_766418.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="On the campus itself." border="0" height="500" src="/assets/image_766418.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="On the campus itself" width="375" /></a></p>
<p>With lots of old trees.<a href="/assets/image_873813.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="A beautiful campus." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_873813.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="A beautiful campus" width="500" /></a>I think he’ll have an amazing experience here.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_676389.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="The JHU sign." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_676389.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="The JHU sign" width="500" /></a>We popped into the Barnes and Noble, which seems to gradually transforming itself from being a bookshop to selling JHU merchandise. How about that for a statement on the shift in our society?</p>
<p>In case you’re wondering, no, I didn’t buy this T-shirt.<br /><a href="/assets/image_897672.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Merch gone mad." border="0" height="500" src="/assets/image_897672.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Merch gone mad" width="375" /></a>I have managed to organize one work-related meeting, while I’m here, with someone from the <a href="https://www.artsandmindlab.org">International Arts + Mind Lab</a> at JHU. Other than that the coming days will mostly be about picking up the extras that are always needed when you move into student accommodation. Fun times!</p>
