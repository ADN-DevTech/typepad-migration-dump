<p>The least interesting piece of this recording is when I’m speaking, so really do please feel free to stop watching beforehand. It’s quite near the end, so you have plenty to enjoy until then.</p>

<p>We’re very excited about the future of this collaboration with UCL: we have <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2025/01/work-on-a-phd-project-with-autodesk-research-and-the-bartlett-school-of-architecture-at-ucl.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">co-funded a PhD project</a> for someone to work on analyzing the data collected at last September’s experiment, and we’re genuinely excited about the potential for this kind of data exploration to lead to significant insights that will benefit our customers in their design workflows.</p>
