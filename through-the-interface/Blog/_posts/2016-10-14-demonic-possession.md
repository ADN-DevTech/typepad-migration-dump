<p>Our <a href="http://www.silverdraft.com/demon" target="_blank">Silverdraft Demons</a> arrived from L.A. yesterday – they’ll form the core of the <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2016/09/vristmas-is-coming.html" target="_blank">VR installation in the Autodesk Neuchatel office</a>.</p> <p>Today I had the chance to swing by the office to check them out: they were in our IT area being installed and bound to the network. I do like the idea of binding demons to a corporate network: hopefully they’ll stay within our control, this time.</p> <p>The Silverdraft people included some fun <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promotional_merchandise" target="_blank">schwag</a> in the shipment. Here I am sporting a Demon beanie and a couple of stress balls. I’m definitely more excited than stressed, for now, but I dare say they’ll come in handy once I try to get everything working properly.</p> <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b7c89fe0fa970b-pi" target="_blank"><img title="Demon schwag" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 30px auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="Demon schwag" src="/assets/image_285250.jpg" width="275" height="281"></a></p> <p><a href="http://www.silverdraft.com/products/demon-vr/" target="_blank">These machines</a> are amazing… </p> <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201bb09430ae0970d-pi" target="_blank"><img title="The Demons" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 30px auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="The Demons" src="/assets/image_493396.jpg" width="416" height="281"></a></p> <p>I have a couple of HTC Vives waiting to be mated with them once the second system has been fully prepped. Hopefully I’ll find the time to make a start on it next week!</p>
