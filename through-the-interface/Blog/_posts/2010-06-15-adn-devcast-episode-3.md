<p>Once again, members of the DevTech Americas team have put together an entertaining and informative DevCast session on AutoCAD’s APIs. This time, Gopinath Taget joins Stephen Preston and Fenton Webb to present a number of interesting topics: boundary tracing, associative surfaces, 3D laser scanning and point cloud filtering.</p>
<p>I’ll be covering boundary tracing via this blog in the coming weeks, just as I expect to be doing more with point clouds (coincidentally a laser scanner from <a href="http://www.faro.com" target="_blank">FARO</a> – similar to the one Fenton and Gonzalo use in this DevCast – should be arriving for me today, so watch this space :-).</p>
