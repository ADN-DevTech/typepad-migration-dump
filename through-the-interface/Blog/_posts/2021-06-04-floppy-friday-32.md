<p>That’s it – we’re halfway there! I was hoping to make a bigger splash with my 2^5th episode, but between my first vaccine jab and my first foray into team sports in 8 months (yes, perhaps not the wisest combo, but there you go), I had neither the time nor the energy to make something fancy. I was actually hoping that some good friends would come through with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_SX-64" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Commodore SX-64</a> they have in their attic, but it turned out to be harder to uncover than expected. Hopefully still one for a future episode.</p>
<p>We covered a few games in this episode and there were several more that failed to load that I edited out: I don’t want to be unnecessarily cruel to my handful of faithful viewers. Over the coming weeks I probably need to clean my drive heads, as there are a few loading issues with certain disks.</p>
<p>The first game was actually a classic (little did I know at the time) called <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/killer-watt" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Killer Watt</a>, where you’re meant to fly around breaking lightbulbs. The latter two were both sequels: I liked the visuals on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Games_II" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Summer Games II</a> a lot – even if I was awful at the equestrian event and so missed out on kayaking – and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gremlins_2:_The_New_Batch_(video_game)" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Gremlins 2</a> was a blast from the past, having been mildly terrified by the two movies as a child.</p>
