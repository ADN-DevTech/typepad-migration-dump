<p>This week we rolled out a significant update to <a href="http://dasher360.com" target="_blank">Dasher 360</a>. Those of you who follow this blog regularly will already have seen the implementation details for a number of the features in this release, from point cloud-based sensor dots to “Kiosk Mode”. I’ve linked to those posts wherever possible.</p> <p>We’ll take a look at the changes in terms of Dasher 360’s Forge viewer extensions, which mostly correspond to items in the Dasher 360 toolbar to the left of the page:</p> <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201bb098705ab970d-pi" target="_blank"><img title="Dasher 360's extensions" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 30px auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="Dasher 360's extensions" src="/assets/image_964761.jpg" width="120" height="285"></a></p> <p>Here are the major changes since <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2016/12/dasher-360-give-it-a-try.html" target="_blank">the December release</a>. If you want to skip the details, just open <a href="http://dasher360.com" target="_blank">Dasher 360</a> and click “Kiosk Mode” to be taken through many of its features.

I’ll also keep you posted as further features get deployed.</p>
