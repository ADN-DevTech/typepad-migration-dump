<p>While in our San Francisco office, the week before last, I bumped into Brian Mathews and team as they were making their final preparations for <a href="http://conferences.ted.com/TED2011/program/" target="_blank">the TED 2011 conference</a>. I don’t know how many of you know about <a href="http://www.ted.com" target="_blank">TED</a>: it&#39;s an amazing conference - and information resource - that I&#39;m proud to say that <a href="http://www.ted.com/pages/182" target="_blank">Autodesk sponsors</a>. It’s a dream of mine to attend this event in person (maybe one day I’ll get the chance) but at least the sessions are posted online for everyone to enjoy.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://labs.autodesk.com/" target="_blank">Autodesk Labs</a> team has put together some really fun technology – as <a href="http://labs.blogs.com/its_alive_in_the_lab/2011/02/project-photofly-at-ted.html" target="_blank">described</a> in <a href="http://labs.blogs.com/its_alive_in_the_lab/2011/03/project-photofly-the-red-box.html" target="_blank">some detail</a> by Scott Sheppard on his blog – that makes it even easier to capture 3D models using photography.</p>
<p>I’ve talked at great length about <a href="http://photosynth.net/" target="_blank">Microsoft Photosynth</a> and <a href="http://labs.autodesk.com/utilities/photo_scene_editor/" target="_blank">Autodesk Photo Scene Editor</a>, in the past, both of which take sets of images and create 3D models of some kind (whether point clouds or – in the case of the next version of Photo Scene Editor – <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2010/12/back-from-au-2010.html" target="_blank">textured meshes</a>), and both work very well with static scenes. The problems start when you want to capture something more dynamic/transient in nature, as it’s hard to move the camera quickly enough – even when shooting video and extracting stills – to get accurate feature recognition across images.</p>
<p>The Labs team have put together something really neat: an array of cameras attached to a rig and connected to a device that coordinates their actions – essentially taking a picture from each at exactly the same time. It’s a bit like a version of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullet_time">bullet time</a> that handles the specific case of the photos being taken simultaneously.</p>
<p>The resultant images get sent to the <a href="http://labs.autodesk.com/technologies/photofly/" target="_blank">Photofly</a> servers to generate a texture 3D mesh, useable in (and exportable from) an as-yet-unreleased version of Photo Scene Editor, codenamed “Caipi”.</p>
<p>I haven’t yet heard whether the TED luminaries found the technology of interest, although I’m sure they will have – this stuff is really cool.</p>
