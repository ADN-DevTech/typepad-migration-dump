<p>On Saturday I headed over to Las Vegas for Autodesk University 2019. The journey started with the train to Geneva.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4ed22cd200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="452" height="339" title="View from the train" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="View from the train" src="/assets/image_148281.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>From there it was a short flight to London, which amazingly arrived 30 minutes ahead of schedule.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4ed22d4200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="452" height="339" title="Loop the loop over Bromley" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Loop the loop over Bromley" src="/assets/image_195840.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>I had a 3-hour connection at Heathrow, so my old friend Simon picked me up from T5 and we had a nice pub lunch at The Ostrich Inn in Colnbrook before he dropped me at T3. And people say that Heathrow airport transfers aren’t enjoyable!</p><p>It was a really strange onward flight to Las Vegas. I’m so used to this flight being full of Autodeskers and AU attendees… I’m sure there were AUers on the flight but I didn’t recognise anyone. It was a different feeling, but I have to admit I didn’t mind too much. There would be plenty of time for interaction during the week.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4c864e8200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="452" height="339" title="BA275 to Las Vegas" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="BA275 to Las Vegas" src="/assets/image_671520.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Arriving in Vegas I took an Uber from the airport. It was actually really interesting to do so – I usually just jump in a taxi – if only because it took a more optimal path to the Palazzo, that came up on the hotel via the Sands Expo.</p><p><img width="452" height="339" title="Taxi to The Palazzo" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Taxi to The Palazzo" src="/assets/image_402882.jpg" border="0"><p>Checking in I headed up to my room, which – as ever in these hotels – was three times as big as I needed with three TVs more than I watch. But hey.</p><p>The real fun came when I tried to get the room dark enough to sleep. There was a light between the beds that I just couldn’t turn off. After 30 minutes of tired frustration I ended up calling the hotel reception. The operator told me not to be embarrassed – they get at least three such calls every evening – and described the precise location of the switch.</p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4ed2460200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="375" height="500" title="Light from Hell" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Light from Hell" src="/assets/image_78024.jpg" border="0"></a><p>The view from my room was over Trump Tower. Here it is by night:</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4c864ff200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="452" height="339" title="View over Trump Tower" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="View over Trump Tower" src="/assets/image_487588.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>By day I can’t help but feel it has a distinctly peach tint. Ha ha.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a49f32db200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="375" height="500" title="Trump Tower by day" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Trump Tower by day" src="/assets/image_106636.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>On Sunday I soon ended up enjoying the outdoors in Las Vegas. Here it is, for reference.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a49f3343200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="375" height="500" title="Blue skies in Vegas" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Blue skies in Vegas" src="/assets/image_215030.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>I picked up my badge at the hotel reception, which was very convenient.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4ed2061200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="375" height="500" title="Badge pickup" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Badge pickup" src="/assets/image_688941.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>The rest of the day was spent catching up with friends and colleagues, as well as meeting up with the Forge team for dinner.</p><p>Monday kicked off with the Forge DevCon&nbsp; mainstage.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4c8650f200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="452" height="339" title="Forge DevCon mainstage" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Forge DevCon mainstage" src="/assets/image_187647.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>As usual, Jim Quanci was first up on stage.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4ed2065200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="452" height="339" title="Mr Quanci doing his thing" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Mr Quanci doing his thing" src="/assets/image_236946.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>He quickly passed the reins across to our VP of Forge, Susanna Holt. She gave a really interesting presentation that related her experience as a competitive rower to the need for a stable platform.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4ed2069200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="452" height="339" title="Susanna Holt" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Susanna Holt" src="/assets/image_354404.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>One of the examples she showed was from Imaginit, and involved stairs. I’m including this picture because it has both virtual and physical stairs in it.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a49f32e6200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="452" height="339" title="Stairs" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Stairs" src="/assets/image_622029.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Eric Lam from DPR talked about – among other things – VueOps: digital twins are definitely a hot topic in the Forge space, these days.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4ed2071200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="452" height="339" title="VueOps" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="VueOps" src="/assets/image_435433.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Jimmy Forsberg from Skanska also talked about how realtime data – presented through Forge – is making a big difference to construction projects.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4ed2075200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="452" height="339" title="Skanska" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Skanska" src="/assets/image_18233.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>The three external presenters joined a panel moderated by Susanna to discuss their experiences using Forge.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a49f32ee200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="375" height="500" title="Panel photos" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Panel photos" src="/assets/image_269091.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>After the Forge mainstage I popped across to the Dynamo workshops. One was being delivered by Lilli Smith, Jaqueline Rohrmann, Alvaro Ortega Pickmans and Sylvester Knudsen.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a49f32f6200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="452" height="339" title="GD workshop by some old friends" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="GD workshop by some old friends" src="/assets/image_483142.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>This year there was a really fun exhibit area called The Village.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a49f32fe200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="452" height="339" title="More old friends in The Village" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="More old friends in The Village" src="/assets/image_761196.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>One of my favourite exhibits was an infinity room, which had an LED display on one wall, with the other walls, the floor and the ceiling all made of mirrors. Too cool!</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4c8651b200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="452" height="339" title="The Infinity Room" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="The Infinity Room" src="/assets/image_724764.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>There were artists creating caricatures digitally.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4c8651f200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="375" height="500" title="Caricatures" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Caricatures" src="/assets/image_914195.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>I also really enjoyed the retro video games area. Brought back some serious memories!</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a49f334b200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="452" height="339" title="The games corner" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="The games corner" src="/assets/image_457023.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>We had a reunion of sorts, when Wayne Wallace met with Kevin Vandecar and I for a drink. We were all working with AutoCAD OEM, way back when.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4ed20ce200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="452" height="339" title="OEM buddies" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="OEM buddies" src="/assets/image_883590.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>It was also really nice to meet Mercedes Carriquiry and Andy Robert – who I know from social media – as well as Adam, Autodesk’s other Walmsley. :-)</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4ed20d7200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="452" height="339" title="Walmsleys, Mercedes and Andy" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Walmsleys, Mercedes and Andy" src="/assets/image_573549.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>On Tuesday I somehow found myself running the AU5K for the first time. Utter lunacy, but I survived.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4ed4511200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="452" height="339" title="Kean, Paul and Shaan" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Kean, Paul and Shaan" src="/assets/image_721805.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>The day’s main event was clearly the AU mainstage. Andrew Anagnost, Autodesk’s CEO, presented a number of mind-expanding projects, including this Marriott hotel in New York that’s been built offsite with its modules assembled into a 26-storey building.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a49f3353200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="452" height="339" title="Andrew talking about modular hotel construction" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Andrew talking about modular hotel construction" src="/assets/image_577104.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Andrew also talked about how Autodesk helped VW reinvent the wheel for an electric concept camper van.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4ed20dc200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="452" height="339" title="Reinventing the wheel with VW" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Reinventing the wheel with VW" src="/assets/image_478615.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>I was very happy to see the fruits of The Living’s latest collaboration with Airbus on mainstage, this time focused on optimising the layout of one of their new factories.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4c86568200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="452" height="339" title="The Living's recent work with Airbus" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="The Living's recent work with Airbus" src="/assets/image_211102.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Elizabeth Hausler talked about her non-profit Build Change, while Asa Kalama talked about how Walt Disney Imagineering used Autodesk tools to design Star Wars Galaxy’s Edge theme park.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4c86571200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="452" height="339" title="Disney's Star Wars Galaxy's Edge" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Disney's Star Wars Galaxy's Edge" src="/assets/image_600833.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>It was a really compelling keynote, I found. Very inspiring stuff.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4c86575200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="452" height="339" title="Heading out" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Heading out" src="/assets/image_16731.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>I spent some time at the Ideas Exhange, trying out the VR experience <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2019/11/research-study-at-au-on-generative-design-in-vr-for-structural-engineering.html" target="_blank">I mentioned recently</a>. I can’t talk more about it, but I found it really interesting.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4c8657d200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="452" height="339" title="Researchers" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Researchers" src="/assets/image_482911.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>After the mainstage the Exhibit Hall opened, which was a great chance to see the VW bus that had just driven off mainstage. I really want one of these babies.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4c86581200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="452" height="339" title="The VW concept bus" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="The VW concept bus" src="/assets/image_9692.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>During the afternoon I spent most of my time in meetings, before heading to the Blogger Social, of which I somehow don’t have any photos. It was really fun catching up with so many old friends, though.</p>
