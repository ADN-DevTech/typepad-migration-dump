<p>We flew from Santiago as planned on Saturday morning at 9:30am, arriving at lunchtime (with a couple of hours saving thanks to the timezone change) on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_Island" target="_blank">Easter Island</a>.</p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b7c926cab0970b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Arriving on the island" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Arriving on the island" src="/assets/image_126388.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Along with Machu Picchu and Iguassu Falls, this was another destination for which we’d prearranged a tour with the travel agency from whom we bought our round-the-world tickets. Which was nice: it meant we had airport transfers, a hotel and a full-day tour of the island all organised. A welcome change after the logistics we constantly battled (through our own choice, admittedly) on the South American mainland.</p><p>Easter Island is our first stop in Polynesia – the others being Tahiti and New Zealand (I’m not sure if that’s strictly part of Polynesia, but it was certainly settled by the Polynesian people, of course) – and it’s interesting from a transitional perspective, in that – being part of Chile – it’s also part of South America, too. We certainly found it interesting to compare and contrast Easter Island to the rest of Chile, and to learn about the islanders’ sometimes complex relationship with the mainland.</p><p>After settling into our (very comfortable, by our standards) hotel, we were about to go and explore when our first medical emergency of the tour happened: our daughter, Anokhi, was eating peanuts while playing and one went down the wrong way. Luckily she coughed most of it up, but a small fragment (it turns out) got lodged in her airway below the oesophagus. Since <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2009/06/and-now-for-a-real-birthday.html" target="_blank">Anokhi’s birth</a> I’ve used the nickname of “peanut” for her – she seemed so very tiny when she was born – and the irony of this wasn’t lost on any of us. There’s some additional irony about having a medical emergency on an island that’s as remote as this one… here’s what Wikipedia has to say about this:</p><blockquote><p><em>Easter Island is one of the most remote inhabited islands in the world.<sup> </sup>The nearest inhabited land (around 50 residents in 2013) is </em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcairn_Island"><em>Pitcairn Island</em></a><em>, 2,075 kilometres (1,289 mi) away; the nearest town with a population over 500 is </em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rikitea"><em>Rikitea</em></a><em>, on the island of </em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mangareva"><em>Mangareva</em></a><em>, 2,606 km (1,619 mi) away; the nearest continental point lies in central Chile, 3,512 kilometres (2,182 mi) away.</em></p></blockquote><p>Great timing, you might say. We spent our first afternoon hanging around the emergency room while a junior doctor debated whether it made sense to go for a general anaesthetic (their only real option in this scenario, here, it seems) but in the end we opted to keep a close eye on her situation and come back in case anything changed for the worse.</p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201bb09c9e9f3970d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Our first emergency room" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Our first emergency room" src="/assets/image_67023.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>After this excitement we decided to wander into Hanga Roa, Easter Island’s one town. We were staying on the outskirts of the town, near the airport, and it was a quick walk down to the harbour. There are two moai there, one is restored to its original position – facing inwards, protecting the settlement – while the other is lying on its back.</p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b7c926cac3970b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Our first moai, down by the harbour in Hanga Roa" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Our first moai, down by the harbour in Hanga Roa" src="/assets/image_645622.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>The view from the restaurant at the harbour was spectacular. We stayed for a sunset dinner.<a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b7c926cac9970b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="The sun about to set" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="The sun about to set" src="/assets/image_373216.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201bb09c9ea24970d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="And the sunset" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="And the sunset" src="/assets/image_358289.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>It was interesting to be served bottled rainwater!</p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201bb09c9ea31970d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Drinking rainwater on Easter Island" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Drinking rainwater on Easter Island" src="/assets/image_101097.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>The next day we were up bright and early to start our tour.</p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201bb09c9ea40970d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Our bus" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Our bus" src="/assets/image_112466.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Our guide, Elisa, was German but married to a Rapa Nui (the term is apparently used not only for the island, but also the indigenous people and their language), which meant she was able to give insights that went far beyond what’s documented in academic research and guide books. We were really lucky to have her with us for the day.</p><p>The tour took us along the south coast of the island. Here are some snaps I took along the way.</p><p>At the quarry where moai were carved…</p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201bb09c9ea49970d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="At the quarry" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="At the quarry" src="/assets/image_425630.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b7c926cafc970b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Majestic" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Majestic" src="/assets/image_133026.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b8d2b129d2970c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="375" height="500" title="Profile" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Profile" src="/assets/image_23466.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b7c926cb1d970b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="There is just one bearded moai" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="There is just one bearded moai" src="/assets/image_421453.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Here you may be able to pick out a few moai that remain unfinished…</p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b8d2b129db970c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Some partially carved moai" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Some partially carved moai" src="/assets/image_924787.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Here’s another shot of the largest moai ever attempted – this one would have been absolutely huge – although it was never erected.</p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b7c926cb54970b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="The largest moai ever attempted, still a work in progress" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="The largest moai ever attempted, still a work in progress" src="/assets/image_970819.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>The platform at Ahu Tongariki.</p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b7c926cb61970b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="The amazing platform at Ahu Tongariki" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="The amazing platform at Ahu Tongariki" src="/assets/image_686483.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b7c926cb6e970b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="The back of the platform" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="The back of the platform" src="/assets/image_12806.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201bb09c9eabb970d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Petroglyphs and moai" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Petroglyphs and moai" src="/assets/image_752187.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Anakena beach.</p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201bb09c9eac0970d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="The moai at Anakena" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="The moai at Anakena" src="/assets/image_477634.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b7c926cb7a970b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="The backs of these moai" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="The backs of these moai" src="/assets/image_564551.jpg" border="0"></a><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b8d2b12acc970c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="A close up for some detail" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="A close up for some detail" src="/assets/image_176131.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p><br></p><p>It was an amazing tour. One thing I will say: I always imagined Easter Island to be windswept, but the day of our tour was exceptionally so. There were times when we struggled to keep our feet on the ground. Which was in itself part of the experience, of course.</p><p>On our own for the last day, we hiked up to Orongo: an inactive volcano containing a unique ecosystem, as well as a restored historical settlement.</p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b8d2b12b7a970c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="The caldera at Orongo" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="The caldera at Orongo" src="/assets/image_647652.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>This was a great way to burn some energy before taking the next flight onwards to Tahiti. I’m so happy we decided to include it on our tour… it’s like a dream-come-true for all of us to see the moai with our own eyes. I really hope we’ll get the chance to come back, one day.</p><p><em>By the way… if you’ve enjoyed these photos, you can see more (and more regularly) via </em><a href="http://instagram.com/monde_en_poche"><em>our Instagram page</em></a><em>.</em></p>
