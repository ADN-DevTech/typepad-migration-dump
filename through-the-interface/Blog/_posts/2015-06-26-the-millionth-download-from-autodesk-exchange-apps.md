The store has been running for a little over three years and is apparently home to over 1,800 apps in 14 languages that are available for download in 191 countries. Wow.</p>  <p>Be sure to check out <a href="https://apps.exchange.autodesk.com/ACD/en/Home/Index" target="_blank">Autodesk Exchange Apps for AutoCAD</a>, the largest of our various stores.</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b7c7a4e736970b-pi" target="_blank"><img title="One Million Downloads" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 20px auto; border-left: 0px; display: block; padding-right: 0px" border="0" alt="One Million Downloads" src="/assets/image_33240.jpg" width="404" height="279" /></a></p>  <p>Here’s a quick video celebrating this momentous event:</p>  <br />  <p align="center"><iframe height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tGSdphEzQ_o" frameborder="0" width="560" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>  <br />  <p>I’m about to head home from Singapore after a great week at the Autodesk Technical Summit 2015.
