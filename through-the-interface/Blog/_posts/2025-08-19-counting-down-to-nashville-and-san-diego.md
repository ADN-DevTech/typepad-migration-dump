<p>At the beginning of this week I recorded my class for Autodesk University 2025. It’s largely a repeat from my session at <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2025/05/devcon-europe-2025-in-amsterdam-days-1-2.html">DevCon 2025 in Amsterdam</a>, so if you attended that class then this one won’t be especially exciting (unless you’re like me and a second watch of something is actually really helpful, these days!).</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_717683.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="AU 2025 class title.png" src="/assets/image_717683.jpg" alt="AU 2025 class title." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Do you know my favourite thing so far about this year’s conference? My “class ID” is 1980. For some reason this fills me with a great deal of satisfaction. Go figure.</p>
<p>The in-person class will be held during the last session of Day 1 of AU (<strong>Tuesday September 17th</strong> at <strong>4:30pm CDT</strong> in the <em>Omni Legends A</em> room).</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_776807.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="My AU class.png" src="/assets/image_776807.jpg" alt="My AU class." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>For those of you not able to attend AU in person, this year, the class will also be available on-demand during the AU week. The class has a listing in the digital catalog under “1980-D”:</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_781634.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="My AU Digital class.png" src="/assets/image_781634.jpg" alt="My AU Digital class." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>You’ll find it under the On-Demand tab in the AU Digital experience, once it’s available.</p>
<p>As mentioned in <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2025/08/neuroscience-for-architecture-and-human-simulation-hiring-and-conferences.html">a recent post</a>, my AU experience this year will be shorter than usual: I’ll be heading from Nashville to San Diego on the Wednesday evening to attend <a href="https://anfarch.org/events/2025conference">ANFA 2025</a> from Thursday to Saturday. But I will be trying to <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2025/06/pre-conference-events-at-autodesk-university-2025.html">squeeze what I can out of my AU for this year</a>, which means hanging at the Dynamo &amp; APS Hackathon on the Monday and then heading across to the APS Leadership Forum at some point during the afternoon. I’m hoping to be able to catch up with old friends at both of these events.</p>
