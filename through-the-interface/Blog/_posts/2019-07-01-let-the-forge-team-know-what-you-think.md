Head on over to <a href="https://forge.autodesk.com/blog/forge-web-services-how-are-we-doing" target="_blank">the Forge blog</a> to find out more.</p><p>This is a great opportunity to let the team know your likes/dislikes/pet peeves with the existing API set, its documentation and code samples. What more do you need to be able to build your dream product with Forge? Be vocal – this feedback will help steer Autodesk’s Forge development priorities around Forge.</p><p>It should only take about 10 minutes to fill out, so please do so today; the results will be compiled and shared towards the end of July, so time is of the essence!</p>
