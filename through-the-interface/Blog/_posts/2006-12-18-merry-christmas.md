<p>I've just started an extended break with my family, so it's time for me to sign off and wish you all a very Merry Christmas (or Happy Holidays for those of you that are non-denominational in your festive activities) and the very best for 2007.</p>

<p>I'll be back online the week of January 8th (unless I end up having trouble keeping away :-), but in the meantime, here's <a href="http://www.elfyourself.com/?userid=907fc4a099bf81545f466f7G06121810">me making an elf of myself</a>.</p>
