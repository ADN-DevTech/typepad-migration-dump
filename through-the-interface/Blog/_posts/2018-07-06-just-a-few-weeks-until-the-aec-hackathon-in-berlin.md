<p>On July 20-22, 2018 I’ll be attending the AEC Hackathon in Berlin.</p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad37f03fd200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="224" title="AEC Hackathon in Berlin" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="AEC Hackathon in Berlin" src="/assets/image_928153.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Here’s some information&nbsp; about the event:</p><blockquote><p><em>The AEC (Architecture, Engineering and Construction) Hackathon is a weekend of geeking at its finest. It gives those designing, building and maintaining our built environment, the opportunity to engage, collaborate and interact on multiple aspects of the building industry. Not all built environment professionals have to code or have much background with tech. Just come with your knowledge, an open mind, collaborative spirit, and willingness to solve Mon-Fri problems leveraging various kinds of technology.</em></p><p><em>We’ve shaped an exhilarating Program on <u>Robotics</u>, <u>Generative Design</u>, <u>IOT</u>, <u>AR/VR</u> and <u>web services</u> for you!</em></p></blockquote><p>I really enjoyed my brief visit to <a href="http://www.keanw.com/2017/04/the-aec-hackathon-in-munich.html" target="_blank">last year’s AEC Hackathon held in Germany</a> – <a href="http://www.keanw.com/2017/03/aec-hackathon-is-coming-to-munich-and-so-am-i.html" target="_blank">which was held in Munich</a> – so I’m looking forward to spending more time at this one.<p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad39ed9e4200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="333" title="Last year's AEC Hackathon in Munich" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Last year's AEC Hackathon in Munich" src="/assets/image_166764.jpg" border="0"></a><p>I’ll even be staying a few extra days in the fine city of Berlin either side of the event with my wife and kids, so they’ll no doubt pass by the Hackathon at some point during the weekend to hang out.<p><a href="http://aechackathon-germany.de/#pricing" target="_blank">Get your tickets now</a> – they’re going quickly!
