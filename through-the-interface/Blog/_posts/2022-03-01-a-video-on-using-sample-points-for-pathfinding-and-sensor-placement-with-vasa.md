<p>Rhys Goldstein has now published <a href="https://youtu.be/cmlV-tdEkGA" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Part 5</a> in <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5DhpoI3HKE99RFSWsxsLVPHGqxQ5TVuc" rel="noopener" target="_blank">his video series</a> on using VASA. In it, Rhys walks through the latest two samples that come with <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2022/02/vasa-020-is-now-available.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">VASA 0.2.0</a>, one of which I talked a bit about in <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2022/02/placing-sensors-and-evaluating-their-coverage-using-vasa.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a recent post</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202942f9adb09200c-pi" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="VASA demo Part 5" height="313" src="/assets/image_469812.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; float: none; display: block;" title="VASA demo Part 5" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Both samples make use of sample points – one in the context of aggregating path information, while the other uses them (as we’ve seen) for sensor placement. Both workflows have significant potential for use in the context of generative design – something I hope to dig into at some point in another post.</p>

<p>Hopefully you’ll find this video – and the new features available in VASA 0.2.0 – valuable. Please do give this latest version of VASA a try and be sure to send feedback on where you’d like to see it go in the future.</p>
