<p>This week I had the chance to make a long-overdue first visit to Ireland. I flew across to Dublin for meetings with <a href="https://www.kingspan.com" target="_blank">Kingspan</a>, a large building products manufacturer.</p><p>Brian Glancy, Kingspan’s Head of BIM Strategy, had organised a session for the people working with BIM in the various Kingspan companies around the world. It was the first time most of the attendees had met one another, and the discussions were extremely interesting: most of the people there work with wildly different toolsets – most containing Autodesk tools, at some level, but many relying heavily on competitive products.</p><p>The event was held at <a href="https://youtu.be/o7gtYmAd7CI" target="_blank">Microsoft’s amazing new €134 million office</a> in the south of the city.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad38137a1200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Microsoft Dublin" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Microsoft Dublin" src="/assets/image_49657.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Here’s a shot of this impressive building at night.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad3a73e74200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Microsoft by night" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Microsoft by night" src="/assets/image_176120.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>The inside is even more impressive than the outside. What an amazing place to work!<a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad38137ae200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="What a building" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="What a building" src="/assets/image_282875.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>The central staircase with an LED floor beneath is really cool.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad3c6ea7c200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="375" height="500" title="Some nice features" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Some nice features" src="/assets/image_687402.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Most of the 2-day event was held at the Microsoft Technology Centre (MTC). The Microsoft team – particular John McCormack, Kingspan’s host – really went above and beyond to make us feel welcome.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad3c6ea81200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="The Microsoft Technology Centre" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="The Microsoft Technology Centre" src="/assets/image_787622.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>The environment was surprisingly cosy, especially with Christmas decorations everywhere.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad3c6f4bf200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="375" height="500" title="Very Christmassy" style="margin: 30px auto;

border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Azure IoT Suite dashboard" src="/assets/image_868017.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>For the presentations… there were many from people from Kingspan – of course – but I’ll focus mainly on the Autodesk sessions (as much as anything to avoid sharing information that should remain internal to Kingspan).</p><p>On the first day James Newman introduced the company and handed over to Marie Oliveira, who talked about our longer-term construction strategy.</p><p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad3a73e83200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="James Newman presenting Autodesk" style="margin: 30px auto;

border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Ikon plans" src="/assets/image_163030.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Anas Ayoub, who was visiting from Kingspan in Dubai on his first trip to Europe, talked about some amazing work they’ve been doing with Revit and Dynamo.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad3c6eb44200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Anas talking about the work on Middle-Eastern Kingspan projects" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Anas talking about the work on Middle-Eastern Kingspan projects" src="/assets/image_687325.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>As it was the first time both Anas and I had visited Ireland, Brian – who grew up in Dublin – very kindly took the time to show us the city.</p><p>Brian explained that real Irish pubs are often cramped, don’t have televisions playing sport and don’t serve food (beyond packets of crisps). They’re places for people to drink and interact.</p><p>To prove this with an extreme example, we started the evening at The Dawson Lounge. “Probably the smallest pub in the world.”</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad3c6f4c3200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="250" height="334" title="Brian at the Dawson Lounge" align="left" style="margin: 30px 0px; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: left; display: inline; background-image: none;" alt="Brian at the Dawson Lounge" src="/assets/image_40405.jpg" border="0"></a><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad3813fe4200c-pi" target="_blank"><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad3813fe4200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="250" height="335" title="Smallest pub in the World" align="right" style="margin: 30px 0px; border-image: none; float: right; display: inline; background-image: none;" alt="Smallest pub in the World" src="/assets/image_447873.jpg" border="0"></a><br><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad3c6eb49200b-pi" target="_blank"><br></a></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad3c6eb49200b-pi" target="_blank"><br></a></p><p>Inside we found a little space (it was <strong>really</strong> small) to wait for our pints to settle. We’d had some Guinness the night before, but it was hotel Guinness, and wasn’t significantly different from what I’ve had before elsewhere in the world.</p><p>This was different. It definitely had a taste and consistency that was very different from what I’ve been used to drinking.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad3c6eb49200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="375" height="501" title="Waiting to settle" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Waiting to settle" src="/assets/image_106285.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>After a quick pint in the Dawson, we headed across towards Grogans. The streets of Dublin are lovely on the lead-up to Christmas.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad3813834200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Dublin streets" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Dublin streets" src="/assets/image_788844.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad381383e200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="375" height="501" title="Dublin alleys" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Dublin alleys" src="/assets/image_687044.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>We went past the Pygmalion Pub and Restaurant, which apparently serves “Pygtails” rather than cocktails (haha).</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad3a73f13200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="375" height="500" title="The Pygmalion" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="The Pygmalion" src="/assets/image_668525.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Arriving at Grogans, we asked to share a table near the door, and were welcomed very warmly by <a href="http://www.liamdelaney.info/" target="_blank">Liam</a> and Gerry. Both are artists: Liam paints with oils and draws, while Gerry plays the guitar and mandolin (etc.).</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad3813842200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Good old boys" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Good old boys" src="/assets/image_921484.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>We only met them briefly – we had a dinner reservation we had to head to – but we could easily have stayed and talked for hours. Their genuine openness and friendly curiosity was really, really touching. Brian assures me that the kind of fleeting interaction was far from being a special event: if anything it’s the norm in this amazing country.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad3c6eb5b200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Kean with Liam" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Kean with Liam" src="/assets/image_895031.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>From here we headed to Brasserie Sixty6 for a very nice dinner where we were joined by Anand from Invicara. Afterwards we still had time (and space) for a few more, and so stopped by in The Long Hall, another Dublin institution. Brian took the time to educate us about what to look for in a pint of Guinness.</p><p>You can check the consistency of the head by tilting the glass, for instance.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad3c6eaa7200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Checking the head" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Checking the head" src="/assets/image_968546.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Warning: if you do think elsewhere in the world you’ll probably end up with wet feet.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad3c6eaa2200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="A good pint" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="A good pint" src="/assets/image_163257.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>The quality of the beer in the centre of Dublin was definitely something else.<a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad38137c6200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="I concur" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="I concur" src="/assets/image_177762.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Which should be evident from our happiness levels.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad3a73f20200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Anas, Brian and Kean" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Anas, Brian and Kean" src="/assets/image_156513.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>We stopped off at Bourke’s for one more, and tried to get another at The Bleeding Horse, but by that point it was too late to get served. So we headed back to the hotel for a nightcap.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad3a73ea2200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="375" height="500" title="The last round, back at the hotel" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="The last round, back at the hotel" src="/assets/image_643090.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Here’s my last shot of the day. Interesting that the beer stayed in focus while most other things are blurry. It’s probably a pretty good analogue for how my own visual system was working, by that point of the evening. And what an evening! I don’t think I could do it every week, but I enjoyed every single minute of it.</p><p>The following day I headed into town to visit Autodesk’s new Dublin office, which I’ll tell you about on Monday.</p><p>As I went through security in Dublin airport I had one last reminder of Kingspan, via the trays carrying my hand-baggage through security.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad3c6f4ca200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Kingspan are everywhere" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Kingspan are everywhere" src="/assets/image_214784.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Many, many thanks to Brian and his fellow BIM practioners at Kingspan for a memorable few days. I can’t wait to come back.</p><p>(Also thanks to Daniel Wood and Anas Ayoub for sharing photos for this post.)</p>
