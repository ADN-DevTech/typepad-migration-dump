<p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2008/06/getting-to-know.html">Some time ago</a> I looked into <a href="http://labs.autodesk.com/technologies/draw/">Project Draw</a>, our first foray into diagramming on the web. Today we released – again on <a href="http://labs.autodesk.com">Autodesk Labs</a> – our next-generation, web-based CAD tool…</p>  <p>You may have heard of <a href="http://labs.autodesk.com/technologies/dragonfly/">Dragonfly</a>, and possibly even <a href="http://machinedesign.com/article/3d-models-come-to-the-iphone-0112">Firefly</a>, well now it’s time to meet <a href="http://labs.autodesk.com/technologies/butterfly/">Butterfly</a>. [This makes me think of “<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj9JDL184kk">When I see an elephant fly</a>”, the song from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dumbo">Dumbo</a>, which happens to have been the first movie I ever saw at the cinema (not that I remember the event itself).]</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2012876f19ad3970c-pi"><img style="border-right-width: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; margin-left: auto; border-left-width: 0px; margin-right: auto" title="Butterfly" border="0" alt="Butterfly" src="/assets/image_268592.jpg" width="444" height="368" /></a> </p>  <p>For more information on Project Butterfly, check out <a href="http://labs.blogs.com/its_alive_in_the_lab/2010/01/project-butterfly-now-available.html">the announcement on Scott’s blog</a>. Of particular interest is this technology’s ability both to import DWG from and export it to your desktop (assuming you don’t want to just leave the data in the cloud).</p>  <p>I’ll be looking into Project Butterfly with great interest over the coming months – especially understanding its potential from an extensibility perspective – and recommend you take a few minutes to take a look and tell us what you think (and want!).</p>  <p><strong><em>Update</em></strong></p>  <p>I’ve just found out about <a href="http://youtube.com/autodeskbutterfly">the Project Butterfly YouTube channel</a>, in case anyone’s interested in watching some video content on this technology.</p>
