We’re still very much at the beginning of this journey and this conference is a great opportunity to be part of it: you can get in on the ground floor and participate actively in this important industry shift.</p> <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b7c818bceb970b-pi" target="_blank"><img title="Forge Logo" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; float: left; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 10px 20px 10px 10px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="Forge Logo" src="/assets/image_120675.jpg" width="155" align="left" height="158"></a>We’re expecting upwards of 1,100 developers (from more than 700 companies) to attend… I was surprised at how many European developers at the recent DevDays event in Munich mentioned to me that they were already planning on attending, so I expect it to be a really interesting, international crowd.</p> <p>I’m helping plan the AR &amp; VR content for the DevCon (and will probably contribute in some way to content related to IoT), but I’ll also be there in person to learn about this new wave of technologies and to meet with other attendees. I’m also very much looking forward to attending the <a href="http://3dwebfest.com" target="_blank">3D Web Fest</a>: I wasn’t able to be at <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2015/05/charity-begins-in-the-office.html" target="_blank">the first one</a>, held last year, and I’m going to try hard not to miss the second.</p> <p>If you’re considering attending the DevCon, it’s worth looking at picking up your ticket soon… There’s an early-bird discount available – standard tickets are $499 and and VIP tickets $699 before <strong>April 8</strong> – as well as a special group discount for ADN members (check your latest DevNews for details).</p>
