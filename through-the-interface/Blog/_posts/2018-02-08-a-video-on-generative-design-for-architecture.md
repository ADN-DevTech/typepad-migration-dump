<p>The project I’m currently working on fits squarely under the umbrella of “Generative Design for Architecture”. We’re using Dynamo Studio to generate layouts of residential housing – including both individual homes and apartment buildings – with the results quantified in a number of metrics that will be easily explorable by the user of the system. It’s the approach <a href="https://autodeskresearch.com/groups/living" target="_blank">The Living</a> – the architectural studio in <a href="https://autodeskresearch.com" target="_blank">Autodesk Research</a> doing pioneering work in the generative design space – has used for a number of projects, including <a href="https://www.autodeskresearch.com/projects/project-discover" target="_blank">Project Discover</a> and the <a href="https://autodeskuniversity.smarteventscloud.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=124721" target="_blank">layout of the AU 2017 Exhibit Hall</a>.</p><p>I came across this video, earlier today, that really does a nice job of communicating what generative design means to some people working in the AEC space. Enjoy!</p><p><center><iframe name="wistia_embed" width="480" height="270" class="wistia_embed" src="https://fast.wistia.com/embed/iframe/zzmwjjpp15" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowtransparency="true"></iframe></center>
