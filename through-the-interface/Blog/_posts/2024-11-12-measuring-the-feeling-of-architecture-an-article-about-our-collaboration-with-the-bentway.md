<p>A year or so ago <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2023/11/capturing-the-human-experience-of-the-built-environment.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">I posted about our collaboration with The Bentway</a>, and how it kicked off some really interesting research into combining qualitative and quantitative data collected during efforts to measure the human experience of the built environment.</p>

<p>Members of our team have been working hard with our talented research communications colleagues to create <a href="https://www.research.autodesk.com/collaborations/the-bentway/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">this interesting, in-depth article describing the collaboration</a>. It complements the existing <a href="https://www.research.autodesk.com/projects/bentway/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">project page</a> that has been up for a while now.</p>

<p>Between these two pages we now have a couple of videos describing the project. The <a href="https://youtu.be/S1H0F1WIxm8" rel="noopener" target="_blank">first</a> shorter overview was from last year:</p>

<p>The <a href="https://youtu.be/4NTytIHnolY" rel="noopener" target="_blank">second</a>, longer - and more recently published - video, goes into more depth:</p>

<p>This was a fantastic project for the Autodesk Research team; we’re very grateful for our partners at The Bentway - to Josh Haskamp, Robert McKaye and the whole team there - &#0160;for the opportunity to collaborate on this exciting endeavour. We learned a lot, both in terms of the kind of infrastructure you need to build to collect, process and connect large amounts of subjective, multi-modal data but also how this kind of activity can lead to greater community engagement. We’re really excited about the potential for this kind of technology for increased stakeholder engagement and even participatory design activities.</p>
<p><em>The following Autodesk researchers were involved in this project:</em></p>
