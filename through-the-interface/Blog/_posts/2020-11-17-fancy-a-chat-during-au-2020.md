<p>And so it begins: today is the first day of <a href="https://autodeskuniversity.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Autodesk University 2020</a> (at least in the US), to be enjoyed (most probably) from the comfort of your home office or living room. We are now at well over 100,000 registrations, which is simply unbelievable.</p>
<p>Many on Twitter are lamenting (or more likely relishing) the fact they’re not travelling to Las Vegas, dealing with jetlag, dehydration, cracked lips (viva los chapstick), lack of daylight (not good when dealing with the aforementioned jetlag), passive smoke inhalation, slot machine noise pollution and, yes, alcohol poisoning. I do miss the in-person contact with like-minded people, but I’m actually expecting this week to be “good enough”: ideally good enough to enable more virtual participation in the future, but not so good that we’ll never meet again. Time will tell. :-)</p>
<p>As mentioned <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2020/11/its-time-to-build-your-au-2020-schedule.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">recently</a>, I have <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/autodesk-university/class/Lessons-Project-Dasher-Building-Digital-Twin-Using-Forge-2020" rel="noopener" target="_blank">my class Q&amp;A</a> scheduled for <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/autodesk-university/class/Lessons-Project-Dasher-Building-Digital-Twin-Using-Forge-2020#add-to-calendar" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Wednesday</a>, but beyond that I’ve signed up to hang out at the Forge AnswerBar: part of my thinking was that it would be a good opportunity to deal with questions from anyone not able to join the scheduled Q&amp;A but having questions about <a href="https://dasher360.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Project Dasher</a> and how we’ve used Forge. That said, I’m open to discussing pretty much anything.</p>
<p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20263e9783027200b-pi" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Kean at the Forge AnswerBar" border="0" height="281" src="/assets/image_887815.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="Kean at the Forge AnswerBar" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Here are my AnswerBar timeslots (in just GMT and PST, to save bandwidth ;-). Each is a link to a calendar file including the link to the AnswerBar, which should make it easier to work out your local time:</p>

<ul>
<li>The second half of this coincides with the opening AU keynote, so it could well be quiet.</li>

</ul>
<p>If you don’t have questions about Forge – but just fancy a chat – then please still feel free to stop by. I’m sure we can find a topic to discuss – even if it’s <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2020/10/floppy-friday-1.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">playing</a> <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2020/11/floppy-friday-2.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Commodore 64</a> <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2020/11/floppy-friday-3.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">games</a> – so don’t be shy.</p>
