<p>Things are moving ahead regarding the VR room we’re building at Autodesk in Neuchatel. Come mid-January we’ll be ready to welcome guests to the Neuchatel office and get them excited about the potential of applying Virtual Reality technology in the design space.</p> <p>This week we had Joel Pennington visit from the Autodesk LIVE team in San Francisco: he trained a number of people from the Neuchatel office on how to use the VR system and went through demos that showcase a variety of Autodesk tools and technologies. </p> <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b7c8bd3638970b-pi" target="_blank"><img title="Joel explaining something interesting" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 30px auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="Joel explaining something interesting" src="/assets/image_404766.jpg" width="500" height="281"></a></p> <p>The breadth of demos we now have available is impressive and getting bigger by the day. AU 2016 helped a lot, as a number of demos were prepared specifically for the event.</p> <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201bb09602103970d-pi" target="_blank"><img title="VR can be fun" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 30px auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="VR can be fun" src="/assets/image_887963.jpg" width="500" height="281"></a></p> <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b7c8bd3644970b-pi" target="_blank"><img title="Trying some demos myself" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 30px auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="Trying some demos myself" src="/assets/image_1169.jpg" width="500" height="281"></a></p> <p>The VR room itself is nearly ready, too. The last masonry work has been done, and the glass doors will be fitted in early January. We’ve ordered some furniture, too, to make it nice and cosy.</p> <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b7c8bd3653970b-pi" target="_blank"><img title="The VR room is getting there, steadily" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 30px auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="The VR room is getting there, steadily" src="/assets/image_574218.jpg" width="500" height="281"></a></p> <p>After training the Autodesk team on VR, Joel and I went along to see a local architecture firm, Herzog &amp; De Meuron, to see how they’re implementing VR today. They’re based in Basel and it was late afternoon by the time we arrived.</p> <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b7c8bd3657970b-pi" target="_blank"><img title="Our tram in Basel" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 30px auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="Our tram in Basel" src="/assets/image_860573.jpg" width="500" height="281"></a></p> <p>It was a fun session at HdM. We were in their library – with quite a few people coming through, many of whom stopped to watch what was happening. Both Joel and I had HoloLens devices with us, so we ended up doing hands-on demos of prototype HoloLens applications for each of the attendees, too.</p> <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b8d246ebab970c-pi" target="_blank"><img title="Meeting with members of the HdM team" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 30px auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="Meeting with members of the HdM team" src="/assets/image_488327.jpg" width="500" height="281"></a></p> <p>Joel headed onwards to Zurich for his flight to Munich, while I headed back to Neuchatel to watch Rogue One. I really, really liked this film. If you’re also a Star Wars fan, be sure to check it out!</p>
