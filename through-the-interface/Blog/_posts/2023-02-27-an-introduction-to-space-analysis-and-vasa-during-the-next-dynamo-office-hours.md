<p>During the next Dynamo Office Hours – being held on March 9th, 2023 at 1pm EST – Rhys Goldstein and I will be joining Tiana Dame, Sol Amour and Jacob Small to talk about “Packages of Note”, which will include an introduction to the Space Analysis and <a href="https://keanw.com/VASA" target="_blank">VASA</a> packages.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202b6852aa728200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="281" title="Dynamo Office Hours with Sol, Jacob, Rhys and Kean" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Dynamo Office Hours with Sol, Jacob, Rhys and Kean" src="/assets/image_532795.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>I’m sure it’s going to be a fun event – it’s always a blast catching up with Sol and Jacob – and a good chance to learn about a few Dynamo packages developed and maintained by Autodesk.</p><p>The focus will be on introducing the various packages – rather than going into great depth regarding low-level algorithms and implementation optimisations – but we’ll certainly answer any questions people have, and will also share some useful resources for folks wanting to dig a little deeper.</p><p>To join us on March 9th you can <a href="https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/community-conversations/dynamo-office-hours-packages-of-a-note/ec-p/11779491#M668" target="_blank">sign up here</a>.
