<p>On Thursday we celebrated Autodesk’s presence in Neuchatel together, one last time, at the official <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2017/12/the-end-of-an-era-for-autodesk-switzerland.html" target="_blank">office closing</a> party. It was held at the <a href="http://beaulac.ch/en/restaurants/waves/" target="_blank">new bar</a> on top of the <a href="http://beaulac.ch/en/" target="_blank">Beaulac Hotel</a>… a fitting venue, in some ways, as this was for many of us the first place we stayed when we first visited Neuchatel for our job interviews (it certainly was mine: I stayed here back in July 1995 when I came across for my 2nd-round interview to join Autodesk UK, some years before <a href="http://www.keanw.com/2018/03/celebrating-a-20-year-journey.html" target="_blank">I moved here</a>).</p><p>Anyway, the new bar is really nice, with interesting decor…</p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad37dbcd8200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Bubbles" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Bubbles" src="/assets/image_273655.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad39da3cb200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Fun decor" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Fun decor" src="/assets/image_581175.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>… and stunning views:</p><p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad37dbce0200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="The view towards town" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="The view towards town" src="/assets/image_300812.jpg" border="0"></a></p></p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad39da3d7200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="And towards the lake" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="And towards the lake" src="/assets/image_432156.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>It was a little windy, that day, so we split our time between the outside area…</p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad357ce85200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Cheers" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Cheers" src="/assets/image_884112.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>… and the bar:<a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad37dbcf1200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="The bar" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="The bar" src="/assets/image_667571.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>There were some very interesting drinks on offer, too.</p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad357ce8d200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="375" height="500" title="Cocktails" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Cocktails" src="/assets/image_333988.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad39da3ed200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Happy faces" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Happy faces" src="/assets/image_581109.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad37dbd09200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Shades" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Shades" src="/assets/image_504613.jpg" border="0"></a><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad39da3fa200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Smiles" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Smiles" src="/assets/image_24284.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>We did assemble for a group photo, but I haven’t been able to track down the phone it was taken with.

I know I’ll be staying in contact with many of the people who are leaving (or have left) Autodesk this year, but for sure we’ll never have another event like this. Thank you to Autodesk for the years we’ve all had here together and for the fitting send-off for all those whose current tour with the company is ending. And a huge THANK YOU to everyone who has made Autodesk Neuchatel <u><strong>the</strong></u> best place to work, over the years. Those of us who are staying with the company will miss you more than you can know, as you go off and do <a href="http://keanw.com/2018/06/life-after-autodesk-neuchtel.html" target="_blank">great things</a>. Please keep in touch!</p>
