<p>In <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2025/04/boston.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the last post</a> I talked about arriving in Boston. I’ve deliberately skipped the reason we were in Boston - and in San Francisco afterwards, too - as I’ll cover those in an upcoming post.</p>
<p>I do want to spend some time talking about what we did between Boston and SF, though. When I originally looked at the options for this trip, I first thought about spending the weekend in Baltimore with my son: it turns out he’s in full-on exam period, though, so it wouldn’t have been the best time to visit, to say the least. Besides that he’ll be back in Switzerland in roughly 3 weeks, so it didn’t make much sense to make the detour.</p>
<p>I also wanted to get onto Pacific time as quickly as possible, as that would help with the jetlag ahead of Tuesday's SF event. One option was heading directly to SF, but when we looked into hotels there was a) poor availability in the city itself and b) what there was was *really* expensive. (I’ve since found out the reason was <a href="https://www.rsaconference.com/usa" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an RSA conference</a> at the Moscone Center. Thanks, Hilmar!)</p>
<p>As Autodesk is the official provider of the Design &amp; Make platform for the LA28 Olympic Games - and a sponsor of Team USA - we decided it would be a good use of time to visit Los Angeles and tour several of the games’ venues.</p>
<p>My colleague Dagmara and I therefore booked a stop in LAX between BOS and SFO. On Saturday morning, after Boston’s event, we got up in the rain to take the 8:30am flight out of Logan Airport.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_104165.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Leaving our Boston hotel" src="/assets/image_104165.jpg" alt="Leaving our Boston hotel." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Arriving in LAX we were picked up by our guide, Yuri, who we’d booked for a 5-hour tour of LA28 venues.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_507308.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Arriving in LAX" src="/assets/image_507308.jpg" alt="Arriving in LAX." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>The main purpose of the Saturday afternoon tour was to get an overall view of as many venues as possible, but not necessarily to spend much time at any particular one.</p>
<p>We started in Inglewood, where we drove past the <a href="https://la28.org/en/games-plan/venues/arena-inglewood.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Intuit Dome</a>. This will house LA28’s basketball.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_862673.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Intuit Dome" src="/assets/image_862673.jpg" alt="Intuit Dome." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>We then stopped by the <a href="https://la28.org/en/games-plan/venues/stadium-inglewood.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SoFi Stadium</a>, which is currently closed to tours because of Beyoncé’s concert tour. This will - somewhat interestingly! - host the swimming for LA28.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_622657.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="SoFi Stadium" src="/assets/image_622657.jpg" alt="SoFi Stadium." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_347026.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Dagmara and Kean at the SoFi Stadium" src="/assets/image_347026.jpg" alt="Dagmara and Kean at the SoFi Stadium." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_799261.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Another view" src="/assets/image_799261.jpg" alt="Another view." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>As we drove onwards we saw an area where people were living in tents beneath an intersection of raised highways.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_18345.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Tents under a highway bridge" src="/assets/image_18345.jpg" alt="Tents under a highway bridge." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Our next stop was at the University of Southern California (USC).</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_637453.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="USC" src="/assets/image_637453.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a>The two main USC venues being used for LA28 are The Galen Center and the LA Memorial Coliseum (which is owned by the LA County but operated by USC).</p>
<p><a href="https://la28.org/en/games-plan/venues/usc-sports-center.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Galen Center</a> will host badminton and rhythmic gymnastics.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_230769.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Galen Center" src="/assets/image_230769.jpg" alt="Galen Center." width="375" height="500" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>After this we stopped for Mexican food at Trejo’s Cantina.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_222589.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Trejo's Cantina" src="/assets/image_222589.jpg" alt="Trejo's Cantina." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>After a solid lunch we headed up towards the UCLA campus. On the way I saw an interesting billboard from Netflix referring to a show called “You”, the final season of which I happened to be watching.<a href="/assets/image_95116.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Netflix billboard" src="/assets/image_95116.jpg" alt="Netflix billboard." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>The LA28 Athelete’s Village will be located on the UCLA campus, presumably in student dormitories.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_631809.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="UCLA campus" src="/assets/image_631809.jpg" alt="UCLA campus." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>At this point we were 4 hours into our tour. Yuri took us to Santa Monica for a view over the Pacific Ocean before dropping us at our hotel near Venice Beach.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_194273.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="With Yuri in Santa Monica" src="/assets/image_194273.jpg" alt="With Yuri in Santa Monica." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>After having spent 6+ hours in a plane followed by basically 5 hours in a car, Dagmara and I enjoyed a lovely walk through the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venice_Canal_Historic_District" target="_blank" rel="noopener">historic canal district</a> of Venice, California. Yes, they’re the reason it’s called Venice - the original developer was inspired by the Italian original and wanted to recreate something like it in LA.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_42169.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Venice Beach canals" src="/assets/image_42169.jpg" alt="Venice Beach canals." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>I’d forgotten that my favorite snowboard manufacturer is headquartered in Venice Beach.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_25090.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Officially the end of the season" src="/assets/image_25090.jpg" alt="Officially the end of the season." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>I really like Arbor Snowboards, so was very happy to go in and visit.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_970059.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="The home of Arbor Snowboards" src="/assets/image_970059.jpg" alt="The home of Arbor Snowboards." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Venice Pier is a great place to see the sunset over the ocean.<a href="/assets/image_471537.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Sunset surfers" src="/assets/image_471537.jpg" alt="Sunset surfers." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a><a href="/assets/image_611468.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Venice Beach rainbow" src="/assets/image_611468.jpg" alt="Venice Beach rainbow." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_711520.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Baywatch vibes" src="/assets/image_711520.jpg" alt="Baywatch vibes." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a>So that was last Saturday, our first day in LA.</p>
<p>After a good night’s sleep we were up bright an early to meet an old friend and former Autodesk Research colleague, Merten Stroetzel, for breakfast at The Cow’s End Cafe.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_134210.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Kean, Dagmara and Merten" src="/assets/image_134210.jpg" alt="Kean, Dagmara and Merten." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>I first worked with Merten over a decade ago, when he was in our Automotive Consulting team. We worked together on the project where we <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2014/03/autodesk-and-morgan-at-the-geneva-motor-show.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">took a VRED-based configurator for Morgan 3 Wheelers to the Geneva Motorshow</a>. That project was <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2014/03/configuring-3-wheelers-at-the-geneva-motor-show.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a lot of fun</a>!</p>
<p>It was really good to see Merten again. Since leaving Autodesk he’s been working on <a href="https://foil.zone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">electric hydrofoils</a>, among other things. This has been a tough year for him, as he lost his home in the Pacific Palisades to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palisades_Fire" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the recent wildfire</a>.</p>
<p>Merten offered to take us up to see where he used to live in his Sprinter van.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_200845.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Merten and Kean" src="/assets/image_200845.jpg" alt="Merten and Kean." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>We’re smiling in these photos - as it was genuinely so great to see Merten after several years - but as you might expect the scenes we were about to see were really sobering.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_971252.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="In the Sprinter" src="/assets/image_971252.jpg" alt="In the Sprinter." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Access to the Palisades is controlled: you need to have a resident’s permit to go up there. Merten still has his, although he’s now living in Santa Monica.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_131610.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Going through the checkpoint" src="/assets/image_131610.jpg" alt="Going through the checkpoint." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Every time Merten goes up there more has been cleared from the devastated lots up there, but it’s still a shocking sight.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_743961.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Shocking" src="/assets/image_743961.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>You’ll occasionally see a building that - at least visibly - seems not to have been touched, but they are few and far between.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_670679.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Devastation" src="/assets/image_670679.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>This is where Merten’s apartment stood.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_227935.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Building remains" src="/assets/image_227935.jpg" alt="Building remains." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>He lost two vehicles in the fire: one was a van he’d fitted out for his partner’s business.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_672132.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Merten's partner's truck" src="/assets/image_672132.jpg" alt="Merten's partner's truck." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Merten lost so much in the fire, I can only imagine what he’s been through over the last few months.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_137585.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Merten's old apartment" src="/assets/image_137585.jpg" alt="Merten's old apartment." width="375" height="500" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Being a proper Maker, Merten had a whole garage full of tools and projects that were lost.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_224008.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Some old tools from the rubble" src="/assets/image_224008.jpg" alt="Some old tools from the rubble." width="375" height="500" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>The heat was so intense, it even melted aluminium and shards of solar panels from his partner's van.<a href="/assets/image_972602.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="A piece of solar panel" src="/assets/image_972602.jpg" alt="A piece of solar panel." width="375" height="500" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>I can’t fully describe the feeling of being up there. On the one hand there was this deep sense of loss - a fraction of what the homeowners and residents must have felt, of course - but also some optimism for the future: so much is being done to move past this horrific disaster, and there are “Pali Strong” flags everywhere declaring the locals’ love for their home. I got the real sense that - however long it takes - the Pacific Palisades will bounce back from this.</p>
<p>After heading back down towards the ocean, Dagmara and I headed back to Marina Del Rey, where we met with David and Burçin Gerber for a walk along the water.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_307049.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="In Marina Del Rey with Burcin and David" src="/assets/image_307049.jpg" alt="In Marina Del Rey with Burcin and David." width="375" height="500" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>I have known David for many years - primarily through SimAUD, the Symposium for Simulation in Architecture and Urban Design - but it was my first time meeting Burçin.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_997751.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Kean, David, Burcin and Dagmara" src="/assets/image_997751.jpg" alt="Kean, David, Burcin and Dagmara." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Along the walk we saw an Ocean Cleanup vessel.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_795332.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="An Ocean Cleanup vessel" src="/assets/image_795332.jpg" alt="An Ocean Cleanup vessel." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>We had time for a quick (but really good!) Italian lunch before heading onwards to our 4pm tour of the <a href="https://la28.org/en/games-plan/venues/arena-downtown-los-angeles.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Crypto.com Arena</a> (formerly called the Staples Center). This venue will host boxing and artistic-/trampoline-gymnastics.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_571823.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Cybertruck at the Crypto dot com arena" src="/assets/image_571823.jpg" alt="Cybertruck at the Crypto dot com arena." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>This was a fun tour. Dagmara and I were expecting to be part of a larger group, but it ended up being just the two of us. With three tour guides!</p>
<p>We have very different interests from your typical group touring the venue. We were more interested in the sensory pods - to provide relief for neuro-diverse visitors when overwhelmed by the crowds - and the lactation pods than we were by the sports.<a href="/assets/image_201962.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Sensory Pod" src="/assets/image_201962.jpg" alt="Sensory Pod." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a><a href="/assets/image_312497.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Lactation Pod" src="/assets/image_312497.jpg" alt="Lactation Pod." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a>To demonstrate just how extreme this was, Dagmara and I were asked to name people on the below mural. Dagmara managed to name Taylor Swift and I nearly said Adele (but I wasn’t 100% sure on that, so didn’t). The guides probably realised this was going to be quite a different tour, at this point.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_609884.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Kean and Dagmara touring Crypto dot com Arena" src="/assets/image_609884.jpg" alt="Kean and Dagmara touring Crypto dot com Arena." width="375" height="500" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>The tour was fantastic. We got to see many different types of seating and hospitality - of which there are a really wide variety.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_761181.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Visiting a suite" src="/assets/image_761181.jpg" alt="Visiting a suite." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>The Arena is used for ice hockey, basketball but also concerts, etc. When there's a hockey-basketball double-header they can turn it around in just 90 minutes!<a href="/assets/image_244501.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="The Arena is ready for hockey" src="/assets/image_244501.jpg" alt="The Arena is ready for hockey." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>I really enjoyed this tour, I have to say. The staff seem highly competent and will have no problem dealing with the games.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_408876.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="From the press box" src="/assets/image_408876.jpg" alt="From the press box." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_565142.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="A really VIP tour" src="/assets/image_565142.jpg" alt="A really VIP tour." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a>We got to sit in the seats used by the players, although we stopped short of jumping over the boards onto the ice.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_344880.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="From the player's seats" src="/assets/image_344880.jpg" alt="From the player's seats." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>One of the coolest locations was a tunnel suite, which can be accessed by the ramp used by the players and other VIPs.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_306144.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Heading to a tunnel suite" src="/assets/image_306144.jpg" alt="Heading to a tunnel suite." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Here’s the suite itself.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_855087.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="A tunnel suite" src="/assets/image_855087.jpg" alt="A tunnel suite." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>From here you have direct access to seats with a great view over the ice, as you might expect.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_896352.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Steps to the arena" src="/assets/image_896352.jpg" alt="Steps to the arena." width="375" height="500" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>When we were finished with the tour we decided to check a few of the nearby venues. Across the street was an unfinished development called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceanwide_Plaza" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oceanwide Plaza</a> that was <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/10/style/graffiti-oceanwide-plaza-los-angeles-skyscrapers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">covered in graffiti</a>. I hope they manage to do something with this before the games!<a href="/assets/image_900197.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Aborted housing project in downtown LA" src="/assets/image_900197.jpg" alt="Aborted housing project in downtown LA." width="375" height="500" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>We visited the <a href="https://la28.org/en/games-plan/venues/convention-center.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LA Convention Center</a>, which will host fencing, judo, table tennis, taekwondo and wrestling.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_519858.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="LA Convention Center" src="/assets/image_519858.jpg" alt="LA Convention Center." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a>There was a conference wrapping up, as far as I could tell, so we just wandered in and took a few snaps.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_221729.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Entering the LA Convention Center" src="/assets/image_221729.jpg" alt="Entering the LA Convention Center." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a>The space is just one of those configurable exhibition spaces of the sort we use for Autodesk University, every year.<a href="/assets/image_523424.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Inside the LA Convention Center" src="/assets/image_523424.jpg" alt="Inside the LA Convention Center." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>We couldn’t get into the <a href="https://la28.org/en/games-plan/venues/theater.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Peacock Theater</a> - where some early boxing rounds and weightlifting will be held - but we peered through the glass doors.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_14076.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="The Peacock Theater" src="/assets/image_14076.jpg" alt="The Peacock Theater." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>And that was it for the Sunday. Another intense day.</p>
<p>On the Monday - our last day in LA - we have a breakfast meeting in mid-city before heading across to the <a href="https://la28.org/en/games-plan/venues/la-memorial-coliseum.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LA Memorial Coliseum</a>, which will host track and field and participate in the opening and/or closing ceremonies.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_181425.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Touring the Coliseum" src="/assets/image_181425.jpg" alt="Touring the Coliseum." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>There were more people on this tour.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_747240.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="The view across the pitch" src="/assets/image_747240.jpg" alt="The view across the pitch." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Once again we visited many hospitality options, the most impressive being the USC President’s Suite.</p>

<p>The venue is operated on a long-term lease by USC.</p>

<p>We also got to experience the locker rooms, for whatever that’s worth. It’s interesting that there’s a stark disparity between the locker rooms for the home and away teams: the mind-games aren’t just for the pitch, it seems.</p>

<p>Here we are at the ground level, although to host athletics the level will be raised considerably to give more surface area.</p>

Public transport is going to be such a huge component of the car-free LA28 games that it would have seemed wrong to have driven everywhere.</p>
<p>On the way to the station we saw the new <a href="https://www.lucasmuseum.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lucas Museum of Narrative Art</a>. Which really looks like it landed from one of George’s movies.</p>

<p>I look forward to visiting it once it opens in 2026!</p>

<p>Here we are taking the train to Culver City.<a href="/assets/image_956423.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Taking the Metro Rail to Culver City" src="/assets/image_956423.jpg" alt="Taking the Metro Rail to Culver City." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>It was straightforward enough, although you did see people sleeping on benches here and there. Something the city will probably “clean up” for the games.</p>

<p>From Culver City we took a Lyft to UCLA once again - via Venice Beach to pick up our luggage - where we visited the cityLAB.<a href="/assets/image_15518.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="UCLA's cityLAB" src="/assets/image_15518.jpg" alt="UCLA's cityLAB." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>The cityLAB team was in a basement (but with a nice green view!) office of Perloff Hall.<a href="/assets/image_724472.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Perloff Hall at UCLA" src="/assets/image_724472.jpg" alt="Perloff Hall at UCLA." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>From here we got one last ride down to LAX, from where we hopped northwards to SFO.<a href="/assets/image_173061.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="A nice tree" src="/assets/image_173061.jpg" alt="A nice tree." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a>It was a jam-packed few days in LA but I feel we got to experience a lot. Many thanks to my partner-in-crime, Dagmara Szkurlat, for doing most of the legwork on setting up meetings and arranging visits for this trip. It was intense but really valuable!</p>
