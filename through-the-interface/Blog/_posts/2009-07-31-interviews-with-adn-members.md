<p>Back at last year’s AU, my manager (Jim Quanci) and I were asked to interview members of the Autodesk Developer Network for the <a href="http://autocad.autodesk.com">AutoCAD Exchange</a> site.</p>  <p>Here are a couple of those interviews that I came across on YouTube, both with long-time Autodesk development partners.</p>  <p>First up is an interview with Rob Smith from <a href="http://www.sprinkcad.com">SprinkCAD</a>.</p> <object width="480" height="292"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/szv1w4WZt_w&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/szv1w4WZt_w&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="480" height="292"></embed></object>  <p>And now Jim interviews Christian Dubuc from <a href="http://www.2020technologies.com">20-20 Technologies</a>.</p> <object width="480" height="292"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/_DVqbO_FujE&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/_DVqbO_FujE&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="480" height="292"></embed></object>  <p>Overall I do prefer preparing written interviews: with a video interview I find it hard to listen, think and then talk, especially when the interviews are unscripted and shot in one take, as these were. Even so, it was really a fun experience… a big thank you to both Rob and Christian for taking the time to talk to us!</p>
