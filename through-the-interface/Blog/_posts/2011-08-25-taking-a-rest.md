<p>Actually, I wish that were true. I’m planning on taking some time off in October, but that seems a long way off, at this stage.</p>
<p>What I’ve actually been doing is working with some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer" target="_blank">REST</a>-based APIs: firstly, I’ve been finishing up work on September’s <a href="http://labs.autodesk.com/utilities/ADN_plugins" target="_blank">Plugin of the Month</a>, TransTips for AutoCAD, Revit, Inventor, &amp; 3ds Max (to be posted on <a href="http://labs.autodesk.com" target="_blank">Autodesk Labs</a> in the next few days). TransTips makes use of the REST API for <a href="http://microsofttranslator.com" target="_blank">Bing Translator</a>, to <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2011/07/automatic-translation-of-autocad-tooltips-using-net.html" target="_blank">automatically</a> <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2011/07/translating-tooltips-in-both-autocad-and-revit-using-net.html" target="_blank">translate</a>&#0160;<a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2011/07/translating-tooltips-inside-autocad-inventor-and-revit-using-net.html" target="_blank">tooltips</a> in <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2011/08/translating-tooltips-in-autocad-inventor-revit-and-3ds-max-using-net.html" target="_blank">various products</a>.</p>
<p>Secondly, perhaps more excitingly, I’ve been coding against a possible future web service API for <a href="http://labs.autodesk.com/utilities/photo_scene_editor" target="_blank">Project Photofly</a>. Formulating all sorts of REST calls to create photo scenes, upload images, process the scenes and get the resulting point clouds and meshes in various formats. All tied together with a fancy <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Presentation_Foundation" target="_blank">WPF</a> user interface and plenty of <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/async" target="_blank">asynchrony</a> to keep the application responsive.</p>
<p>Lots of fun, but not yet ready for posting to this blog, unfortunately.</p>
<p>Anyway, I should be getting back to normal service soon, I hope (starting tomorrow, with any luck).</p>
