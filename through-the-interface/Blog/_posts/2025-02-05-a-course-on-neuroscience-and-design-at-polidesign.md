<p>I’m really excited to be starting a class later this month on <a href="https://www.polidesign.net/en/formazione/interior-design-and-architecture/corso--neuroscience-and-design/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Neuroscience and Design</a> from <a href="https://www.polidesign.net/en/about/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">POLI.design</a> - the post-graduate school of design at the Politecnico di Milano.</p>

<p>Most of the class is virtual - and in English, thankfully - but it’s book-ended by in-person seminars, first in Milan and then in Venice for the opening of <a href="https://www.labiennale.org/en" rel="noopener" target="_blank">this year’s biennale</a>. I’ve never been to the biennale, so this is exciting in itself!</p>
<p>Here’s a description from the website:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nowadays, the design of artificial spaces and industrial artifacts requires the integration of technical expertise with knowledge from <strong>social sciences</strong>, <strong>physiology</strong>, <strong>psychology</strong>, and <strong>neuroscience</strong>. The Executive Course in Neuroscience and Design is built upon this interdisciplinary dialogue. The program explores methodologies for analyzing human activities, considering them as a starting point for design. The key objectives of the course include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Integrating the technical skills of the designer with the foundations of neuroscience, physiology, and psychology</li>
<li>Deepening the understanding of perceptual mechanisms</li>
<li>Learning to apply insights into human behavior in the design process of space and objects</li>
<li>Acquiring multidisciplinary knowledge for enhancing the spatial experience in order to develop crucial skills for working in cutting-edge design firms</li>
</ul>
<p>The Executive Course is 60 hours long and exclusively held in English and remotely, except for the opening day, scheduled in Milan (February 21st), and the final lesson in Venice at the Biennale Architettura opening day (May 10). The educational proposal comprises theoretical lectures, seminars, and practical exercises exploring the following themes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Introduction to the physiology of perception in relation to spaces</li>
<li>Design and mental health</li>
<li>Designing environments and objects in harmony with the human being</li>
</ul>

<p>The “<a href="https://www.polidesign.net/en/formazione/interior-design-and-architecture/corso--neuroscience-and-design/#tab_didattica" rel="noopener" target="_blank">didactics</a>” section includes further details:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The 60-hour course unfolds over three months, featuring a five-hour lesson each week held remotely on Friday afternoons. The language of instruction is English. The three training modules provide knowledge concerning the physiology of the human body and the intricacies of perceptual mechanisms. Moreover, they facilitate the application of this knowledge in the design process.</p>
<p>Module 1 | Hours: 20</p>
<p><strong>Physiology of Perception</strong></p>
<p>An introduction to the relationship between the body and neuronal activity, studying how spatial characteristics influence human behavior, focusing on memory and emotions. An in-person seminar in Milan (at POLI.design) starts the educational journey with faculty and other special guests.</p>
<p><em>Focus</em>: the link between neuroscience and design (a class at the Venice Biennale); the body and brain dualism; how spatial features affect behavior; the relation between memory and emotions.</p>
<p>Module 2 | Hours: 20</p>
<p><strong>Design and Mental Health</strong></p>
<p>Focus on perception in architecture and urban space, the integration of the theory of emotion with the theory of mind models, and the impact of these processes on human health.</p>
<p><em>Focus</em>: the “4E” (Embodied, Extended, Enacted, Embedded) approach to perceptions; the cycle of perception; integrating scales of perception; affordances and atmospheres</p>
<p>Module 3 | Hours: 20</p>
<p><strong>Designing the Attunement</strong></p>
<p>Knowledge from previous modules is applied in the industrial and interior design phase. Case studies on well-being, workplaces, and learning environments are evaluated.</p>
<p>The Course will conclude its path with an in-person seminar at the Venice Biennale opening day, explicitly focusing on some works from the Master in Neuroscience Applied to Architecture and Design, and through a conclusive debate.</p>
<p><em>Focus</em>: neuroscience as starting point for Industrial Design and Interior Design projects; case studies on healthcare, workplace, learning environment projects; final seminar.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Aside from the content being really well aligned with our research interests, I’m also very much looking forward to connecting with other AEC professionals who have a common interest in the way the design of the built environment can influence behaviour and well-being. My team has already connected with a number of <a href="https://www.polidesign.net/en/formazione/interior-design-and-architecture/corso--neuroscience-and-design/#tab_faculty" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the faculty delivering the class</a>, which is a strong indication that this is going to be a great experience.</p>
<p>There’s only a couple of weeks before the kick-off seminar in Milan, but that’s still just about enough time to sign up!</p>
