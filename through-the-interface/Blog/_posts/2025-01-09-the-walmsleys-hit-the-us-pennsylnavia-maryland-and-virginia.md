<p>In <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2025/01/the-walmsleys-hit-the-us-washington-dc-and-delaware.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the last post</a> I shared some experiences from the first half of our two-week trip to the United States. Now we’ll look at the second half.</p>
<p>After leaving Bethany Beach we headed northwards along the coast, stopping at a few outlets along the way. Shopping in Delaware is presumably a thing because of the lack of sales tax.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_351477.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Outlets" src="/assets/image_351477.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>I will say that from this trip - and my son’s stay in US generally - it’s obvious that prices have gone up a huge amount over the last few years. Switzerland used to feel really expensive when compared with the US, but it’s far from being the case now. So we shopped, but not until we dropped. Or maybe we just dropped sooner.</p>
<p>We crossed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senator_William_V._Roth_Jr._Bridge" target="_blank" rel="noopener">another bridge</a> at St Georges…</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_599778.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Crossing the Roth Bridge" src="/assets/image_599778.jpg" alt="Crossing the Roth Bridge." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>… before stopping in Wilmington to refuel both the car and the kids: it was our last chance before leaving Delaware for Pennsylvania, and I’d been careful to check average gas prices per state: for our trip it made sense to fill the car in Delaware and Virginia (before returning it full to the rental company) rather than Pennsylvania and Maryland (which cost &gt;10% more). Petrol is still cheap in most of the US compared with Europe, so this optimization probably wasn’t worth the effort I put into it, but hey. :-)</p>
<p>Our destination in Pennsylvania was New Holland, Lancaster County, in Amish country. I’d stumbled on this possibility while researching places to stay that weren’t too far from Connecticut: Duncan, an old friend of mine from University, lives with his family in East Hartford and we wanted to find a place we could all drive to.</p>
<p>I'd excluded NYC quite quickly: because of the <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/airbnb-ban-new-york-city/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Airbnb ban there</a> or perhaps just the seasonal demand, the listings were either a) really expensive or b) really crappy or c) both. So we quickly shifted our attention to Philadelphia and its surroundings, which led me to Lancaster County, where we found a nice house that could accommodate the ten of us. The fact it was listed as being “in the heart of Amish country" just made it more appealing.<a href="/assets/image_61249.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Our home in New Holland" src="/assets/image_61249.jpg" alt="Our home in New Holland." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>It was lovely seeing Duncan again, as ever. We met during our first week at University and have stayed firm friends ever since.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_705461.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Duncan and Kean" src="/assets/image_705461.jpg" alt="Duncan and Kean." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Prior to this trip I’d learned everything I knew about the Amish from the 1985 film <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witness_(1985_film)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Witness</a> with Harrison Ford. Which by the way we watched with the kids which still in Delaware… you know, for research. It’s still a great movie.</p>
<p>During the few days we were in New Holland we had minimal actual contact with Amish people - we weren’t about to go and acost anyone - but we did buy some Amish produce at the Lancaster Central Market...</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_819667.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Lancaster Central Market" src="/assets/image_819667.jpg" alt="Lancaster Central Market." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>… as well as at the <a href="https://www.stoltzfusmeats.com/pages/stoltzfus-meats-and-deli-of-intercourse-pa" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stoltzfus Deli</a> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intercourse,_Pennsylvania" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Intercourse</a>. Yes, there’s a town called Intercourse. I’m very happy some enterprising person in that town realised the value of this as a brand.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_134388.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="I &lt;3 Intercourse" src="/assets/image_134388.jpg" alt="I &lt;3 Intercourse." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>We also went and visited the <a href="https://www.amishfarmandhouse.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amish Farm and House</a> in Lancaster, which is dedicated to educating the curious about Amish ways.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_656970.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Amish Farm and House" src="/assets/image_656970.jpg" alt="Amish Farm and House." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a>While I the region I took the opportunity to read up on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amish" target="_blank" rel="noopener">history of the Amish</a> and the various levels of practice. While I can’t claim to be any kind of expert, the feeling I got about their approach to life is generally positive: I can see they value community and family above personal vanity, something that’s all too relevant in these days of social media and the narcissism it both drives and feeds.</p>
<p>The Amish migrated to Pennsylvania from Alsace and Switzerland in the 18th and 19th centuries, and I definitely feel a resonance with the Swiss attitudes of today: the Swiss don’t like excessive ostentation (showing off status or wealth), for instance. I know this is a long way from not having shirts with buttons, but there's a familiarity to it, somehow.</p>
<p>Birthrates in developed countries have plummeted in recent decades, so the fact the Amish are growing - and creating new communities every day - is actually reassuring to me. It’s another path for humanity to flourish.</p>
<p>Given the risks of technological evolution - especially in the context of AI - I also love the fact that a community such as the Amish, with their relatively rudimentary technological needs, exists. Should a global catastrophe impact humanity - rendering the majority of the population useless, given our dependence on technology resulting from a highly optimized global supply chain - then the Amish would be there to lead us back on track. I hope it never happens, but still.</p>
<p>I just loved seeing horse-drawn buggies wherever we went in the area.<a href="/assets/image_513877.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Buggy while driving" src="/assets/image_513877.jpg" alt="Buggy while driving." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>I did my best to take photos discreetly - I’m not sure how well I managed.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_242194.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="One more buggy" src="/assets/image_242194.jpg" alt="One more buggy." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>The horses were so well trained: they coped with sharing the road with 18-wheelers… really quite impressive.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_867752.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Another buggy" src="/assets/image_867752.jpg" alt="Another buggy." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>I was actually surprised at how standardised the buggies - at least the ones in Lancaster County - seemed to be. They all had warning triangles at the back and dynamo-powered turn signals/indicators.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_557773.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="And another" src="/assets/image_557773.jpg" alt="And another." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>We even passed what I assume was a buggy dealership.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_457082.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="A local dealership" src="/assets/image_457082.jpg" alt="A local dealership." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>There were a few different configurations on the road. This one was open to the elements, for instance.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_72031.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="A cabriolet" src="/assets/image_72031.jpg" alt="A cabriolet." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>We also saw lots of people walking and using scooters.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_116910.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="A scooter" src="/assets/image_116910.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Aside from learning about the Amish, we enjoyed a nice hike up to the <a href="https://co.lancaster.pa.us/288/Money-Rocks-County-Park" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Money Rocks</a>. A strange name for a natural feature in Amish country, but hey. </p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_92978.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Money Rocks" src="/assets/image_92978.jpg" alt="Money Rocks." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>We also had a lovely pub lunch in the delightful town of Lititz.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_9366.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Pub lunch in Lititz" src="/assets/image_9366.jpg" alt="Pub lunch in Lititz." width="375" height="500" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>We were sad to leave the region. As we drove back south to Maryland, we tried to see how often we came across Amish farms. The best indicator we found was a full clothesline - it was clearly an ideal day to do laundry, as it was sunny and windy - and it seemed like quite an obvious sign that the farm was run by an Amish family.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_638309.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Clothesline" src="/assets/image_638309.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>We saw many such farms right to the Pennsylvania border - around the township called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Britain_Township,_Pennsylvania" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Little Britain</a> - and while it seems there are a small number of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amish_in_Maryland" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amish in Maryland</a>, we didn’t see any after we’d entered the state.<a href="/assets/image_696453.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Another clothesline" src="/assets/image_696453.jpg" alt="Another clothesline." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Our last Airbnb on this trip was in Port Deposit, a historic town on the Susquehanna River that's 15 minutes from the Pennsylvania border and an hour or so north of Baltimore.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_402685.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="View from our place in Port Deposit" src="/assets/image_402685.jpg" alt="View from our place in Port Deposit." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>We arrived here on December 30th, and had already planned on celebrating New Year’s Eve with dinner at the <a href="https://www.backfinbluesgroup.com/backfinblues" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Backfin Blues Bar &amp; Grill</a> and drinks afterwards at the <a href="https://graniteruntap.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Granite Run Taproom</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_316788.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="The local taproom" src="/assets/image_316788.jpg" alt="The local taproom." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>It was a really peaceful place…</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_842092.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="The Susquehanna River" src="/assets/image_842092.jpg" alt="The Susquehanna River." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>… other than when the cargo trains pass through, complying with the federal regulation to <a href="https://railroads.dot.gov/railroad-safety/divisions/highway-rail-crossing-and-trespasser-programs/train-horn-rulequiet-zones" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sound their horns whenever they’re about to go through a crossing</a>. Even in towns. And even in the middle of the night.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tHg9oJAua8g?si=B0YzNmMpJjAAJwd8" width="500" height="283" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p> </p>
<p>I’m not complaining, though: it was very clear from the Airbnb listing that these cargo trains would pass through - and regularly during the night - so I had advance notice. I just didn’t know how it would affect the various members of the family. Ear plugs were provided by our gracious host, but in the end no-one used them and everyone slept very well. I woke up for each train during the first night, but actually found it quite charming. And I didn’t hear them at all during the next two nights.</p>
<p>The weather had been very decent throughout our trip, but on New Year’s Eve it poured with rain. Luckily we weren’t far from the restaurant we’d booked - and it only rained through the meal - so it really didn’t affect things.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_849474.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="NYE dinner at the Backfin Blues" src="/assets/image_849474.jpg" alt="NYE dinner at the Backfin Blues." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>And dinner was surprisingly delicious. We each had something different and everyone loved their meal.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_817281.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="The dinner itself" src="/assets/image_817281.jpg" alt="The dinner itself." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Another memorable meal was as we passed through Havre de Grace, where we decided to stop to have hibachi. This was really a lot of fun.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_974423.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Hibachi in Havre de Grace" src="/assets/image_974423.jpg" alt="Hibachi in Havre de Grace." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Afterwards we stopped by the Conowingo Dam and enjoyed the view of the gulls feeding.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_973710.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Dam.gif" src="/assets/image_973710.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="281" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Another time we passed by someone was fishing there.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_360614.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Fishing by the dam" src="/assets/image_360614.jpg" alt="Fishing by the dam." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>There was a large number of bald eagles flying overhead whenever we came by. My best attempt at photographing them with my phone was at 30X, and they're barely recognisable. People with proper equipment were trying hard to capture clearer photos of them, of course.<a href="/assets/image_528836.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Bald eagles" src="/assets/image_528836.jpg" alt="Bald eagles." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>This location was also a favourite spot of another type of carnivorous bird.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_810725.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Warning" src="/assets/image_810725.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>To see so many vultures sitting in the nearby trees was beyond creepy. I wonder if Alfred Hitchcock ever came through here?</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_41798.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Vultures" src="/assets/image_41798.jpg" alt="" width="375" height="500" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Here’s a view from the top of the dam.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_729693.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="The Conowingo Dam" src="/assets/image_729693.jpg" alt="The Conowingo Dam." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>We also stopped on the Port Deposit side - ostensibly to see if we could get closer to the bald eagles - and found it very peaceful.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_171701.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Down by the river" src="/assets/image_171701.jpg" alt="Down by the river." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>On January 2nd we made our way southwards, once again. Our eldest wanted to show his siblings where he was lodging in Baltimore, and we stopped there briefly before heading out to breakfast.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_283171.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Not bad student digs" src="/assets/image_283171.jpg" alt="Not bad student digs." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Baltimore can be a bit sketchy.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_106590.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Going for breakfast in Baltimore" src="/assets/image_106590.jpg" alt="Going for breakfast in Baltimore." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>But Pete’s Grill is a great place to get breakfast that’s a short walk from our son’s digs.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_824940.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Breakfast at Pete's Grill" src="/assets/image_824940.jpg" alt="Breakfast at Pete's Grill." width="375" height="500" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Once properly fuelled we header across to the Johns Hopkins Homewood campus.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_536027.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="JHU" src="/assets/image_536027.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>

<p>We also spent some time visiting the <a href="https://artbma.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Baltimore Museum of Art</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_636209.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Baltimore Museum of Art" src="/assets/image_636209.jpg" alt="Baltimore Museum of Art." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>After this we headed towards DC. We’d booked a surprisingly comfortable (and affordable) studio in the SpringHill Suites at Fairfax.</p>
<p>Our flight home was only at 5:30pm on the 3rd, so the plan was to stay near the airport and visit one last Smithsonian location before dropping the rental car and flying out.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_123381.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="SpringHill Suites Fairfax" src="/assets/image_123381.jpg" alt="SpringHill Suites Fairfax." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>So it was that on the morning of January 3rd, we found ourselves at the <a href="https://airandspace.si.edu/visit/udvar-hazy-center" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center of the National Air &amp; Space Museum</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_465197.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Another Air and Space visit" src="/assets/image_465197.jpg" alt="Another Air and Space visit." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>This place is bonkers. The site as you arrive is of an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_SR-71_Blackbird" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SR-71 Blackbird</a> - the fastest manned aircraft ever flown - and the Space Shuttle Discovery.<a href="/assets/image_355867.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Wow" src="/assets/image_355867.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Being a child of the 80s (yes, I know, born in the 70s ;-), this was a dream come true.</p>

<p>We joined a tour that went through the whole center, but a lot of time was spent in the Space Hangar, as you’d expect.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_228391.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="The tour" src="/assets/image_228391.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a>It was so amazing to see it from right beneath it.</p>

<p>It was clearly very sobering to see, however impressive.<a href="/assets/image_472599.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="From above" src="/assets/image_472599.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a>Many other WWII planes were on display, of course, including several with <em>that</em> symbol.</p>

<p>And in many ways the “pièce de résistance” was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concorde" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Concorde</a>. As it’s French and all that.</p>

<p>By the time we left and dropped our car back it had started to snow. Presumably the beginning of the <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/weather/winter-weather/much-us-bracing-big-blast-winter-serious-cold-rcna185950" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cold front hitting the US right now</a>.</p>

<p>I’d love to say the return flight was uneventful, and in many ways it was once it actually took off. There was just the small matter of a mechanical problem forcing us to wait for an alternate plane to be taken out of the hangar and prepared for flight. We ended up leaving 4 hours late.</p>

<p>Eventually we made it home, where our kids could meet their friends and we could relax after a fun-packed fortnight. It really was a brilliant holiday, and I’m very glad everything basically went to plan. Now it’s time to get back to work!</p>
