<p>While not necessarily relevant when working with AutoCAD data, it’s very common for people to want to make use of adjacent database systems when developing AutoCAD applications.</p>
<p>For just this reason I’ve been meaning to post something on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_Integrated_Query">LINQ</a> (and, in due course, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_Extensions">PLINQ</a>), but for now I recommend checking out <a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2009/07/language-integrated-query-linq.html">this guest post from Joel Karr</a> over on Jeremy Tammik’s <a href="http://blogs.autodesk.com/thebuildingcoder">The Building Coder</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks for the tip, Jeremy! :-)</p>
