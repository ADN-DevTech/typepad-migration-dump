<p>Last year we held <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2007/07/coming-in-septe.html">our first DevCamps</a> for AEC and Manufacturing customers &amp; partners. Following on from their success, this year's events are fast approaching: this year we've added Geospatial into the mix, and are holding DevCamps through the month of June.</p><blockquote dir="ltr"><p><strong>Manufacturing DevCamp</strong><br />June 11-13, 2008<br />Portland, Oregon</p>

<p><strong>Architecture, Engineering &amp; Construction DevCamp</strong><br />June 16-18, 2008<br />Wakefield, Massachusetts (near Boston)</p>

<p><strong>Geospatial DevCamp</strong><br />June 25-27, 2008<br />San Rafael, California (near San Francisco)</p></blockquote><p>This is really a good opportunity to meet and get to know members of my team (DevTech) and Autodesk's engineering teams, as well as getting first-rate information on how to develop with Autodesk APIs.</p>
