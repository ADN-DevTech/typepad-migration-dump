<p>I&#39;m currently in Boston for an internal technical summit where I&#39;ll be presenting sessions on Kinect Fusion and Leap Motion (which will the sessions I&#39;ve submitted - and will hopefully get accepted - for AU 2013). I arrived a day early and rented a bicycle from the hotel, taking the opportunity to cycle through the MIT and Harvard campuses (both of which are in Cambridge, where the summit is taking place) and then on to downtown Boston. It was really great being back in Boston after probably five years - it&#39;s still one of my favourite cities in the US.</p>
<p>I received this through the post, last week. A $5 bill from <a href="http://www.fauxpausnotes.com" target="_blank">Doug Bell</a>. It was designed for the recent American Numismatic Association’s <a href="http://nationalmoneyshow.com" target="_blank">National Money Show</a> in New Orleans. Doug used <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2013/04/printing-your-own-money-with-autocad.html" target="_blank">the application</a> <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2013/04/show-me-the-money.html" target="_blank">I developed</a> for him in conjunction with AutoCAD to design the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guilloch%C3%A9" target="_blank">guilloché</a> pattern in the note’s background:</p>
<p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20192aa43e0f3970d-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="AutoCAD-designed money" border="0" height="222" src="/assets/image_144789.jpg" style="background-image: none; margin: 20px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" title="AutoCAD-designed money" width="454" /></a></p>
<p>For the next event it seems Doug’s planning not only to design his notes using AutoCAD, but to use it to plot the pattern more directly onto the notes themselves. I look forward to seeing the results!</p>
