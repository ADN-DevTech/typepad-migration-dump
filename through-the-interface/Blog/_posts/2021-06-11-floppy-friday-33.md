<p><a href="https://youtu.be/qgIFlxOKb8Q" rel="noopener" target="_blank">This week’s episode</a> looks at three games I’d checked out briefly yesterday, as I’d been getting a little fed-up with editing out games that didn’t load. As it was I had to load the first game – <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Ninja" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Last Ninja</a> – three times before it worked properly (I did edit that bit out). After that we played <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Die_Hard_%28video_game%29" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Die Hard</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gee_Bee_Air_Rally" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Gee Bee Air Rally</a>.</p>

<p>All this week’s games were fun to play: The Last Ninja is considered a real classic, it seems, and while Die Hard starts slow, it apparently gets more interesting later on. Here are the Zzap!64 reviews for these <a href="http://www.zzap64.co.uk/cgi-bin/displaypage.pl?issue=028&amp;page=104&amp;thumbstart=0&amp;magazine=zzap" rel="noopener" target="_blank">two</a> <a href="http://www.zzap64.co.uk/cgi-bin/displaypage.pl?issue=063&amp;page=009&amp;thumbstart=1&amp;magazine=zzap" rel="noopener" target="_blank">games</a>:</p>

<p>I couldn’t find a review for Gee Bee Air Rally, so here’s its cover art:</p>
