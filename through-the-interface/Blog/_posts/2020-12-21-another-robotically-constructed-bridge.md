<p>This week Autodesk offices around the world are closed for an extended holiday break. I’m grateful for this additional time off at the end of a crazy year, as I’m sure all my Autodesk colleagues are.</p><p>My children are still in school until Wednesday lunchtime, so I’ve taken the chance to hit the slopes for a few days before heading back down for a quiet family Christmas. (We’ll be back up in the mountains afterwards, assuming we’re still able to ski then.)</p><p>As I’m largely at a loose end in the evening after coming back from the slopes, I did have a couple of quick posts to share before starting my break properly. Oh, and I’ve recorded some advance <a href="https://keanw.com/retro-computing">Floppy Fridays</a> to go out over the break, so those will continue throughout.</p><p>The first post is about another robotically-constructed bridge project (meaning other than the <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2018/04/checking-out-the-worlds-first-3d-printed-steel-bridge-at-mx3d-in-amsterdam.html">MX3D bridge</a>, which I’m closer to) that colleagues from the Autodesk Research Robotics Lab have engaged in – you may have seen <a href="https://redshift.autodesk.com/collaborative-robotics/">the article on Redshift</a>.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2026be42ec936200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="278" title="The Arroyo Bridge" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="The Arroyo Bridge" src="/assets/image_756937.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>In any case, here’s a <a href="https://youtu.be/zMXVOZec2Xw">YouTube version</a> of the project video:</p><p align="center"><br></p><p align="center"><iframe width="500" height="283" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zMXVOZec2Xw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"></iframe></p><p><br></p><p>It’s an interesting project, with more of a focus on collaboration between robots and humans, with robots performing the more mundane activities and master welders working on the higher-value tasks.</p>
