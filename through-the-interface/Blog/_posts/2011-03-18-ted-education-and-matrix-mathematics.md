<p>I talked <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2011/03/instant-3d-model-capture.html" target="_blank">briefly about TED</a>, a few weeks ago. A number of Autodesk employees attend this event, including members of our senior staff. During a recent All Hands session, <a href="http://autodesk.com/pr-amarhanspal" target="_blank">Amar Hanspal</a> – who heads up our Platforms Solutions and Emerging Business division, which includes both Autodesk Labs and AutoCAD Engineering (among other teams) – reported on his experience at <a href="http://conferences.ted.com/TED2011/program/" target="_blank">TED 2011</a>, and talked about a couple of extremely inspiring presentations.</p>  <p><a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/salman_khan_let_s_use_video_to_reinvent_education.html" target="_blank">One of them</a>, by Salman Khan, discussed <a href="http://www.khanacademy.org/" target="_blank">a non-profit organisation</a> he had set up to help educate people on mathematics (and now other subjects). Thought-provoking stuff: it certainly has me thinking about how we structure our API training offerings as well as the way my children are likely to receive – and participate in – their education over the coming years.</p>  <p>Of much more direct relevance to this blog’s audience is the fact the Khan Academy contains some really good (and free) material on learning mathematics: a topic this blog has <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2010/12/enter-the-matrix.html" target="_blank">discussed</a> <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2010/12/a-simple-command-to-perform-a-matrix-transformation-on-an-autocad-entity-using-net.html" target="_blank">before</a> in relation to matrix transformations.</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2014e86c764d5970d-pi"><img alt="Khan Academy - Linear Transformations as Matrix Vector Products" border="0" height="319" src="/assets/image_568512.jpg" style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; margin: 20px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="Khan Academy - Linear Transformations as Matrix Vector Products" width="447" /></a></p>  <p>There is an incredible wealth of material available on the site: I expect readers will be interested in topics such as <a href="http://www.khanacademy.org/#Algebra" target="_blank">algebra</a>, <a href="http://www.khanacademy.org/#Geometry" target="_blank">geometry</a>, <a href="http://www.khanacademy.org/#Trigonometry" target="_blank">trigonometry</a> and <a href="http://www.khanacademy.org/#Linear Algebra" target="_blank">linear algebra</a>, but it doesn’t stop there, by any means (I may just dip into the <a href="http://www.khanacademy.org/#Cosmology and Astronomy" target="_blank">cosmology and astronomy</a> material, if I ever get the time). Take a look and see what you think.</p>
