<p>It’s been an interesting first week in <a href="http://autodeskresearch.com" target="_blank">Autodesk Research</a>. I’ve had the opportunity to jump into a few projects that are really interesting. One involves the use of generative design tools to perform a number of different analyses on design alternatives for an architectural project, assessing criteria such as maximum team co-location and improving the circulation of people through corridors.</p> <p>One the tools being used for the analysis is Dynamo: something I’ve been meaning to spend some time with for ages, but finally have good reason to. (Some of you may remember my involvement/interest in the <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/designscript/" target="_blank">DesignScript</a> project… DesignScript is the language engine that drives Dynamo, so many of the concepts are very familiar. It’s a bit like meeting an old friend after a long separation. :-)</p> <p>The hope is to use Dynamo to perform – among other things – spatial analysis using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isovist" target="_blank">isovists</a>, a term I was previously unfamiliar with. Isovists basically allow you to analyse the space enclosing a given point in the model: it’s like tracking light outwards from a point light source and detecting the illuminated volume.</p> <p>I couldn’t find a direct way to generate isovists in Dynamo, but I did stumble across a (somewhat) recent Hackathon project called <a href="http://dynamobim.com/acoustamo" target="_blank">Acoustamo</a> (which I’ve also seen referred to as <a href="https://andreaarch.wordpress.com/2015/01/31/acustamo-designed-by-the-sound-au-dynamo-hackathon-competition-1st-place/" target="_blank">Acustamo</a>). This is a simple tool to perform acoustic analysis of a space: it uses rudimentary raytracing to analyse the reflection of sound, allowing you to analyse acoustic properties during conceptual design. I figured that isovist analysis is basically raytracing without the bounce (you limit the rays from being reflected at all: they simply get absorbed by the first obstacles they hit), so it seemed like an easy way to try it out.</p> <p>I installed the “Acustamo” package inside Dynamo Studio and hacked around with <a href="http://www.av-archtech.com/tools/Acustamo/Tutorial-1.zip" target="_blank">the provided tutorial</a>. Rather than taking geometry from Revit – as I’m not currently working inside Revit, but running standalone – I created a circular space and ran the analysis from a point located inside it. Nothing spectacular, but it appears to show that the principle works well enough. <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/files/Ray%20trace%20test.dyn" target="_blank">Here’s my Dynamo file</a> – you’ll need to install the Acustamo package manually, as the .dyn format doesn’t appear to contain package references, at least none that Dynamo Studio acts upon – in order to try it for yourself.</p> <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b7c81486d9970b-pi" target="_blank"><img title="Isovist in Dynamo" style="float: none; margin: 30px auto; display: block" alt="Isovist in Dynamo" src="/assets/image_486965.jpg" width="500" height="275"></a></p> <p>In many ways what we’re doing is similar to the concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_application" target="_blank">partial application</a> in functional programming: we’re effectively “fixing” the maxBounces parameter of the Raytrace function to 0.</p> <p>I’d like to see how I can compose this into a nicely packaged node… I know I can create a <a href="https://github.com/DynamoDS/Dynamo/wiki/Zero-Touch-Plugin-Development" target="_blank">zero-touch .NET plugin</a> – much in the same way as Acustamo was implemented – but I’m curious whether it’s possible to build higher-level components based on existing ones. It seems to me that this kind of encapsulation would be necessary for a system like Dynamo – where you can quickly get huge graphs without it – so hopefully it’s just a matter of learning how it all works.</p>
