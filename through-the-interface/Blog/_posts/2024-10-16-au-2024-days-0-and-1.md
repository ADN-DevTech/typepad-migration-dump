<p>On Sunday morning I headed across to Geneva Airport for my trip to Autodesk University 2024 in San Diego.The trip itself didn’t start very smoothly: I couldn't check in online - I suspect having two passports, only one of which has a valid US ESTA - meant that the airline flagged me for manual review. I really need to be more careful with my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance_Passenger_Information_System" rel="noopener" target="_blank">API</a> (not the one I work with usually ;-) in future.<a href="/assets/image_417709.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Leaving Geneva." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_417709.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Leaving Geneva" width="500" /></a>Anyway, this check-in fail led to a cascade of irritations, from having to pay for a seat (to avoid being assigned a middle seat on a long-haul flight) to going earlier to the airport than I would have otherwise (and buying a new train ticket, as the advance one I’d bought wasn’t valid on the earlier train) and then having to check my carry-on (I was in boarding group 9 for my first flight - I’d snagged a seat near the front - so the check-in person absolutely insisted he couldn’t let me take my case on the plane). With a delay on the flight out of GVA I was paranoid about being stuck without my luggage in San Diego.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_408491.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_408491.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Gate C55" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>The flights themselves were comfortable enough.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_52900.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_52900.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="The plane" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>The connections was super-tight in Heathrow - despite not having to change terminals - but I made it, just. And my seat on the second flight was in the last row of the cabin, so I could stay reclined with zero guilt.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_542677.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Arriving in San Diego." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_542677.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Arriving in San Diego" width="500" /></a>It was early evening in San Diego when we arrived, and the light was lovely.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_999578.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="At the gate in SD." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_999578.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="At the gate in SD" width="500" /></a>My suitcase was one of the first ones out (presumably hold luggage works on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type)" rel="noopener" target="_blank">LIFO</a> system), which was a huge relief.</p>
<p>We then took a Lyft to the Marriott, snapping a couple of photos of the ocean front, along the way.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_934234.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="The seafront in San Diego." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_934234.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="The seafront in San Diego" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>After a quick dinner I had a very decent first night’s sleep before the Dynamo Day Hackathon on the day before AU itself (let’s call it Day 0).</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_675768.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Welcome to AU 2024." border="0" height="500" src="/assets/image_675768.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Welcome to AU 2024" width="375" /></a></p>
<p>The Marriott Marquis is right next to the San Diego Convention Center, where this year’s AU is being held. The Dynamo Day Hackathon was held in the other hotel near the Center, the Hilton Bayside.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_15926.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="The Convention Center." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_15926.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="The Convention Center" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>The Dynamo team had some temporary tattoos printed, that apparently work very well on shaved heads. (In fact they work almost too well - I’m started to wonder just how temporary they are, two days later.)</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_527759.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Dynamo Day Hackathon." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_527759.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Dynamo Day Hackathon" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>The Dynamo Product Management team introduced the day.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_983856.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" height="500" src="/assets/image_983856.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Introductions" width="375" /></a></p>
<p>Sol announced the Beta availability of Dynamo as a Service (DaaS), and the fact that VASA is one of the few packages currently available for it. This is something I’ll dig into in a future post - it effectively allows developers of Dynamo graphs to deploy them to their users without them having a working local Dynamo host… this is hugely valuable when working with browser-based Dynamo clients such as Forma. Really, really cool!</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_208517.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="VASA in DaaS." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_208517.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="VASA in DaaS" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>I think Sol secretly wants to get a sleeve tattoo. It would look good on him!</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_957630.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Sol's Dynasleeve." border="0" height="500" src="/assets/image_957630.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Sol's Dynasleeve" width="375" /></a></p>
<p>The energy in the room was fantastic. I was mainly there to support teams choosing to use VASA - of which there didn’t end up being any - but I did appreciate having the time to re-connect with people and get over my jet lag.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_231583.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Lots of hacking." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_231583.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Lots of hacking" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>At 3pm the shareouts started. I’ll share the photos I took of the (spoiler!) winning teams.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_181857.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="The shareout." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_181857.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="The shareout" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>The special mention for innovation went to the InFORMAnts, who created an LLM-driven prototype that iteratively generates Dynamo nodes to solve a problem expressed as a text prompt.<a href="/assets/image_78887.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="The InFORMAnts." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_78887.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="The InFORMAnts" width="500" /></a>The special mention for the most fun project went to Let’s Play a Dynamo Game, who created an awesome quiz to test Revit user’s product knowledge, with some nasty consequences if you got the question wrong. &nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_21443.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Let's Play a Dynamo Game." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_21443.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Let's Play a Dynamo Game" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>The third place team was ?ext:daas, who used Dynamo to move data between Civil 3D, Forma and Revit.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_466636.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_466636.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="ext..DaaS" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>The second place team was the Utah Teapot Programmers. They did something related to acoustic analysis (I think, anyway!).</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_758458.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Utah Teapot Programmers." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_758458.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Utah Teapot Programmers" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>The first place team was EcoMatic, who worked on the problem of sourcing imagery and materials for architectural projects.<a href="/assets/image_4835.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_4835.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="EcoMatic" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Here’s the announcement of the special mentions.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_495603.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Special mentions." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_495603.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Special mentions" width="500" /></a>And the winners.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_428350.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="The winners." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_428350.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="The winners" width="500" /></a>After the day was over, everyone went out to a nearby balcony space to catch up on exposure to fresh air and ultraviolet radiation.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_141865.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="View from the balcony." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_141865.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="View from the balcony" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>It was a super fun day. I really enjoyed catching up with members of this really vibrant community!<a href="/assets/image_793045.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Hanging out after the Hackathon." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_793045.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Hanging out after the Hackathon" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>After this was over we headed back to the Convention Center for the AU welcome event.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_210585.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_210585.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Going up" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>It was held in the Community Zone. One of the popular exhibits related to creating with LEGO bricks.<a href="/assets/image_178010.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" height="500" src="/assets/image_178010.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Lego" width="375" /></a></p>
<p>After this I headed to the Speaker Social event, where I ended up having some really interesting chats with fellow AU speakers. By this time I was getting really tired, so opted to head back and maximize sleep before presenting the following day.</p>
<p>In the morning I joined the General Session of AU Day 1.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_657194.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Waiting to start." border="0" height="500" src="/assets/image_657194.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Waiting to start" width="375" /></a>I’d been chatting outside with a member of our Sales team and a customer of his, and we somehow found ourselves in a queue to get into the General Session. It was quite surreal - one minute we were alone and the next minute there were people to our left and to our right. So we did the only sensible thing and followed the flow of people into the enormous mainstage space.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_54396.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="General Session Day 1." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_54396.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="General Session Day 1" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>It’s always nice to see my Research colleague and friend Pete Storey show up in the AU mainstage visuals.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_470320.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="My mate Pete." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_470320.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="My mate Pete" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>The Autodesk Research efforts around AI - especially Project Bernini - got a lot of airtime.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_343550.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Project Bernini." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_343550.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Project Bernini" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>I enjoy seeing images that refer back to our long history. Part of me wishes I didn’t recall so much of the stuff to the left of these image, though.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_912044.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_912044.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="History" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Leaving the General Session the event space suddenly seemed really full.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_793750.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Getting busy." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_793750.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Getting busy" width="500" /></a>The session area was really long. When I first went looking for the room we’d be using, it seemed to go on forever.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_309439.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="The classrooms." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_309439.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="The classrooms" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>I later realized there was a quicker way to get there - I’d just taken the wrong escalator.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_644139.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" height="500" src="/assets/image_644139.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Our room" width="375" /></a></p>
<p>The configuration of our room was interesting. In Vegas it feels as though this would have been a long, narrow room rather than a short, wide one. It wasn’t a bad layout, though!</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_899384.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_899384.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="The layout" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>I was really happy to be presenting with Håvard Høiby from the Forma team. He’s not only extremely talented and capable, he's also a thoroughly nice chap.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_849346.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Kean and Håvard." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_849346.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Kean and Håvard" width="500" /></a>Håvard did a lot of live-coding during his part of the session, which I always find a super-effective way to communicating the value (and above all simplicity) of an API or SDK.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_373293.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Getting started." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_373293.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Getting started" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>I found Håvard's segment really engaging.<a href="/assets/image_759771.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Forma extensions rule." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_759771.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Forma extensions rule" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>A nice surprise was catching up with Thilak Rao, one of the people I worked closely with after the ADN team recruited him and his colleagues in Bangalore. I’d seen Thilak enter the room, but hadn't immediately recognized him.<a href="/assets/image_623096.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Thilak and Kean." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_623096.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Thilak and Kean" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>The next session I attended was the APS mainstage.<a href="/assets/image_420814.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="APS mainstage." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_420814.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="APS mainstage" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>One of the key announcements was the date and location for next year's Autodesk DevCon: it'll be held in Amsterdam from May 20-21, 2025. The last time I attended an Autodesk Developer Conference in Amsterdam was just after I joined the company, back in 1995. I hope I get to attend this one, too!</p>
<p>If you’re interested in participating - and develop actively with APS - then be sure to <a href="https://aps.autodesk.com/autodesk-devcon-2025" rel="noopener" target="_blank">submit your class proposals</a>. These are being opened up to the broader community for the first time.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_45435.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Save the Date." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_45435.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Save the Date" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Another old friend is Fernando Malard. I was very happy to get to hang out with him for some time.<a href="/assets/image_207304.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Fernando and Kean." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_207304.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Fernando and Kean" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>We wandered around the Expo for some time.<a href="/assets/image_726224.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_726224.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="The Expo" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>It was great to see the Workshop XR booth getting a lot of attention. The tool has just been released, and we're hoping to use it to supercharge our human experience research efforts.<a href="/assets/image_733040.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Workshop XR booth." border="0" height="500" src="/assets/image_733040.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Workshop XR booth" width="375" /></a></p>
<p>The Autodesk AI booth was worth a visit, too.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_763357.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Autodesk AI booth." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_763357.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Autodesk AI booth" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>It was possible to take Project Bernini for a spin or simply check our some of its output in 3D-printed form.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_428774.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Bernini prints." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_428774.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Bernini prints" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>I also got to catch up with my friends from CCTech in Pune.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_129787.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="CCTech in the Expo." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_129787.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="CCTech in the Expo.jpeg" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>After this I headed with colleagues to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceanside,_California" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Oceanside</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_819688.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_819688.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Oceanside" width="500" /></a>It was really refreshing to hang out by the ocean for some time. A big change from Vegas!</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_391174.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_391174.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Surf's up" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>We stayed for a few local beers on a rooftop bar.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_529920.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Research folk in Oceanside." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_529920.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Research folk in Oceanside" width="500" /></a>Some of us headed briefly to a karaoke bar for one last drink - a lot of Autodeskers were singing, but I decided to head back to the hotel and prioritize sleep once again. By the time Thursday night’s party comes around I’ll be in great shape, no doubt!</p>
