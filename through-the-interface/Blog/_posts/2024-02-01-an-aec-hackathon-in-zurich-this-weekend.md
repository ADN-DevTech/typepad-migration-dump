<p>The awesome <a href="https://hackaec.com">AEC Hackathon</a> folks are running an <a href="https://hackaec.com/events.html">event</a> near Zurich <a href="https://www.opensource.construction/events/aec-hackathon">this weekend</a>, February 2-4, 2024.</p>
<p>This Hackathon will actually be at the <a href="https://www.zhaw.ch/en/university/">ZHAW</a> campus in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winterthur">Winterthur</a> - which is actually a completely different Swiss city that’s admittedly only 20 minutes away from Zurich by train. So the branding isn’t completely off, in a global sense. :-)</p>
<p>We’re in the middle of the snowy season, here in Switzerland, so I’m “committed” to being on the slopes with my family. While I won’t be there for the weekend itself, I will be stopping by Winterthur for the Friday afternoon talks on open source and then the Friday evening team formation. I wish I could stay longer, but that’s how it is.</p>
<p>It’s been a while since I was an an AEC Hackathon. Thanks to Google Photos I realized that I attended the events in Munich in 2017...</p>

<p>… and Berlin in 2018:</p>

<p>So it’s been a while. I’m looking forward to catching up with some old friends, while I’m there!</p>
