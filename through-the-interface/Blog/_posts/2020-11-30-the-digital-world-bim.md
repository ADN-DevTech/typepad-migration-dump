Here’s the agenda for Day 1 (<strong>December 1st 2020</strong>, all times UTC/GMT):</p><blockquote><p>09:00 - 09:10 Chairman's Opening Remarks<p>09:10 - 10:30 DFMA and IoT: What are the possibilities?<p>10:30 - 10:50 Morning Break<p>10:50 - 12:00 Build-by-wire: the future<p>12:00 - 13:00 Asset Performance Management: Who benefits? What could we expect?<p>13:00 - 13:30 Lunch Break<p><em>[13:30 - 15:45 Product Data and Standardization]</em><p>13:30 - 13:50 Construction Innovation Hub and LEXiCON<p>13:50 - 14:10 Manufacturer’s Product Data: A Plain language Guide<p>14:10 - 14:30 CEN and ISO activity around product data <p>14:30 - 14:45 Afternoon break<p>14:45 - 15:05 Overview of PAS 14191<p>15:05 - 15:25 Product Data Standards in Use<p>15:25 - 15:45 Q&amp;A Panel<p>15:45 - 16:30 The globalization of BIM and its application to digital twin technology<p>16:30 - 16:45 Talent Management and career development in BIM<p>16:45 - 17:00 Closing remarks and end of the event</p></blockquote><p>I’ll be presenting as part of the 10:50am session entitled <strong>“Build-by-wire: the future”. </strong>The overall agenda looks really compelling, though, so even if you can’t make that segment it seems as though there’s a lot of great content at other times in the day.<p>Apparently there are upwards of 500 people registered for the event (not necessarily for the 10:50am slot, of course), so it sounds like it could also have a lot of audience engagement.<p>At the time of writing it’s still possible to <a href="https://www.bsigroup.com/en-GB/our-services/events/webinars/2020/built-environment-summit/the-digital-world-bim/" target="_blank">register via this link</a> (from where you can also get the full agenda including the names of the presenters). You can register for <a href="https://www.bsigroup.com/en-GB/our-services/events/webinars/2020/built-environment-summit/global-built-environment-congress/" target="_blank">Day 2 – The Global Built Environment Congress</a> and <a href="https://www.bsigroup.com/en-GB/our-services/events/webinars/2020/built-environment-summit/fire-and-built-environment/" target="_blank">Day 3 – Fire and the Built Environment</a>, too, if those days seem of interest to you. Note that you will need to register separately for each day you wish to attend. See you there!
