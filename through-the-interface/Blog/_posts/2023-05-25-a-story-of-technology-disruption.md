<p>This topic seems very timely, given the fact I&#39;ve now returned from a <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2023/05/techx-2023-in-dallas.html">conference focused on the evolution of technology within Autodesk</a>. And it&#39;s one that&#39;s been coming up a lot lately, at home, and I mean A LOT.</p>
<p>Since long before the industrial revolution (and I fully admit to not being a particularly avid historian), technology has displaced jobs. I suppose you could say that hunter-gatherers lost out to farmers and it&#39;s been downhill ever since.</p>
<p>Right now, though, the impact of this current wave of technology has made many people anxious. I have regular discussions with my kids about their career possibilities, and frankly I&#39;m feeling less and less able to give anything approaching coherent advice.</p>
<p>But first some history. My own father studied at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_College_of_Communication">London College of Printing</a>, although he left before graduating to travel abroad and help run a couple of factories in Africa and India for <a href="https://www.monotype.com/">Monotype</a> (who you may know for their typefaces but also built <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monotype_system">printing machines</a>, back in the day). After meeting – and eventually marrying – my mother in Bangalore, they ended up moving back to the UK and running a local printing shop (my grandfather&#39;s) in a small Norfolk market town. When that business failed, my father pivoted (although I&#39;m 100% certain he didn&#39;t use that term) to become a graphic designer. Small market towns need about as many graphic designers as they do printing shops, it turns out, and despite being hardworking and very talented – and attracting clients throughout East Anglia – the industry shifted away from boutique graphic designers as desktop publishing democratised the activity, at least for smaller projects.</p>
<p>So while I grew up very, very aware of the shifting sands of technology, my own choice to go &quot;into computers&quot; (&quot;oh, it&#39;s the future!&quot; I would hear regularly from people, reassuringly enough) seemed reasonable. I never worried for my own employability during my early career, I&#39;m happy to say.</p>
<p>And so here we are, when finally it seems a wave of technology disruption has come along that&#39;s enough of a paradigm shift that software developers are also being adversely impacted. I guess it was inevitable, and I&#39;m sure there are quite a few folks out there who would be thinking &quot;it&#39;s about time&quot; if they weren&#39;t too busy worrying about their own employability.</p>
<p>On the one hand, just like all other technologies, AI is &quot;just a tool&quot;. It&#39;s going to make those of us who are working much more efficient. The <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/03/16/introducing-microsoft-365-copilot-your-copilot-for-work/">Microsoft 365 Copilot</a> video made that much clear to me. Wow.</p>
<p>But there are lots of knowledge-worker jobs that this wave is going to displace. A friend of mine working in insurance spends his days comparing offers from insurers to pass onto his clients, for instance. A small part of his role is customer-facing – and that&#39;s going to stay, at least for a while – but a big chunk is drudging through these offers, all of which are formatted differently, to tease out the pros and cons. Stuff that LLMs will make easy work of, I expect. It&#39;s not about whether this job will still be around, but how many of his team of a dozen will be needed for the client-facing work once the research has been largely automated.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/LinusEkenstam/status/1616153258623369250?lang=en">One quote</a> I saw recently was interesting:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>AI will not replace humans, but humans with AI will replace humans without AI.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s a little bit twee, and perhaps needs some unpacking:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>AI will not replace humans, but a human with AI will replace </em><strong>n</strong><em> humans without AI.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m guessing that <strong>n</strong> might well be as many as 10, for some professions, and in many others it&#39;ll be at least 2.</p>
<p>So here I am having career discussions with my kids. Our eldest is at engineering school studying Life Sciences Engineering, which he loves. I&#39;m not especially worried about his employability, as he&#39;s already using AI to fold proteins as a first-year undergraduate. Welcome to the new world.</p>
<p>Our second is still at high school studying (primarily) physics and applied mathematics. Like many of his classmates he&#39;s asking himself lots of questions about his future. His passion to make music – which could well turn into his career, depending – is clearly threatened by generative AI.</p>
<p>Our third is in 10th grade (at least in the Swiss system – I think this equates to 8th grade in the US), and is still debating whether she wants to try to become a journalist, an actress or a singer. She sees AI threatening all these jobs, so is feeling largely rudderless. As a parent I&#39;ve always felt I could give reasonable advice on which careers are likely to be in demand and which simply aren&#39;t, but my ability to predict the future of work feels severely reduced, right now.</p>
<p>Overall I want to tell them not to worry especially about the future: the skills you acquire during your studies and as you start your career will be the foundation for whatever comes after. Be curious. Try to find something that you love doing and that affords you the opportunity to build expertise and competence, but predicting the future is hard, so try to develop resilience, too. And always try to keep learning new skills. I know this sounds a little strange coming from someone who’s been with the same company for nearly 3 decades, but I’ve worked in several different departments in wildly different roles, and have also moved around a lot over the years.</p>
<p>I like this Venn diagram, that talks about the Japanese concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikigai">ikigai</a>.</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202b751a5e4be200c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false"><img alt="Ikigai" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83452464869e202b751a5e4be200c img-responsive" src="/assets/image_983050.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; width: 500px; display: block;" title="Ikigai" /></a></p>
<p>The problem is that “what the world needs” and “what you can be paid for” will shift over time. You may find yourself drifting through different areas of this diagram, sometimes without even realising it. Right now I can’t say for sure whether I’m in the middle zone, although I do believe I’ve been lucky enough to have been near it for much of my career.</p>
<p>More than 50 years ago Alvin Tofler wrote in his seminal work, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_Shock">Future Shock</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The illiterate of the 21st century will not be those who cannot read and write, but those who cannot learn, unlearn, and relearn.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>These words are even more true than when they were first published in 1970. My kids are unlikely to be at the same company for as long as I have (I can’t believe it myself, most days), so they need to learn to roll with the punches and also to identify when it’s time to move on, whether to a new role or another company.</p>
