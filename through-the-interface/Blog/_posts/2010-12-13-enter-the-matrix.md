<p>One AU evening at the bar, I was chatting to a couple of developers who suggested covering some fundamental mathematics on this blog: their respective career paths had not involved any formal (or perhaps recent) studies of certain important areas of mathematics, especially related to core <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_algebra" target="_blank">linear algebra</a> concepts such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_multiplication" target="_blank">matrix multiplication</a>.</p>  <p>Part of me said, “what a great idea”, another part said “I wonder what resources are already out there” and the last said “oh man, I don’t remember how all that stuff actually works”. :-)</p>  <p>Before I start dusting off some of that well-buried geometrical knowledge, I thought I’d ask a couple of questions of this blog’s readership:</p>  <ol>   <li>Does this sound like a useful topic to anyone else?</li>    <li>For those who have had to work through such topics in recent (enough) memory, do you recommend any particular resources to use? (If there’s something out there that serves the purpose well – even if it doesn’t address the concepts with respect to AutoCAD’s geometry library – that would save some trouble.)</li> </ol>  <p>Please post a comment if you have anything to share on this topic.</p>
