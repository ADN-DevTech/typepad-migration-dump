<p>I arrived yesterday morning on the EasyJet flight from Geneva to Tel Aviv. I’d ended up spending the previous night at an airport hotel – I’d have had to leave home at 3:30am, otherwise – which meant a somewhat more tolerable 4:40am wake-up.</p>  <p>I admit I’d been a bit concerned about security, arriving in Israel the day after Ariel Sharon’s funeral, but it turned out to be an extremely smooth arrival. Someone with my name on a board was waiting for me at the end of the jetway and they whisked me through security and customs (I could really get used to that… a huge thank you to Etti Gazit for organising it!).</p>  <p>This was my first trip to Israel – and only my second trip to the Middle East, having had a holiday in Egypt a few years ago – and my impression of the country is that it’s somewhere between India and Italy in terms of the general feel (not just alphabetically :-). By that I mean the general level of chaos: it’s certainly less noisy and hectic than India but more so than Italy (although driving here might well be easier, based on my limited experience of being on the roads here).</p>  <p>I arrived at the office Autodesk an hour after touching down, which was much quicker that expected. The office is located right near the beachfront, an incredibly cool location. Here’s a shot taken about 200m from the office’s entrance, for instance:</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201a510eb36ed970c-pi" target="_blank"><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 20px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="Tel Aviv beachfront" border="0" alt="Tel Aviv beachfront" src="/assets/image_91970.jpg" width="420" height="320" /></a></p>  <p>And, honestly, how can you not love an office with code etched into the door? :-)</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201a510eb37d6970c-pi" target="_blank"><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 20px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="The entrance to the office" border="0" alt="The entrance to the office" src="/assets/image_866668.jpg" width="420" height="320" /></a></p>  <p>The inside of the office a beautiful space with a very contemporary design:</p>         <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201a510eb38d5970c-pi" target="_blank"><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; margin: 20px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="Inside the Tel Aviv office" border="0" alt="Inside the Tel Aviv office" src="/assets/image_182554.jpg" width="420" height="320" /></a>  <p>On arrival, I spent some time meeting with members of the AutoCAD 360 and Research teams, getting to know more about activities that take place here. Today and tomorrow I’ll be taking a deeper dive into a couple of the more interesting/important areas.</p>  <p>As <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2013/11/3d-printing-tech-previews-on-autodesk-labs-projects-miller-and-shapeshifter.html" target="_blank">I’ve mentioned before</a>, the team behind <a href="http://labs.autodesk.com/technologies/shapeshifter" target="_blank">ShapeShifter</a> is based here in Tel Aviv, and these guys have definitely had an influence on the printer area:</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201a3fc3bb899970b-pi" target="_blank"><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 20px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="The printer area" border="0" alt="The printer area" src="/assets/image_581823.jpg" width="320" height="420" /></a></p>  <p>Incidentally, you should check out the new revolve capability in <a href="http://shapeshifter.io" target="_blank">ShapeShifter</a>: it’s very cool, especially if you’re into ring design.</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201a510eb3a55970c-pi" target="_blank"><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 20px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="ShapeShifter&#39;s revolutionary (groan)" border="0" alt="ShapeShifter&#39;s revolutionary (groan)" src="/assets/image_212489.jpg" width="400" height="380" /></a></p>  <p>I’ll talk more about the trip in my next post. I fly back out to Geneva on Friday morning – which is already the weekend here in Israel, of course – and I’ll for sure have time to write an update once I get back to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Gurion_Airport" target="_blank">Ben Gurion airport</a>.</p>
