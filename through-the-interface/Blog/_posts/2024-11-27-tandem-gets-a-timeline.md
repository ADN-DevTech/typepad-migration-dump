<p>The awesome team working on Autodesk Tandem has integrated a timeline - much as we had in Project Dasher, although the implementation is different - to bring Tandem into the fourth dimension.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_916547.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Tandem timeline." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_916547.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Tandem timeline" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Here’s a video describing Tandem’s Time Navigation feature:</p>

<p>This is really exciting news for people wanting to explore historical time-series data streamed in from their facilities. Tandem now has the full set of features that once-upon-a-time allowed Dasher to be used as a “building debugger”.</p>
<p>For more information on this exciting set of time-centric features, head on over to <a href="https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/tandem-forum/feature-release-time-navigation-is-now-in-production/td-p/13175449" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the forum post</a>.</p>
