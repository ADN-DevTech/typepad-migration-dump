<p>This milestone has crept up on me, over the last few months. I guess I’ve been putting off thinking – and blogging – about it.</p><p>Earlier this year we made the decision to wind down development and support of the time-series database that serves as the back-end for <a href="https://dasher360.com" target="_blank">Project Dasher</a>. (Fun fact: this project was originally codenamed Blitzen – the name of a reindeer that was part of the “back-end” for Dasher on Santa’s sleigh – and eventually became known internally as Data 360.)</p><p>Anyway, it was time to wind it down, both because of the widespread availability of alternative cloud-based time-series databases – whether from AWS, Azure, GE, MongoDB, etc. – but also the increasing maturity of the <a href="https://intandem.autodesk.com" target="_blank">Autodesk Tandem</a> <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2023/04/streams-are-live-in-autodesk-tandem.html" target="_blank">facility monitoring</a> feature and its underlying streams implementation. Basically APS developers have lots of options, these days (not that we ever made Data 360 available publicly – other than to drive the Dasher demo – but has been clear for some time that other systems are available for Autodesk Research to use, too).</p><p>One major impact of this retirement is that – as of next week, or probably not long thereafter – the public demo of Project Dasher will no longer have sensor data when you load it.</p><p>If you’re not sure what Dasher is, here are a few screenshots of past projects, over the years.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202b751acc74a200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="312" title="NASA Ames Sustainability Base" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="NASA Ames Sustainability Base" src="/assets/image_359174.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202b751acc74e200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="312" title="Schneider Electric" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Schneider Electric" src="/assets/image_435024.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202b751acc750200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="312" title="3D skeletons on the MX3D bridge" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="3D skeletons on the MX3D bridge" src="/assets/image_402777.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202c1b25b1bd5200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="312" title="NEST building" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="NEST building" src="/assets/image_181617.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>At some point I would like to get another version of Dasher working with a similar feature-set – probably based on Tandem rather than the APS Viewer – but that’s not something that will happen soon: there are too many other things taking precedence, for now.</p><p>I know there are people out there who use Dasher as a way to demonstrate the potential for APS to deliver digital twin experiences: I sincerely hope you get this news in time, and have the opportunity to shift across to using Tandem – or screenshots/recordings you’ve taken as backups – for this.</p><p>Thank you all for your support of this project, over the years: it’s been quite the journey, and I’m happy to see the future of building web-based digital twins with Autodesk’s platform is safely in the hands of the Tandem team. Please do pay attention to what they’re doing – it’s all very exciting.</p>
