<p>During the last few days I went through and found a couple more floppies for this week’s Floppy Friday. The first contained <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rastan_(video_game)" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Rastan</a>, a game where you’re a barbarian warrior off on some kind of adventure. The second contained a game called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Druid_(video_game)" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Druid</a> (although the loader referred to it as “Druids”, for some reason), which was heavily inspired by one of my arcade favourites, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauntlet_(1985_video_game)" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Gauntlet</a>.</p>
<p>Anyway, here’s today’s episode. Enjoy!</p>

<p>I mentioned a couple of things in this episode: this week I managed to find a new joystick (in fact three of them!) which should arrive shortly.</p>

<p>I also mentioned I’m trying to resurrect my 1541 drive (right now I’m dependent on a 1541-II, which I’m not sure is working 100% perfectly). In order to do so, I picked up a few <a href="https://www.retroleum.co.uk/c64-chips" rel="noopener" target="_blank">replacement chips</a> that I’m hoping will help (at least that’s what <a href="http://personalpages.tds.net/~rcarlsen/cbm/1541/fix1541.txt" rel="noopener" target="_blank">this excellent troubleshooting guide</a> indicated was worth trying. We’ll see!). I also went ahead and picked up a <a href="http://blog.worldofjani.com/?p=2180" rel="noopener" target="_blank">diagnostic cartridge</a> (I bought mine from <a href="https://sharewareplus.blogspot.com/2015/12/world-of-jani-1541-diagnostic-cartridge.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>) which should help me troubleshoot issues with the two drives.</p>
<p>It’s important for me to keep the hardware running, because I’ve just invested in some new old floppies! I picked these up, this week, too (this is again from the auction listing, they should be arriving by post soon):</p>

<p>I just noticed on the front left floppy that Impossible Mission is probably part of this set, which should make my colleague Marco Fiocco very happy.</p>

<p>Hopefully I’ll also get a copy of TMNT (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles) that I’ll be able to load for Clint Brown, too. Fingers crossed!</p>
