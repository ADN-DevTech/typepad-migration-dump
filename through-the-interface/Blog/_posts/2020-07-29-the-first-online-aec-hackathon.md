<p>Since starting up back in 2013, the AEC Hackathon team has organised 43 in-person events in various cities around the world. This year being “special”, they’ve taken the plunge and set up a couple of online events, the first was held from July 6th-26th while the second will be held from October 9th-25th.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20264e2eb435d200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="318" title="AEC Hackathon online" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="AEC Hackathon online" src="/assets/image_220722.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>I was on holiday for the first two weeks of the July event, so could only really participate by presenting a topic during the final week.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20263ec2aad9a200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="304" title="AEC Hackathon presentations" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="AEC Hackathon presentations" src="/assets/image_192208.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Here are a couple of screenshots of me – taken from <a href="https://us02web.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_dy8KANxZTCaVIKhab_K0xw" target="_blank">the session recording</a>, which should still be available on-demand – talking about <a href="https://dasher360.com" target="_blank">Project Dasher</a>:</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20263e9591055200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="312" title="Me talking Dasher" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Me talking Dasher" src="/assets/image_724068.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20264e2eb436a200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="312" title="Also me talking Dasher" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Also me talking Dasher" src="/assets/image_518435.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>As I was a bit late to the game – and had quite a bit of work to catch up on after a couple of weeks off – I didn’t end up engaging much in this particular event. From what I can tell things went well, despite the odd unavoidable hiccough that’s inevitable when transitioning from physical to virtual.</p><p>I didn’t even have much contact with the organisers, other than chatting with <a href="https://twitter.com/MetaverseOne" target="_blank">Damon Hernandez</a> as he introduced my presentation. It’s <strong>always</strong> a huge pleasure to see Damon, even if just via Zoom.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20263ec2ab068200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="312" title="My buddy Damon" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="My buddy Damon" src="/assets/image_126401.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>From Autodesk’s side, <a href="https://twitter.com/contech101" target="_blank">Philipp Mueller</a> took the lead role in herding the various Autodesk cats, while the Developer Advocacy and Support team spent a lot of time helping out with Forge-related issues (particular <a href="https://twitter.com/AfroJme" target="_blank">Jaime Rosales</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/ipetrbroz" target="_blank">Petr Broz</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/micbeale" target="_blank">Michael Beale</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/augustomaia" target="_blank">Augusto Goncalves</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/AdamTheNagy" target="_blank">Adam Nagy</a>, but quite possibly others, too). I know <a href="https://twitter.com/ShaanHurley" target="_blank">Shaan Hurley</a> is a big advocate of the event, and was definitely involved at some level.</p><p>Phil and Jaime also helped judge the various entries:</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20263e9591067200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="191" title="Hackathon judges" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Hackathon judges" src="/assets/image_652472.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Something I’ve been heartened to see over the course of a number of recent Forge Accelerators and AEC Hackathons is the increased adoption of Forge for the visualisation of “Digital Twins”, which definitely validates our focus on this area. For instance, <a href="https://youtu.be/k5DRweMWAzg" target="_blank">one of the winning entries in the Copenhagen Hackathon from earlier in the year</a> was on exactly this theme, and the winner of this event’s “Best BIM 360 project” was along similar lines.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20264e2eb406f200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="485" height="375" title="Winning certificate" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Winning certificate" src="/assets/image_463908.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>I was very intrigued by <a href="https://devpost.com/software/bim-to-devs" target="_blank">the BIM-to-DEVS project</a> coming out of <a href="https://arslab.sce.carleton.ca/" target="_blank">Carleton University’s Advanced Real Time Data Simulation Lab</a> supervised by Professor Gabriel Wainer: the main goal was to use Forge to display the results of some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DEVS" target="_blank">Discrete Event Simulation (DEVS)</a> results. My colleague, Rhys Goldstein – a huge proponent of the use of DEVS as a simulation framework – made me aware of their efforts before they’d even started. That said, I didn’t really check in on the project until they had already finished and been awarded their prize (Michael Beale was apparently the main person helping them with their Forge-related questions).</p><p>The BIM-to-DEVS team used a slightly differently technique to Dasher’s to visualise the results – they rendered a point cloud rather than shading a volume – but there are a lot of similarities in terms of their overall approach.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20263e9590d75200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="353" title="BIM-to-DEVS" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="BIM-to-DEVS" src="/assets/image_161717.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20263e9590d79200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="352" title="BIM-to-DEVS point cloud" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="BIM-to-DEVS point cloud" src="/assets/image_124712.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>We’ve talked a lot about how we’ll eventually solve this for displaying simulation results inside Dasher, and this kind of approach is certainly one we’ll consider (as opposed to – or in addition to – stuffing the results into the time-series database to visualise from there).</p><p>Here’s a video showing their process:</p><p align="center"><br></p><p align="center"><iframe width="500" height="283" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/iLtuyHXCn9I" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"></iframe></p><p><br></p><p>If you’re interested in learning more about this project, be sure to check out <a href="https://devpost.com/software/bim-to-devs" target="_blank">this detailed blog post</a> and <a href="https://github.com/SimulationEverywhere/BIM-to-DEVS" target="_blank">their GitHub repository</a>.</p><p>Congratulations to all the participants, winners, supporters and organisers of this ground-breaking online Hackathon!</p><p>I have a feeling that we’ll end up seeing a mix of virtual and physical as we move into 2021: it’s great to have in-person events, but the reach afforded by going virtual is so much larger. I’m looking forward to participating in both October’s online event and next year’s in-person event in Zurich!</p>
