<p>It’s suddenly Thursday morning. I feel like I’ve been in one of <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/redmond/projects/hyperlapse">those hyperlapse videos</a> since <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2014/12/autodesk-university-2014-day-1.html">my last blog post</a>. Here’s a quick update on what I’ve been up to.</p>  <p>When I wrote my last post I was actually sitting in on <a href="https://events.au.autodesk.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=5577">Albert Szilvasy’s AutoCAD I/O session</a>. This very interesting class was recorded so be sure to watch it when it comes online.</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b7c7179c6d970b-pi" target="_blank"><img title="Albert I-O" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 20px auto; border-left: 0px; display: block; padding-right: 0px" border="0" alt="Albert I-O" src="/assets/image_222584.jpg" width="410" height="239" /></a></p>  <p>From there I headed to the Exhibit Hall. This year the Exhibit Hall at AU is just incredible. I don’t know what’s changed, exactly, but I just love the way it’s been laid out. And I’ve really enjoyed wandering around talking to people on the various stands.</p>  <p>It was great to see <a href="http://spark.autodesk.com/ember-explorer">the new Ember 3D printer</a> in action:</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b7c7179c75970b-pi" target="_blank"><img title="Autodesk Ember" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 20px auto; border-left: 0px; display: block; padding-right: 0px" border="0" alt="Autodesk Ember" src="/assets/image_563193.jpg" width="220" height="376" /></a></p>  <p>I snuck back into the Exhibit Hall when it was closed to have my photo taken sitting in <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2014/10/update-on-spark-autodesks-3d-printing-platform.html">the world’s first 3D printed car</a>.</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b7c7179c79970b-pi" target="_blank"><img title="Sitting in the Local Motors Strati" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 20px auto; border-left: 0px; display: block; padding-right: 0px" border="0" alt="Sitting in the Local Motors Strati" src="/assets/image_68977.jpg" width="410" height="239" /></a></p>  <p>It was great to see <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2014/03/configuring-3-wheelers-at-the-geneva-motor-show.html">the Morgan configurator</a> on display across the way:</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b8d0a1a406970c-pi" target="_blank"><img title="The Morgan configurator" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 20px auto; border-left: 0px; display: block; padding-right: 0px" border="0" alt="The Morgan configurator" src="/assets/image_360638.jpg" width="410" height="239" /></a></p>  <p>And yes, AutoCAD was everywhere. :-)</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201bb07bc9202970d-pi" target="_blank"><img title="AutoCAD is everywhere" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 20px auto; border-left: 0px; display: block; padding-right: 0px" border="0" alt="AutoCAD is everywhere" src="/assets/image_429778.jpg" width="410" height="239" /></a></p>  <p>Wednesday was my busiest day, presentation-wise. In the morning I talked to a roomful of people interested in AutoCAD’s JavaScript API and then to a smaller (but very engaged) crowd about connecting AutoCAD to SensorTag in the afternoon. The day’s presentations ended with a panel session about Autodesk’s Cloud and Mobile APIs, which was really interesting.</p>  <p>After dropping my bag back in my hotel room, I headed on down to <a href="http://www.minus5experience.com">Minus5</a>, to meet with some customers (it was great to meet you, Jim and Dan :-). It was quite surreal chatting about AutoCAD in a fur coat and hat, sipping a mojito from a glass made out of ice. That was a first for me, at least. Although I suppose going to an ice bar in the middle of the desert isn’t much stranger than having a sauna in Switzerland. ;-)</p>  <p>While in Minus5 I ran into Marion Pietsch, an old friend, and we had our picture taken in our “Narnia” get-up:</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b8d0a1a412970c-pi" target="_blank"><img title="With Marion in the Minus 5 ice bar" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 20px auto; border-left: 0px; display: block; padding-right: 0px" border="0" alt="With Marion in the Minus 5 ice bar" src="/assets/image_853208.jpg" width="367" height="278" /></a></p>  <p>From there I headed off to the <a href="http://autodesk.blogs.com/between_the_lines/2014/11/autodesk-university-2014-blogger-and-social-meetup-invites-and-news.html">Blogger and Social Meetup</a>, in the <a href="http://www.rira.com/las-vegas">Rí Rá Irish pub</a>, where I had the chance to sit down and talk to a number of really interesting people. There were a number of representatives from <a href="http://www.madeinspace.us">Made in Space</a>, who have used Autodesk tools to design the first zero-G 3D printer.</p>  <p>A highlight of the event was chatting at length with <a href="https://twitter.com/tjmccue">TJ McCue</a>, fresh off his fascinating <a href="http://3drv.com/">3DRV tour</a>. Here I am with TJ and Karen Mason, a friend and colleague from the AutoCAD team.</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b7c7179c7d970b-pi" target="_blank"><img title="At the blogger social with Karen and TJ" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 20px auto; border-left: 0px; display: block; padding-right: 0px" border="0" alt="At the blogger social with Karen and TJ" src="/assets/image_456020.jpg" width="410" height="239" /></a></p>      <p>Right now I’m sitting in the Answer Bar, but I’ll soon head off for a bite to eat ahead of my last commitment of this year’s AU, presenting a quick introduction at <a href="https://events.au.autodesk.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=7322">Jason Walter’s class</a> on the Morgan configurator his team implemented for the Geneva Motor Show.</p>  <p>I’ll certainly live-tweet the closing session before heading to the closing party, marking the end of yet another great AU!</p>
