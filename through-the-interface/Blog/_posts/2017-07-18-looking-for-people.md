They’re struggling to fill a few roles, and Ron reached out to see whether I knew anyone. I suggested I could do better than that and post on this blog to see if any of its readers out there are interested in what Ron had to say.</p><p>Here’s the bulk of Ron’s email:</p><blockquote><p><em>I’m reaching out to see if you have any recommendations for some positions we have open and are struggling to fill.</em><p><em>First, we’re looking for a strong Product Manager for our HOOPS Exchange and HOOPS Publish products. The development of the products is in Lyon France, so that’s an ideal location, but we’re more interested in finding just the right person – so we’re flexible on location. They should have experience in data exchange.</em><p><em>Next we’re looking for Consulting Engineers for both Europe and the USA. The pace of companies evaluating our technologies has continued to accelerate and the # of Consulting Engineers has become a bottleneck to growth. People who are successful in this role have reasonably good coding skills, experience with developing CAD/CAM applications and are good at communicating. East coast is preferred for the US positions and Germany for Europe, but we're willing to be flexible for the right person!</em><p><em>Do you know of any people who might be a good fit?</em></p></blockquote><p align="left">If anyone is interested in finding out more, be sure to head on over to <a href="http://techsoft3d.com/company/careers" target="_blank">Tech Soft 3D’s website</a>.<p align="left">On a related note, Autodesk is also looking for good consultants. Here’s the description I received the other day for a job in the UK:<blockquote><p><em>Autodesk Consulting is seeking a talented Technical Consultant to work with our key customers in order to design, develop and support customized and configured solutions for their Enterprise Application (EA) integrations with cloud based technologies. This individual will work directly with customers to understand their EA integration needs and provide custom solutions built on Autodesk Cloud and On Premise Products.</em><p><em>Responsibilities:</em><ul><li><em>Work with customers to review their EA integration needs</em><li><em>Configuration of Autodesk products according to customer requirements</em><li><em>Produce written documentation of solutions and configuration activities</em><li><em>Develop customized and configured solutions on top of Autodesk core products</em><li><em>Establish credibility at all levels with clients and build problem-solving partnerships with clients and colleagues</em><li><em>Contribute to Autodesk IP and assets through methods development and sales collateral</em><li><em>Lead training and adoption efforts for customers</em></li></ul></blockquote><p align="left">For more information about this posting, head across to <a href="https://autodesk.taleo.net/careersection/adsk_gen/jobdetail.ftl?job=17WD24270" target="_blank">Autodesk’s careers portal</a>.
