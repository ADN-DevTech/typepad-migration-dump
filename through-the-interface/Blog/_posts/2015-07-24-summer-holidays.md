<p>I’ve been trying hard to keep up my blogging rhythm, through the summer, but some weeks it’s just hard. I’m currently enjoying an extended <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staycation" target="_blank">staycation</a> with the family – and the weather in Switzerland has been simply amazing, this year, thankfully – and this week I just haven’t found the time for my usual 3rd post. So here’s a quick photo of a local field of sunflowers.</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b8d13cf0bf970c-pi" target="_blank"><img title="Sunflowers" style="float: none; margin: 40px auto; display: block" alt="Sunflowers" src="/assets/image_919031.jpg" width="400" height="226" /></a></p>  <p>Happy summer, everyone!</p>
