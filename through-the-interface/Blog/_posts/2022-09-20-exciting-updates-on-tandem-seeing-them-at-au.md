<p>If you didn’t get the chance to watch last week’s webinar by the Autodesk Tandem team – their September 2022 webinar – then I highly recommend <a href="https://intandem.autodesk.com/resource/september-2022-webinar/" target="_blank">checking out the recording</a>, especially if you’re interested in updates to their work on displaying sensor data.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202a308e0c80b200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="281" title="Tandem's got heatmaps" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Tandem's got heatmaps" src="/assets/image_815735.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>If you liked <a href="https://dasher360.com" target="_blank">Project Dasher</a>, you’re going to love the work that’s being done in Tandem. :-)</p><p>Questions were asked during the webinar about attendees’ interests regarding workflows for heatmaps:</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202a30d4e1d2b200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="281" title="Heatmap questions" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Heatmap questions" src="/assets/image_993101.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>If you missed the chance to vote – but have strong opinions on these workflows and would like to provide detailed feedback – then you can <a href="https://intandem.autodesk.com/contact-us/?form_type=contact#contact-forms" target="_blank">contact the Tandem team directly</a>. They would love to hear from you.</p><p>I’m really excited about all that’s coming: the combination of Tandem’s rich data environment with 3D visualization capabilities is going to prove really compelling, in my opinion. This should come as a surprise to absolutely no-one, given our work on Dasher.</p><p>Here’s a nice example from the latest webinar, where HVAC elements with out-of-range sensor values are highlighted in red. Yes, this is a 2D view but that’s really just a detail.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202a2eed6caa4200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="281" title="Sensors out of range" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Sensors out of range" src="/assets/image_909941.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>If you want to find out more about Tandem at next week’s Autodesk University in New Orleans, then there are a number of sessions listed in <a href="https://autodeskuniversity.smarteventscloud.com/cap/app/sessions" target="_blank">the class catalog</a>, including <a href="https://autodeskuniversity.smarteventscloud.com/cap/app/sessions#675178" target="_blank">this panel session run by Bob Bray</a>. I also recommend visiting the Tandem booth at the Architecture, Building Engineering and Civil Infrastructure area of the Autodesk stand in the exhibit hall. I’ll be mostly across the way in either the Design &amp; Manufacturing area (more on that soon) or in the Forge area.</p>
