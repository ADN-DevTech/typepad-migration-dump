<p>To celebrate my second son’s 5th birthday (<a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2006/09/a_quick_announc.html" target="_blank">how time flies!</a>), we visited <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disneyland_Paris" target="_blank">Disneyland Paris</a> for the long weekend here in Switzerland (it was the Jeûne Fédéral, or Federal Fasting Holiday, which apparently has <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Je%C3%BBne_genevois" target="_blank">its roots back in the 15th century</a>). We arrived back, late last night, by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TGV" target="_blank">TGV</a> from Paris to Neuchâtel.</p>  <p>Aside from being a lot of fun with the kids, it was also quite nostalgic, as my wife and I had last stayed – back in the days before children – at the particular hotel we chose (<a href="http://hotels.disneylandparis.co.uk/hotels/newport-bay-club/index.xhtml#" target="_blank">the Newport Bay Club</a>), during Autodesk’s Developer Days event back in 2000. Ah, the memories.</p>  <p>Anyway – I do expect to follow up with further posts, this week, although my AU material preparation is quickly rising up my “to do” list, and may start to eat away at the time I can devote to blogging.</p>
