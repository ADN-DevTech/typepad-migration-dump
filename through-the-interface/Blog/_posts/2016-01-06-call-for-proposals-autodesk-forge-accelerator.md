I say it’s the first, but it’s really a rebranding of the Autodesk <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2014/11/2015-autodesk-cloud-accelerator.html" target="_blank">Cloud</a> <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2015/09/at-the-cloud-accelerator-in-prague.html" target="_blank">Accelerators</a> that were held earlier this year to have <a href="http://forge.autodesk.com" target="_blank">the same moniker</a> as <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2015/12/autodesk-gets-serious-about-web-services-forge.html" target="_blank">the recently announced developer platform, fund and conference</a>.</p>  <p>The “<a href="http://autodeskcloudaccelerator.com/apply/" target="_blank">call for proposals</a>” started <a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/cloud_and_mobile/2015/12/apply-to-attend-the-forge-accelerator.html" target="_blank">just before the holiday break</a>, and will remain open until <strong>January 31, 2016</strong>. So there are just over 3 weeks left to submit your sub-2,000 word proposal on how you intend to use an Autodesk web-service API during the accelerator. These currently include View &amp; Data, AutoCAD I/O, Fusion 360, BIM 360 and ReCap 360 APIs.</p>  <p>If your proposal gets accepted, Autodesk will cover your accommodation costs for the duration of the event. It’ll be up to you to cover travel and other living costs.</p>  <p>I don’t know whether I’ll be attending this one – I’ll be in Munich in a couple of weeks for the one there, however. They’re definitely very worthwhile events!</p>
