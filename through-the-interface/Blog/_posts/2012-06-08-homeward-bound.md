<p>I’ve spent the best part of the last two weeks in the Bay Area, which has been fantastic. It was great to attend Autodesk’s annual, internal Tech Summit, both to network with colleagues and to find out about some of the really interesting projects being worked on within the company. It was also really good to reconnect with members of the AutoCAD Engineering and ADN teams.</p>  <p>While there’s been quite a lot of work over the last few weeks, there has also been some time for play:</p>  <ul>   <li>The evening social event at San Francisco’s <a href="http://www.techshop.ws/" target="_blank">TechShop</a>. </li>    <li><a href="http://www.napavalleybiketours.com" target="_blank">Renting bikes</a> in Napa Valley and cycling (at times a little unsteadily) between some <a href="http://www.frogsleap.com" target="_blank">excellent</a> <a href="http://goosecross.com">wineries</a>. </li>    <li>Sailing with friends in the San Francisco Bay. </li>    <li>Watching the inaugural game of the <a href="http://www.pacificsbaseball.com" target="_blank">San Rafael Pacifics</a> minor-league baseball team. </li>    <li>Lots of sushi. :-) </li> </ul>  <p>It’s now time to head back across the pond to Switzerland, though: it seems like far too long since I’ve seen my kids, in particular, and it’ll be good to get back into my exercise regimen (we have our European soccer tournament coming up in early July, and I’ve been a bit lazy while over here, admittedly).</p>  <p>Ah yes, and with <a href="http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro/season=2012/matches/index.html" target="_blank">Euro 2012</a> kicking off, I also have some serious football watching (and perhaps a little beer drinking) to get started on. Come on England!</p>
