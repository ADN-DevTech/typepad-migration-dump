<p>Dynamo 2.15 was released into the wild, last Thursday (at least via Dynamo Core, if not yet Dynamo for Revit), and as Sol Amour says in <a href="https://dynamobim.org/dynamo-core-2-15-release/" target="_blank">his blog post</a>, it is “an <strong>absolutely epic</strong> release”. </p><p>I’d seen it flash by, but only sat up to take proper notice when <a href="https://twitter.com/solamour/status/1545400251397308418" target="_blank">Sol pinged me on Twitter</a> to mention that includes capabilities inspired by <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2018/07/introducing-warnamo-a-dynamo-package-for-managing-warnings-and-errors.html" target="_blank">Warnamo</a>, a package I wrote to help keep track of warnings and errors in Dynamo.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202a2eecc97e8200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="376" height="500" title="Sol's shout-out" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Sol's shout-out" src="/assets/image_189511.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>So I decided to dig into some of the new features – a great resource for this being <a href="https://github.com/DynamoDS/Dynamo/wiki/Release-Notes" target="_blank">the habitually comprehensive Dynamo release notes</a>.</p><p>I also checked out this recording of a livestream by our friend Jon Pierson, who dug into several of the new features.</p><p align="center"><br></p><p align="center"><iframe width="500" height="283" title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hnlaZqkobyo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"></iframe></p><p><br></p><p>To look into the way warnings and errors are managed inside the new Dynamo version, I unwired a node in <a href="https://autode.sk/mars-graph" target="_blank">the MaRS graph</a> (which I’m happy to say worked well once I’d upgraded the Solar Analysis package to v1.12… thinking about it I could have just used the Solar Analysis node warnings as an example, but at that point I was more worried about making sure the graph still worked than I was about documenting this feature), which caused 8 warnings to appear.</p><p>Zooming to each of these warnings was easy: I could just click the button to the right of the “<em>Run completed with warnings</em>” message to cycle through them, zooming into each warning with the current zoom level on each click. (Warnamo did change the zoom level, which may or may not be what you’re looking for… in any case I respect the Dynamo team’s decision not to mess with that.)</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202a2eecc9771200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="281" title="Error cycling" style="margin: 30px auto; float: none; display: block;" alt="Error cycling" src="/assets/image_687630.jpg"></a></p><p>You can also bring up the Graph Node Manager via Dynamo’s <em>Extensions</em> menu. This is a much more complete place to manage the nodes in your graph – including any warnings or errors – and so far it seems incredibly handy.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202a2eecc98c9200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="281" title="Using the graph node manager to show warnings inside a Dynamo graph" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Using the graph node manager to show warnings inside a Dynamo graph" src="/assets/image_405013.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>I’m not even scratching the surface with this new feature and I’ve found that with just a clicks I can list all the graph’s nodes that interface with the Generative Design feature inside Revit, whether marked as inputs or outputs. This is super useful.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202a30d43f64f200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="281" title="GD inputs in the MaRS graph" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="GD inputs in the MaRS graph" src="/assets/image_152832.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>I have a feeling that this is soon going to be one of those features that regularly makes me wonder how I ever managed without it. And this is just one feature in this “absolutely epic” release, so I suggest heading on over to <a href="https://dynamobuilds.com" target="_blank">DynamoBuilds.com</a> to check it out!</p>
