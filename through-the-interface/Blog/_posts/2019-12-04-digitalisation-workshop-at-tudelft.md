<p>After not being good for very much last week – while recovering from <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2019/11/wrapping-up-autodesk-university-2019.html" target="_blank">AU in Las Vegas</a> – I headed back across to the Netherlands on Monday afternoon.<p>In Geneva airport there was a large stuffed reindeer just sitting there. A huge thanks to Ben Rand for <a href="https://twitter.com/leadensky/status/1201862251876995072" target="_blank">pointing out the obvious</a>: that Rudolph is probably a big fan of Project Dasher! :-)<p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4a4e61d200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Reindeer" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Reindeer" src="/assets/image_2014.jpg" border="0"></a></p>
  <p>I took the train from Schipol down to Delft, which was feeling very festive.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4f2bcc8200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Trains" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Trains" src="/assets/image_106229.jpg" border="0"></a></p>
  <p>I love Dutch train stations and the connectivity between multi- and two-wheeled transport.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4f2bcd0200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Bikes" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Bikes" src="/assets/image_680705.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4ce127b200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Train station" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Train station" src="/assets/image_482286.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>I had a very nice room in a hotel close to the <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/en/" target="_blank">Delft University of Technology</a> campus called Casa Julia.</p><p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4f2bcd8200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Suite" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Suite" src="/assets/image_411326.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>I headed back out to the centre of Delft for dinner. The city was very quiet on a mid-week night in early December.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4a4e629200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Trees" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Trees" src="/assets/image_735178.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4f2bce0200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Canals" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Canals" src="/assets/image_921896.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Heading back to the hotel I had to wait for the bridge to close – I remember having this happen the last time I visited Delft at exactly the same bridge. I wonder how often boats come through…</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4a4e62d200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Bridge" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Bridge" src="/assets/image_855207.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4ce127f200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="375" height="500" title="Coming down" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Coming down" src="/assets/image_188785.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Tuesday morning was brisk but (eventually) bright.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4f2bce8200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="TUDelft" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="TUDelft" src="/assets/image_494661.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>The event was a workshop on Digitalisation in AEC, with the idea of helping the Faculty of Architecture and The Built Environment at TU Delft plan for the changes happening in industry.</p><p>The day was split into 10-minute sessions presented by both TU Delft professors and external parties such as myself.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4ce1283200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="375" height="500" title="The tyranny of the 10-minute timer" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="The tyranny of the 10-minute timer" src="/assets/image_672178.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>I had a chuckle at one point when I saw the list of presentations. Mine was basically all videos (with a few static images), so it weighed in much heavier than most. (Some of the below were admittedly placeholders that got replaced by larger files, but mine still “won” by some margin. ;-)</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4f2bcf4200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Spot the Autodesk presentation" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Spot the Autodesk presentation" src="/assets/image_922717.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Here are snapshots from some of the presentations. The event was well-attended, and I was very pleased to see so many students in the audience.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4a4e63d200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Paul Chan from TUDelft" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Paul Chan from TUDelft" src="/assets/image_256106.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4ce1288200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="A good crowd" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="A good crowd" src="/assets/image_762658.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4ce128c200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Definition of Digitalisation" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Definition of Digitalisation" src="/assets/image_791511.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4a4e646200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Matthe van Baalen from ARCADIS" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Matthe van Baalen from ARCADIS" src="/assets/image_936651.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4ce1294200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Johan Hannegraaf from Arkio" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Johan Hannegraaf from Arkio" src="/assets/image_315091.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4f2bd00200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Giovanni Betti from HENN" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Giovanni Betti from HENN" src="/assets/image_559119.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4f2bd08200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Janneke Kamstra from RVB" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Janneke Kamstra from RVB" src="/assets/image_553354.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>My session came quite late in the agenda, and I focused my 10 minutes primarily on some of the projects we’ve implemented using <a href="http://dasher360.com" target="_blank">Dasher 360</a>, as well as some talk of Generative Design in the AEC space.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4f2bd10200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Me" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Me" src="/assets/image_918518.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>In case you’re wondering, the flooring is actually carpet made to look like wood. Interesting.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4f2bd0c200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Yes it's carpet" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Yes it's carpet" src="/assets/image_404265.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Autodesk wasn’t the only “vendor” present: I was followed by Niels from ESRI, for instance.</p><p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4ce12a2200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Niels van der Vaart from ESRI" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Niels van der Vaart from ESRI" src="/assets/image_752855.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>After a jam-packed day of content, the faculty’s Dean wrapped up proceedings.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4a4e653200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Wrap-up by the Dean" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Wrap-up by the Dean" src="/assets/image_2190.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>I unfortunately couldn’t stay for drinks as I had to head up to Amsterdam to have dinner. I did so via a couple of jam-packed trains.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4a4e65b200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="375" height="500" title="Crowded train" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Crowded train" src="/assets/image_148687.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>I made it to dinner on time. We were meeting to discuss the following day’s event: when I knew I was coming to the Netherlands I had reached out to Sander Lijbers in case he wanted to organise a customer visit or two. In typical Sander style, he somehow managed to organise an event where 20+ people would come together in our Amsterdam office – some flying in from London – to talk about Generative Design.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4f2bd16200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Dinner" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Dinner" src="/assets/image_211205.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>It was an interesting meal, and not only because <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazuo_Inamori" target="_blank">the CEO of Kyocera</a> and his 30+ person entourage were having drinks in the space next to us. Dinner and a show!</p><p>It was great to meet Ed and Cristian, as well as catch up with Radu, Sander and Dieter. I’ll post more on the following day’s event in my next post.</p></p></p>
