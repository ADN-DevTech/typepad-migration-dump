Here’s a screenshot of my own welcome page on the Autodesk Community, for instance:</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2019b016ab858970b-pi" target="_blank"><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 20px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="Autodesk Community welcome page" border="0" alt="Autodesk Community welcome page" src="/assets/image_364491.jpg" width="470" height="362" /></a></p>  <p>Yes, it’s been a while since my last forum post. Must do better on that front.</p>  <p>The site certainly seems a lot more useable post-redesign. I do recommend taking a look and posting any support questions you might have over there (unless they’re specifically related to code I’ve posted here, in which case please do post a blog comment).</p>  <p>The main <a href="http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/custom/page/page-id/Discussions-Page" target="_blank">forums</a> of interest on the Autodesk Community for readers of this blog are likely to be those that relate to <a href="http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/AutoCAD-Customization/ct-p/AutoCADTopic1" target="_blank">AutoCAD Customization</a>, more specifically <a href="http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/NET/bd-p/152" target="_blank">.NET</a>, <a href="http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/Autodesk-ObjectARX/bd-p/34" target="_blank">ObjectARX</a>, <a href="http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/Visual-LISP-AutoLISP-and-General/bd-p/130" target="_blank">LISP &amp; general</a> and <a href="http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/Visual-Basic-Customization/bd-p/33" target="_blank">Visual Basic</a>. The forums are also linked to from <a href="http://autodesk.com/developautocad" target="_blank">the AutoCAD Developer Center</a>, for those who haven’t been there in a while.</p>  <p>The other place to hang out for developers working with AutoCAD is, of course, <a href="http://theswamp.org" target="_blank">The Swamp</a>. You’ll find a lot of useful advice over there, too, in an environment that’s not managed by Autodesk (for those who prefer that).</p>
