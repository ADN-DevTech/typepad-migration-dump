<p>I’m hopping on a plane tomorrow to head across to the Bay Area for a week – I have some internal meetings to attend there. This is the first time I’m flying direct from Switzerland – Swiss now run a direct flight from Zurich to SFO – so that’s something, I suppose. I actually have a few more long-haul trips planned over the coming months, but hopefully I’ll manage to keep on posting regularly (I’ve become quite spoiled with having so much less travel since I changing jobs at the beginning of last year). It’s typical that the travel starts to build up just as the sun starts to shine. But anyway – I really have nothing to complain about.</p>  <p>On the technical side, I’d hoped to have something more interesting to post today, but a couple of the projects I’m working on have hit a wall and need some further attention to break on through. I’ll be sharing more on those in the coming days/weeks, I expect (along with more detailed information on the AutoCAD 2014 APIs, as promised a few weeks ago).</p>  <p>Have a great weekend, everyone!</p>
