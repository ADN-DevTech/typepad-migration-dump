<p>I’ve been interested in participating in – or at least attending – an <a href="http://aechackathon.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">AEC Hackathon</a> for a couple of years now. I was first introduced to them during the VR Hackathons I attended in SF in 2014 and 2015 (Damon, Greg and Paul, who help organize the AEC Hackathons, were also organizing/involved in/attending the VR ones).</p>
<p>There are a number of AEC Hackathons planned for Europe over the coming months, so I’m happy to say I’ll finally get my chance. I’ve been asked to present at the first – which is <a href="http://www.aechackathon-germany.de" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in Munich from March 31st – April 2nd</a> – and with any luck I’ll also be able to attend one in Zurich, too.</p>
<p>To understand a bit more about the concept behind AEC Hackathons – and how they work – here’s a quick video:</p>

<p>Here’s some additional information copied from the <a href="http://aechackathon.com/about-us" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">AEC Hackathon about page</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The AEC (Architecture, Engineering, Construction) Hackathon was created to give those designing, building, and maintaining our built environment the opportunity to collaborate with cutting edge technologies and its developers and designers. It’s a weekend of geeking at its finest for improving the industries that affect all that live or work in a house or building. It has quickly become a global community of innovators that include all elements of the built environment. </em></p>
<p><em>The weekend gives attendees the chance to be exposed to and work with the latest high tech tools provided by supporters, sponsors, and fellow community members. Not all built environment professionals have to code or have much background with tech. Just come with your knowledge, an open mind, collaborative spirit, and willinginess to solve Mon-Fri problems leveraging all kinds of technology.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the Munich session there’ll be a number of technology sessions regarding <u>Robotics</u>, <u>Generative</u> <u>Design</u>, <u>IoT</u>, <u>AR/VR</u> and <u>web services</u>.</p>
