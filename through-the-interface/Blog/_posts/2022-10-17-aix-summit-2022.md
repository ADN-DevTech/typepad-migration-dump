<p>On Friday I hopped on a train to Zurich to attend the <a href="https://ai.ethz.ch/industry/AIplusX/aixsummit22.html" target="_blank">AI+X Summit 2022</a> event – organised by the <a href="https://ai.ethz.ch/" target="_blank">ETH AI Center</a> – which was co-located with the <a href="https://www.entrepreneur-club.org/" target="_blank">ETH Entrepreneur Club</a>’s <a href="https://www.entrepreneur-club.org/launch" target="_blank">Launch</a> event.</p><p>It was a lovely autumn day, and the colours were even on display in Zurich’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oerlikon_(Z%C3%BCrich)" target="_blank">Oerlikon</a> district.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202a2eed9cb29200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="An autumnal park in Zurich" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="An autumnal park in Zurich" src="/assets/image_523816.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202a2eed9cb2d200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="And from the front" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="And from the front" src="/assets/image_234440.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>The event was held at <a href="https://www.stage-one.ch/en.html" target="_blank">Stage One</a>, an event space a short walk from the Oerlikon train station.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202acc610045f200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="375" height="500" title="The ETH AI Center and its workshops" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="The ETH AI Center and its workshops" src="/assets/image_385969.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>I was mainly there for the AI+AEC workshop, but there were a number of mainstage presentations and exhibits by startups and larger companies involved in AI.</p><p>The workshops were held upstairs, above the exhibition space.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202a308e3cab3200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="375" height="500" title="Reason for being" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Reason for being" src="/assets/image_244117.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>As a warm-up for the AEC-centric session, I sat in on the AI+Sustainability session, which comprised of four separate talks followed by a panel discussion.</p><p>The first was by David Dao, who talked about the use of AI with satellite imagery to understand and predict deforestation.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202a2eed9cb3c200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="David Dao from ETHZ and GainForest" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="David Dao from ETHZ and GainForest" src="/assets/image_789318.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Next was Thomas Brunshwiler from IBM Research, who talked about various activities they’re engaged in, mainly using geospatial and satellite data to do things such as classifying flood damage.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202acc6100471200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Thomas Brunschwiler from IBM Research" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Thomas Brunschwiler from IBM Research" src="/assets/image_839.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Christoph Goessman from ETH talked about his work on the SDG monitor, a tool to understand international progress towards the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202a308e3cab7200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Christoph Goessmann from ETH" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Christoph Goessmann from ETH" src="/assets/image_158986.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Panagiotis Martakis from Seismohealth talked about their use of AI to predict seismic damage to infrastructure.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202a308e3cabf200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Panagiotis Martakis from Seismohealth" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Panagiotis Martakis from Seismohealth" src="/assets/image_353872.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>In between workshop sessions I had a quick walk around to see the exhibits on display. There really was a huge variety of companies present, from robotics startups to established law firms.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202acc6100479200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="View from the balcony" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="View from the balcony" src="/assets/image_193485.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>I also poked my nose into the mainstage area, although I didn’t end up staying to watch the presentations there.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202a2eed9cb48200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Menna El-Assady from ETH on mainstage" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Menna El-Assady from ETH on mainstage" src="/assets/image_678377.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>The AI+AEC workshop was being run by the <a href="https://designplusplus.ethz.ch/" target="_blank">Design++</a> team from ETH. I’ve been connected with this team for some time, but hadn’t yet had the chance to meet any of the team in person.</p><p>It turns out I presented the <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwHQStO10FDfeiX_Qrp11Z9-cdqAAyxCX" target="_blank">inaugural online lecture for Design++ two years ago</a>, so it was definitely time to meet in person!</p><p><br></p><p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p align="center" lang="en" dir="ltr">Great talk this morning on Generative Design <a href="https://twitter.com/autodesk?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@autodesk</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/keanw?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@keanw</a>. This was our inaugural lecture for the Design++ computationally augmented design in AEC lecture series.

I chose to be on the Architect team, given my focus on <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2022/09/human-centric-building-design.html" target="_blank">human-centric building design</a>.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202a2eed9cb74200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="The workshop" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="The workshop" src="/assets/image_985551.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>After the workshop was finished, I headed back to the exhibit floor where the Design++ team presented a few different posters. I was happy to see Dynamo was used extensively for <a href="https://mkrausai.github.io/research/01_SciML/01_BH_PedestrianBridge_XAI/" target="_blank">this particular project</a> presented by Vera Balmer.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202a308e3dfc2200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="375" height="500" title="An interesting poster" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="An interesting poster" src="/assets/image_28205.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>After a nice chat over a few beers with the team, I headed homewards.</p><p>I love all the seasons in Switzerland, and one of this season’s features are the hot chestnut stalls that pop up all over.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202a308e3cd59200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="478" height="391" title="Hot chestnuts for the train home" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Hot chestnuts for the train home" src="/assets/image_388393.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Many thanks to all at the ETH AI Center – and those from Design++ who organised the AI+AEC session – for the great event. I spent an enjoyable – and very thought-provoking – afternoon in Zurich!</p>
