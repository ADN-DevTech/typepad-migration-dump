<p>I’m this week’s “expert” over on <a href="http://autocad.autodesk.com">the AutoCAD Exchange</a>:</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20120a5a33328970b-pi"><img style="border-right-width: 0px; margin: 0px auto; display: block; float: none; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" title="AutoCAD Exchange - Ask the Expert" border="0" alt="AutoCAD Exchange - Ask the Expert" src="/assets/image_322286.jpg" width="327" height="296" /></a></p>  <p>I don’t know whether people visiting that site will be interested in asking programming-related questions, but as I’m routinely re-directing support questions I receive by email or as blog comments across to <a href="http://adn.autodesk.com">the ADN site</a> or to <a href="http://discussion.autodesk.com">our discussion groups</a>, I thought I’d point this blog’s readership at the chance to get questions answered without me wriggling out of them. :-)</p>  <p>Go on – <a href="http://autocad.autodesk.com/?nd=ask_the_expert&amp;topic_id=29&amp;moderator_id=32">ask me a question</a>!</p>
