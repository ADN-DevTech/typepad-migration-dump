<p>I had the great pleasure of attending the first half (give or take) of the recent <a href="http://aechackathon-germany.de" target="_blank">AEC Hackathon in Munich</a>. It was held over the first weekend of my kids’ school holidays, so I ended up having to compromise on attending the full event: I flew in on Friday afternoon – with just enough time for <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2017/04/a-visit-to-autodesk-munichs-vr-center-of-excellence.html" target="_blank">some VR fun at our Munich office</a> – and flew back home on Saturday afternoon. So I didn’t get to attend the really fun piece – seeing the results of the weekend’s efforts – but I will talk in this post about what I did get the chance to see.</p> <p>The event was hosted on the 5th floor of the main <a href="https://www.tum.de/en/homepage" target="_blank">TUM</a> building. For Friday’s kick-off it was a beautiful, unseasonably warm evening, and our event shared a very small elevator with what seemed to be the most popular bar on the TUM campus, so it was a bit of a struggle getting up and down. The two events ended up having very different attendees, but – perhaps surprisingly – I was actually very happy to be stuck inside with my fellow AEC Hackathoners. :-)</p> <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201bb098d96f8970d-pi" target="_blank"><img title="A good-sized crowd for the opening" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 30px auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="A good-sized crowd for the opening" src="/assets/image_454155.jpg" width="500" height="281"></a></p> <p>One of the main founders of the AEC (and VR) Hackathons, Damon Hernandez, was unfortunately absent – he had two very valid excuses, though: Damon was hosting a panel discussion on WebVR at <a href="http://svvr.com/conference-expo/" target="_blank">SVVR</a> and it also happened to be his birthday – and so ended up addressing the gathered attendees via Skype.</p> <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b7c8ea7c3c970b-pi" target="_blank"><img title="Livestream with Damon Hernandez who was busy at SVVR" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 30px auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="Livestream with Damon Hernandez who was busy at SVVR" src="/assets/image_862544.jpg" width="500" height="281"></a></p> <p>There were a few technical challenges getting audio to work, but hey. :-)</p> <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b7c8ea7c4a970b-pi" target="_blank"><img title="A fun moment after some technical challenges" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 30px auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="A fun moment after some technical challenges" src="/assets/image_726190.jpg" width="500" height="281"></a></p> <p>This intro was followed by a number of keynote sessions. I didn’t take many photos during these, as we were largely asked not to, but I felt entitled to take snaps of slides involving Autodesk Research.</p> <p>Someone I’ve known now for nearly a decade, <a href="http://www.zaha-hadid.com/people/shajay-bhooshan/" target="_blank">Shajay Bhooshan from Zaha Hadid Architects</a>, presented a number of projects worked on by the team I’m now in, which was really cool.</p> <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b7c8ea7c54970b-pi" target="_blank"><img title="Shajay from Zaha Hadid talking about Autodesk Research projects (digital 210 king)" style="border-left-width: 0px;

Everywhere you looked you could see people engaging on (presumably) fascinating topics.</p> <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b7c8ea7c9f970b-pi" target="_blank"><img title="Fantastic interactions everywhere you looked" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 30px auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="Fantastic interactions everywhere you looked" src="/assets/image_201680.jpg" width="500" height="281"></a></p> <p>I was tired by the end of the day on Saturday: in some ways I was relieved to be leaving, but I was mostly sad not to be there for the end. As I headed out the door towards the airport, I took a quick parting snap of Greg Howes – another co-founder of the AEC Hackathon events – talking about the Digital Fabrication Network and its members.</p> <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201bb098d9754970d-pi" target="_blank"><img title="Greg Howes talking about dFab.Net" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 30px auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="Greg Howes talking about dFab.Net" src="/assets/image_348348.jpg" width="500" height="281"></a></p> <p>This event was extremely well organised and managed, but this clearly took a lot of effort. Kudos to all those involved, especially to Autodesk’s own Philipp Mueller, who put in a massive amount of effort to make this initial, Munich-based event a success. I’m looking forward to learning more about how things went, as well as attending future AEC Hackathons whenever I get the chance!</p>
