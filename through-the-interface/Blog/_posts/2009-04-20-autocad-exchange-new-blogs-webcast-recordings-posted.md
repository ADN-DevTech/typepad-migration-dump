<p>This post is a miscellaneous update on things I’ve put off announcing because of <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/overrules/">all the fun I’ve been having with AutoCAD 2010’s Overrule API</a>.</p>  <p><a href="http://autocad.autodesk.com/"><img style="border-right-width: 0px; margin: 0px 5px 0px 20px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" title="AutoCAD Exchange" border="0" alt="AutoCAD Exchange" align="right" src="/assets/image_987097.jpg" width="120" height="103" /></a>First up is the <a href="http://autocad.autodesk.com/">AutoCAD Exchange</a>, a new site devoted to people working with, you guessed it, AutoCAD. It’s stocked with lots of useful and fun content, as well as providing social networking capabilities (be sure to add me as a contact via the <a href="http://autocad.autodesk.com/?nd=directory_add_network_friend">Networking area of the site</a>). </p>  <p><a href="http://blogs.autodesk.com/withoutanet"><img style="border-right-width: 0px; margin: 0px 5px 0px 20px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" title="Without a Net" border="0" alt="Without a Net" align="right" src="/assets/image_863042.jpg" width="121" height="105" /></a> Next is <a href="http://blogs.autodesk.com/withoutanet">Without a Net</a>, a blog hosted by an old friend of mine, Tom Stoeckel, along with esteemed colleagues Tom Bradley and Dan Scales. They will be posting regular, support-related content regarding AutoCAD to this very useful site.</p>  <p><a href="http://blogs.autodesk.com/whatamesh"><img style="border-right-width: 0px; margin: 0px 5px 0px 20px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" title="What a Mesh!" border="0" alt="What a Mesh!" align="right" src="/assets/image_372762.jpg" width="122" height="106" /></a> And last but not least (on the site round-up section of this post) is <a href="http://blogs.autodesk.com/whatamesh">What a Mesh</a>, a blog hosted by Guillermo Melantoni, the AutoCAD Product Manager responsible for driving forward the 3D capabilities of AutoCAD. And he’s managing to post in both English and Spanish.</p>  <p>[A side note: I very much like the name of this blog, but being an erstwhile <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurel_and_Hardy">Laurel and Hardy</a> fan I would probably have chosen “Another Fine Mesh”, instead. :-)]</p>  <p>Welcome to the blogosphere, Tom, Tom, Dan &amp; Guillermo!</p>  <p>And finally, I just wanted to remind people about the free webcasts and their recordings, which are available via <a href="http://www.autodesk.com/apitraining">http://www.autodesk.com/apitraining</a>, from the <a href="http://www.adskconsulting.com/adn/cs/api_course_sched.php">schedule page</a>.</p>  <p>Some items to point out:</p>  <ul>   <li>You can now download the recording of Wayne Brill’s recent webcast, <a href="http://download.autodesk.com/media/adn/AutoCAD2010APIforCUIXWebcast.zip">AutoCAD 2010 API for CUIX</a> </li>    <li>The recording of last week’s <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2009/01/free-online-training-learn-3ds-max-maya-or-motionbuilder-apis-in-just-one-hour-a-day.html">online Maya API training</a> will hopefully be posted soon, as will the recordings of the equivalent MotionBuilder and 3ds Max trainings, once completed </li>    <li>Another AutoCAD 2010 API webcast is scheduled for June 2, 2009 - “AutoCAD: Using Windows Presentation Foundation in your Applications” </li> </ul>
