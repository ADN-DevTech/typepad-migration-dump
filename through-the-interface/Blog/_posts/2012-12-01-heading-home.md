<p>I’m sitting at SFO, waiting for my flight to Heathrow to board and depart (hopefully on time, considering <a href="http://southsanfrancisco.patch.com/articles/storm-brings-rain-wind-power-outages-cancelled-flights-f25a6d67" target="_blank">the series of storms that have hit San Francisco over the last few days</a>). I was going to write something technical to post, but in the end I changed my mind: I’m going to sit back, watch some TV and have a drink.</p>  <p>Thanks for all the support and kind words I received at this year’s AU: as ever it was an incredibly interesting and rewarding experience (just speaking from a personal perspective), but it was especially important to me, this year, given my new role in the company and the fact I heard a lot of positive comments even about some of the more “out there” topics I’ve covered in recent months.</p>  <p>This kind of validation may prove to be bad news for those of you who prefer my “bread and butter” posts… consider yourselves warned. ;-)</p>
