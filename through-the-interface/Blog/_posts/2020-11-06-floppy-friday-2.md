<p>With all the stress and anxiety in the world at the moment, it’s nice to unwind with an old school video game. In this week’s Floppy Friday we take a quick look at a couple of games – <a href="https://www.c64-wiki.com/wiki/Nibbly_%2792" target="_blank">Nibbly ‘92</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_Bobble" target="_blank">Bubble Bobble</a>. I used to play Bubble Bobble back in the day on my ZX Spectrum, but whatever skillz I may have once had have totally disappeared, as you’ll see. If you want to check out the previous episode, <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2020/10/floppy-friday-1.html" target="_blank">here it is</a>. I’ve also created a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMPZ0Qz6RKGpOJuHbVY5aVYQntaDEMXZp" target="_blank">playlist</a>, in case you want to use you want to use it to watch future episodes as they come out.</p><p>I changed a few things, this time, in that I managed to set up a tripod holding my phone which allows a much better camera angle. I probably need to work on some of the screen colours – probably due to the lighting – but we’ll see about that next time. I also decided to show one “known” floppy (that I’d uncovered beforehand) and then one random one. In reality, though, I ended up going through a few randos before finding one that was playable. I decided to edit out the dull bits, as we already saw too many non-playable games last week.</p><p align="center"><br></p><p align="center"><iframe width="500" height="283" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/pFmfcbVN0gY" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"></iframe></p><p align="center"></p><p><br></p><p>If you’ve had fun watching this video – or have suggestions on how to make the series more interesting – then please let me know. I’ll be back next week with the ramp-up to Autodesk University 2020.</p>
