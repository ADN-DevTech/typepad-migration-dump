<p>Cyrille Fauvel, our DevTech M&amp;E manager, tells me that the API wishlist surveys for our Media &amp; Entertainment products are now live:</p>  <p><a href="http://www.zoomerang.com/Survey/?p=WEB229GZSYNBPL">Autodesk® Maya®</a>    <br /><a href="http://www.zoomerang.com/Survey/?p=WEB229GZTHNBZY">Autodesk® 3ds Max®</a>    <br /><a href="http://www.zoomerang.com/Survey/?p=WEB229GZTKNC37">Autodesk® MotionBuilder®</a>    <br /><a href="http://www.zoomerang.com/Survey/?p=WEB229GZTSNC7G">Autodesk® FBX®</a> </p>  <p>The surveys will stay live until <strong>September 15th, 2009</strong>. </p>  <p>They complement the <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2009/07/api-wishlist-surveys-for-autodesk-products.html">API wishlist surveys for our “CAD” products</a>, which are still live at the time of writing (the deadline has passed, but I’ll wait until Monday before closing them out and sending the results to the appropriate Product Management staff). Just in case there are stragglers out there who would still like to fill one of them out.&#160; :-)</p>  <p>Once again, these surveys provide extremely valuable information to our Engineering teams, so a big thank you to anyone who takes the time to complete one or more of them.</p>
