<p>We arrived in the Cape on New Year’s Day. Leaving Swellendam we stopped by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robertson,_Western_Cape" target="_blank">Robertson</a> to see the house in which my wife’s grandmother grew up. A nice bit of family nostalgia. We then decided to swing by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franschhoek" target="_blank">Franschhoek</a> for a quick visit… on the way we passed by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theewaterskloof_Dam" target="_blank">Theewaterskloof Dam</a>: one of the main reservoirs supplying the Cape.<a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201bb09e5608a970d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="The Theewaterkloofs dam" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="The Theewaterkloofs dam" src="/assets/image_575982.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>It was depressingly empty: the Cape has been suffering a multi-year drought, to the point that they currently have <a href="https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/level-6-water-restrictions-for-cape-town-from-january-how-will-it-work-20171228" target="_blank">level 6 water restrictions in place</a>.</p><p>To get to Franschhoek we headed across the lovely Franschhoek Pass.</p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b7c94236c1970b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="217" title="The Franschhoek Pass" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="The Franschhoek Pass" src="/assets/image_735813.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Franschhoek is a gorgeous little town I stumbled across in 1996 during my first visit to the region. It was exactly the wrong place to visit on January 1st, though: the town was absolutely heaving with people. We quickly decided to drive onwards to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellenbosch" target="_blank">Stellenbosch</a>, which proved to be virtually empty: it’s fundamentally a University town and so gets nice and quiet when the students are home for the summer.</p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b8d2cc84f1970c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Stellenbosch" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Stellenbosch" src="/assets/image_831024.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>After a late lunch we had enough time to visit the beautiful botanical gardens before they closed.</p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b8d2cc84f5970c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Lily pads" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Lily pads" src="/assets/image_320237.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b7c9423707970b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Big lily pads" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Big lily pads" src="/assets/image_402977.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>From Stellenbosch we headed towards <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somerset_West" target="_blank">Somerset West</a>, where we stayed with family for the remainder of our time in South Africa. It’s around 45 minutes from there to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Town" target="_blank">Cape Town</a>, so a perfect base for visiting the city.</p><p>As we were a little early getting to the area, we went straight down to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strand,_Western_Cape" target="_blank">Strand</a> beach. It was quite the experience – on New Year’s Day (and January 2nd, too, apparently) it’s completely full of people.</p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201bb09e560de970d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="On Strand Beach" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="On Strand Beach" src="/assets/image_924466.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b7c942370f970b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="New Year's Day is busy" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="New Year's Day is busy" src="/assets/image_865300.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b8d2cc8502970c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="People singing and dancing in the water" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="People singing and dancing in the water" src="/assets/image_42362.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>We had two full days to enjoy Cape Town. The first day, January 2nd, was the day of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaapse_Klopse" target="_blank">Kaapse Klopse</a> – or the Minstrels Festival – in Cape Town.</p><p>On the way in we saw some cows crossing the motorway. Luckily they chose to use the overhead crossing.</p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b8d2cc8936970c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="498" height="376" title="Cows crossing the motorway" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Cows crossing the motorway" src="/assets/image_602507.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>We arrived early to make sure could find parking at the Waterfront and walk back into town for the parade. It was due to start at noon, but by 2:30pm we decided to bail: we didn’t have that much time in Cape Town and the kids were getting hungry. The festival is known for its late start, apparently… it seems even some of the performers struggled to know where to go.</p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b8d2cc888b970c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="499" height="375" title="Minstrels crossing" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Minstrels crossing" src="/assets/image_510004.jpg" border="0"></a><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b7c9423b5e970b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="499" height="375" title="They seemed a little lost" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="They seemed a little lost" src="/assets/image_217222.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>We headed back to the Waterfront for a bite and to shop for gifts for friends and family.</p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b7c9423b63970b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="The Victoria and Albert Waterfront" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="The Victoria and Albert Waterfront" src="/assets/image_801836.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Yesterday we decided to take the kids to the top of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_Mountain" target="_blank">Table Mountain</a>. It’s a busy time of year, so getting there early is a good idea. We didn’t, so were told we’d have to wait 2 hours to get the cable car up. We rolled the dice and waited… in the end it took a little over an hour before getting to the front of the queue.</p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b7c9423b71970b-pi"><img width="376" height="500" title="The cable car arriving" style="margin: 30px auto; float: none; display: block;" alt="The cable car arriving" src="/assets/image_882762.jpg"></a></p><p>The ride up – in the <a href="http://www.tablemountain.net/blog/entry/table_mountain_cable_cars_eight_amazing_facts/" target="_blank">Swiss-made cable car, apparently</a> – was nice. The car had a rotating base, which allowed people to get a varied view of the surroundings on the way up.</p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b8d2cc88b2970c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="On the way to the top" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="On the way to the top" src="/assets/image_357754.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>At the top the view was incredible – the conditions were absolutely perfect.</p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201bb09e564b6970d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="124" title="A panoramic view" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="A panoramic view" src="/assets/image_379552.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>There was plenty of interesting flora and fauna. We saw a fun little lizard, bouncing up and down on a rock.</p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b8d2cc88da970c-pi"><img width="500" height="281" title="A bouncing lizard" style="margin: 30px auto; float: none; display: block;" alt="A bouncing lizard" src="/assets/image_402118.jpg"></a></p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b7c9423c55970b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Flowers on Table Mountain" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Flowers on Table Mountain" src="/assets/image_711226.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>We did have to queue for the cable car back down, of course, but at least the view from the queue was spectacular.</p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201bb09e564d5970d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="141" title="Pictures from the queue for the way down" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Pictures from the queue for the way down" src="/assets/image_191612.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>That’s it for our South African leg, and for the trip as a whole. Here’s the route we took across from Swellendam to Somerset West:</p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b8d2cc8517970c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="194" title="The route to the Cape" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="The route to the Cape" src="/assets/image_143644.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Here’s how the route looks from Lesotho, as that’s the last time I posted one:</p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201bb09e560fd970d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="283" title="Lestho to Cape Town" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Lestho to Cape Town" src="/assets/image_728002.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Today we fly back with a heavy heart. It’s really been an incredible 6-month trip… we’ve seen our children grow – and not just physically – over the time we’ve been away with them. I’m so happy we had the chance to do this… I’ll probably publish a wrap-up with links to the various posts over the last 6 months. To finish, here are a couple of photos we published to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/monde_en_poche/" target="_blank">our Instagram feed</a> – one is the “best 9 of 2017” (chosen by us, not based on popularity).</p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b7c9423cb4970b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="500" title="Best 9" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Best 9" src="/assets/image_306852.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>The second is our “Happy New Year” photo, courtesy of <a href="https://prisma-ai.com/" target="_blank">Prisma</a>.</p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b8d2cc89b2970c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="500" title="Happy New Year" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Happy New Year" src="/assets/image_937163.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Thanks for following along over the last 6 months. This blog’s normal operation will start again shortly, for those of you who didn’t. ;-)</p>
