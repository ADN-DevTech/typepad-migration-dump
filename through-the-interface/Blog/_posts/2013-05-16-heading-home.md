<p>I’m at Changi airport, about to board my Swiss flight for Zurich. I had a great few days, here in Singapore, culminating in a presentation on integrating Kinect Fusion and Leap Motion with AutoCAD for members of the various engineering teams here. It was a lot of fun.</p>  <p>Anyway, I’m heading home, now. I think I’ve set the record for my longest stay in Singapore without having participated in one of the major national pass-times (shopping), although I certainly participated heavily in the other (eating).</p>  <p>Here’s a quick shot from the top of the Marin Bay Sands, the hotel I pictured in <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2013/05/in-singapore.html" target="_blank">the last post</a>, out towards the sea (yes, those are moored cargo containers out there – pretty cool).</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201901c3f6cd4970b-pi" target="_blank"><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 20px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="View from the Marina Bay Sands deck" border="0" alt="View from the Marina Bay Sands deck" src="/assets/image_170340.jpg" width="480" height="364" /></a></p>
