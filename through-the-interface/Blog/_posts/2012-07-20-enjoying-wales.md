<p>After a great week in Brittany, we took <a href="http://www.brittany-ferries.co.uk/ferry-routes/ferries-france/plymouth-roscoff" target="_blank">an overnight, cross-channel ferry from Roscoff to Plymouth</a> to begin our fortnight in the UK. <a href="http://www.brittany-ferries.co.uk/fleet/cruise-ferries/armorique" target="_blank">The ferry</a> was a pleasant surprise – far removed from the Dover to Calais “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booze_cruise" target="_blank">booze cruises</a>” I remember from my student days. We had a cabin with a window and breakfast delivered an hour before arrival. All very civilised.</p>  <p>On arrival, we headed on up through Devon and Somerset, stopping in Glastonbury for an early morning visit to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glastonbury_Tor" target="_blank">the Tor</a>. We then decided – somewhat on the spur of the moment, as it was a bit out of the way – to head across to Wiltshire to make a quick visit to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stonehenge" target="_blank">Stonehenge</a> before heading back across to spend the night with family in Cardiff.</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201761693f6fe970c-pi" target="_blank"><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 20px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="Stonehenge" border="0" alt="Stonehenge" src="/assets/image_941718.jpg" width="474" height="317" /></a></p>  <p>The weather wasn’t great for our second day in the UK, so we made the most of the opportunity to visit Cardiff’s <a href="http://www.techniquest.org" target="_blank">Techniquest</a>: a science centre I’d rate up there (and in some ways beyond) San Francisco’s <a href="http://www.exploratorium.edu" target="_blank">Exploratorium</a> and Switzerland’s <a href="http://www.technorama.ch/en" target="_blank">Technorama</a> (other such centres we’ve been to elsewhere).</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201774379f534970d-pi" target="_blank"><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 20px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="Techniquest" border="0" alt="Techniquest" src="/assets/image_502521.jpg" width="474" height="317" /></a></p>  <p>I’m writing this from <a href="http://www.furzehillfarm.com" target="_blank">a charming B&amp;B</a> – which is a working horse farm – in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pembrokeshire" target="_blank">Pembrokeshire</a> (in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Wales" target="_blank">West Wales</a>). We’re here for a couple of nights before heading back via Cardiff to spend some time in England before heading south towards Switzerland (this time via the tunnel from Folkestone).</p>
