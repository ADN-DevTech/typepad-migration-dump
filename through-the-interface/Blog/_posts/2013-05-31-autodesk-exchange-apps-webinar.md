<p>The ADN team has <a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/autocad/2013/05/webinar-announcement.html" target="_blank">announced a free webinar</a> (and free to all, not just to ADN members) on <em>“How developers can ride and profit from the adoption wave of Autodesk Exchange Apps”, </em>being held on <strong>June 13th, 2013</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201901cbf6f65970b-pi" target="_blank"><img align="right" alt="Not that kind of Apple Store" border="0" height="152" src="/assets/image_310127.jpg" style="background-image: none; margin: 0px 0px 10px 20px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; float: right; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="Not that kind of Apple Store" width="226" /></a>We’ve all seen how mobile-focused marketplaces such as Apple’s App Store and Google Play have revolutionised the way we find and use apps on these platforms. Apple and Microsoft have provided stores for users of their desktop operating systems to find apps that work there, too.</p>
<p>As a large application vendor with a vibrant development community, we see an opportunity to serve our customers better by making it really easy for them to find apps our developers provide to meet their specific business needs. That’s what Autodesk Exchange Apps stores are all about.</p>
<p>There are now 15 Autodesk Exchange Apps stores for our various platform products, with over a million visits and 250,000 downloads during the last year.</p>
<p>Sign up for the webinar to find out how you can take advantage of this infrastructure to get your own apps in the hands of customers.</p>
