<p>Our Technology Centers team has posted <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/autodesk-technology-center-request-proposal-mixed-reality-sahota" target="_blank">an interesting RFP on LinkedIn</a>: they’ve been working with Microsoft to make <a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/mixed-reality/" target="_blank">HoloLens 2 headsets</a> available to Technology Center residents interested in exploring mixed reality workflows for the AEC and Manufacturing industries.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2026be406db1d200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="281" title="HoloLens 2" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="HoloLens 2" src="/assets/image_488798.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>It seems pretty straightforward: if you’re interested in developing a mixed reality solution – whether using Unity, Unreal or WebXR – then you need to <a href="https://airtable.com/shrlYgIo1uYRBWzDJ" target="_blank">submit your proposal</a> before <strong>August 24th, 2020</strong>. If accepted you’ll be invited into <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/technology-centers/residency" target="_blank">our residency program</a> and provided a HoloLens 2 device for 6 months (with the possibility of extending the term, if needed).</p><p>This seems like a really interesting opportunity, not only in terms of getting access to hardware but also for the collaborative opportunities afforded by participation in the Technology Center residency program. If you’re interested in exploring the possibilities for XR in AEC or Manufacturing, apply today!</p>
