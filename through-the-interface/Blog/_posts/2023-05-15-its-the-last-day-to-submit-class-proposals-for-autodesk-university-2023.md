<p>The <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2023/04/submit-your-class-proposal-for-autodesk-university-2023-today.html" target="_blank">CFP period</a> for this year’s AU has simply flown by – mainly because it’s turned out to be a busy period between <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2023/04/50.html" target="_blank">personal milestones</a> and <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2023/05/techx-2023-in-dallas.html" target="_blank">work travel</a> – and today (May 15th) is the last day to submit your proposals for the event.</p><p>Over the weekend I went ahead and finalised last-minute changes to mine and clicked submit.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202b7518089f2200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="411" title="My AU 2023 class proposals" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="My AU 2023 class proposals" src="/assets/image_446320.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>The titles (as shown above) are:</p><ul><li><strong>Monitoring and visualizing data from the MX3D and Dar Smart Bridges</strong></li><li><strong>Channeling Minecraft to analyze architectural spaces with VASA and Dynamo</strong></li></ul><p>Both are variations on proposals I submitted for last year’s event (but obviously weren’t selected), so I’m hoping the additional time and energy I’ve put into crafting this year’s versions pays dividends. We shall see.</p><p>There’s a fun tab in the “My AU” page that lists the classes you’ve taught, over the years, going back to 2013. My list contains a few I’d forgotten about (mainly classes I was involved in as a panelist or co-speaker). I’d love to see the list going back to the year 2000 (I think my that was probably my first AU), but it’s still nostalgic to see the list from the last decade.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202b68537856a200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="469" title="My AU classes since 2013" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="My AU classes since 2013" src="/assets/image_860662.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>I assume you have until midnight (Pacific time) tonight to submit your proposals, but I suggest getting them in as soon as you can.</p>
