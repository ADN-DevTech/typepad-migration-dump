<p>I’ve talked a little about the <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2017/02/we-are-furnished.html" target="_blank">VR room we have at Autodesk in Neuchatel</a>. Our colleagues in Munich have been building something similar, yet on a <u>totally</u> different level: they’ve just officially opened their “VR Center of Excellence”.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201bb098877ff970d-pi" target="_blank"><img title="VR Center of Excellence at Autodesk Munich" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 30px auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="VR Center of Excellence at Autodesk Munich" src="/assets/image_962603.jpg" width="500" height="140"></a></p> <p>And excellent it truly is – check out this video to see for yourself:</p> <p align="center">&nbsp;</p> <p align="center"><iframe height="281" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/E5H3c1euX9o?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0?ecver=1" frameborder="0" width="500" allowfullscreen></iframe></p> <p align="center">&nbsp;</p> <p>A lot of what you might assume is post-production in the above video was actually performed in real-time. And at 4K resolution, too! Extremely impressive stuff.</p> <p>I really like what the Munich team has done. I’m hoping I’ll get the chance to poke my nose in on Friday, <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2017/03/aec-hackathon-is-coming-to-munich-and-so-am-i.html" target="_blank">before the AEC Hackathon kicks off</a>. We’ll see if I get the chance.</p> <p>Going from the video, the experience appears way above and beyond what I’d typically demo in the Neuchatel office: our take is more from the perspective that VR isn’t all that hard, these days – you can get a very decent VR setup for a little over $3K, for instance – and that it’s something that can deliver significant benefits even for smaller companies, whether for collaboration or customer communication. But I’m glad that someone is taking a different tack and has taken the time to create such a “blow your socks off” VR experience. If I get the chance to take it for a spin on Friday’s trip, I’ll be sure to post something about it next week.</p>
