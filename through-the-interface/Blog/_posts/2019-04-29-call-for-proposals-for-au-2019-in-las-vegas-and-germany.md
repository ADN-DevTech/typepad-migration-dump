<p>Today the <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/autodesk-university/blog/AU-Las-Vegas-2019-Call-Proposals-Opens-April-30-2019" target="_blank">call for proposals opens for AU 2019</a> – and <a href="https://forge.autodesk.com/devcon-2019#call-for-proposals" target="_blank">its accompanying Forge DevCon</a> – in Las Vegas. I was informed of this fact by an email which very creepily contained a photo of me describing something or other with my hands.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a45890a0200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="187" title="Me looking intense" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Me looking intense" src="/assets/image_697019.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>(<a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com" target="_blank">Jeremy Tammik</a> speculated that I was once again <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2019/04/the-living-vs-the-dead-using-generative-urban-design-to-prepare-for-the-zombie-apocalypse.html" target="_blank">talking about zombies</a>. :-)</p><p>As one door opens, another one closes: this is also the last day you can submit classes for AU Germany and the Forge DevCon in Darmstadt. It’s important to note that AU Germany is a German-language event, while its DevCon is in English.</p><p>Here are the dates for the various events:</p><ul><li>Germany</li><ul><li>Forge DevCon</li><ul><li>October 14, 2019</li></ul><li>Autodesk University</li><ul><li>October 15-16, 2019</li></ul></ul><li>Las Vegas</li><ul><li>Forge DevCon | Connect &amp; Construct</li><ul><li>November 18, 2019</li></ul><li>Autodesk University</li><ul><li>November 19-21, 2019</li></ul></ul></ul><p>I haven’t yet thought through what I’m going to submit for either AU 2019 or the Forge DevCon (at this stage the Las Vegas events, I’m likely not to be presenting anything in Darmstadt, this year).</p><p>I suspect there’ll be at least something about using the Space Analysis package for Dynamo to implement Generative Design workflows using Refinery, with a particular focus on the Campus Layout example (for urban planning) and Project Rediscover (for architecture). I may also submit something related to Forge, but we’ll see.</p><p>Either way I have to put my thinking hat on, as the clock is now ticking towards the <strong>May 28 submission deadline</strong>. <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/autodesk-university/conference/las-vegas/call-for-proposals" target="_blank">You can submit your own class proposals here</a>.</p>
