<p>A new version of the AutoCAD .NET Wizard – compatible with AutoCAD 2011 and with Visual Studio 2010 – has been posted to <a href="http://autodesk.com/developautocad">the AutoCAD Developer Center</a> (and you can also get it from <a href="http://images.autodesk.com/adsk/files/dotnetwizard_v10_0_4_0.zip">this direct link (8.74 MB)</a>).</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20134863e6542970c-pi"><img style="border-right-width: 0px; margin: 20px 10px 20px 20px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" title="Using the AutoCAD .NET Wizard" border="0" alt="Using the AutoCAD .NET Wizard" align="right" src="/assets/image_270002.jpg" width="254" height="204" /></a>The download size has jumped from a little under a megabyte its current size: this is due to a very helpful screencast recorded by Stephen Preston and included in the Wizard’s distribution.</p>  <p>If you’ve been using prior versions of this Wizard – or are just interested in its capabilities – be sure to check it out!</p>
