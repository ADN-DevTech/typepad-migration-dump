<p>I’m at Zurich airport, waiting for my flight to Frankfurt, from where I’ll head onwards to Toronto. (The way over has a stop as the daily direct flight leaves too early for me to comfortably take… at least I can take the direct flight home – a red-eye – on Friday night.)</p><p>The main purpose for this trip is a team offsite on Thursday, but I’ll be spending as much time as I can on Wednesday and Friday working with my Toronto-based colleagues. There are a few <a href="http://dasher360.com" target="_blank">Dasher 360</a>-related tasks I need to move forward, while I’m there, and I’m looking forward to doing a deep (if quick) dive into the <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2019/02/interested-in-space-analysis-for-dynamo-and-refinery.html" target="_blank">path-finding</a> <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2019/02/building-buzz.html" target="_blank">work</a> Rhys and Simon are immersed in. So a whirlwind trip – I have to be back for next week’s Forge Accelerator in Dublin – but I’m expecting it to be very worthwhile. A worthwhile whirlwind trip, in fact. :-)</p><p>Anyway, here’s a photo of this sunny late-Winter’s day in Zurich:</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a441f0b9200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Planes" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Planes" src="/assets/image_62990.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>And here’s a quick photo that makes me a) sigh and b) optimistic that we’ll still have jobs once the robots take over.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a48fb527200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Airport bluescreen" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Airport bluescreen" src="/assets/image_357775.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>I’ll no doubt be posting an update, later this week, once I’ve had the chance to connect with the team in Toronto.</p>
