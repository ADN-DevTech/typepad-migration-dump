<p>This year’s API wishlist surveys for AutoCAD Civil 3D, Inventor, Navisworks and Revit are now live:</p>  <ul>   <li><a href="http://www.zoomerang.com/Survey/WEB22FSEYSMJ86" target="_blank">AutoCAD Civil 3D</a></li>    <li><a href="http://www.zoomerang.com/Survey/WEB22FVZCJTCQN" target="_blank">Autodesk Inventor</a></li>    <li><a href="http://www.zoomerang.com/Survey/WEB22FRMLV62H3" target="_blank">Autodesk Navisworks</a></li>    <li><a href="http://www.zoomerang.com/Survey/WEB22FR9A8WHJ9" target="_blank">Autodesk Revit</a></li> </ul>  <p>Our Engineering teams use the results from these surveys to help steer their ongoing API development priorities, release on release. If you have feedback or specific requests regarding our APIs, this is a great way to get them in front of the right people inside Autodesk.</p>  <p>I’d been holding off posting these links – with the hope I could also include AutoCAD’s – but as the deadline is here it seems prudent not to delay any further. And when I say “here”, the initial deadline for completing these surveys is <strong>today</strong> – June 11th, 2012 – so if you’re interested in providing us with feedback, please don’t procrastinate: while I expect they’ll remain open a little longer, the deadline probably won’t be extended by very much.</p>  <p>And I will, of course, post the survey link for AutoCAD, once it’s available.</p>
