<p>On Monday afternoon I received a message from my friend Sven Amiet asking whether I&#39;d be going to Swissbau 2024. I had some sense it was happening this year (it happens every other one), but I hadn&#39;t realised it was this week already.</p>
<p>In any case I checked my meeting schedule - and found that I didn&#39;t have anything important - and decided to head across to Basel on Tuesday morning.<a href="/assets/image_924950.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Basel train station" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_924950.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Basel train station" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>It’s always impressive to arrive at Basel’s Messeplatz by tram. The last time I’d been here was for <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2020/01/swissbau-2020.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Swissbau 2020</a> (I skipped the one held 2 years ago).</p>

<p><a href="/assets/image_319356.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="It s a sign" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_319356.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="It&#39;s a sign" width="500" /></a>Once inside I quickly got my bearings by climbing some stairs.<a href="/assets/image_863587.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="From above" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_863587.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="From above" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>It’s a trade show, after all, but the odd plant pot did help soften the atmosphere.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_818170.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Access to nature" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_818170.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Access to nature" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>I’m a sucker for a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMC_DeLorean" rel="noopener" target="_blank">DeLorean</a>, like most people my age (I suspect).</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_394473.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Back to the Future" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_394473.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Back to the Future" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>I had no idea what it was doing on the show floor, mind.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_870786.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Side" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_870786.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Side" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>From searching the web, it seems to be an art exhibit by <a href="https://benibischof.ch/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Beni Bischof</a> that&#39;s <a href="https://www.swissbau.ch/de/c/zeitmaschine-holz.44806" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a statement about humanity&#39;s impact on the planet</a>.<a href="/assets/image_588802.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Front" border="0" height="500" src="/assets/image_588802.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Front" width="375" /></a>I hadn’t made much by way of plans, but wandering around the Swissbau Lab area I soon bumped into Nora and Andres, friends from <a href="https://pazacademy.ch/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PAZ Academy</a> in Zurich.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_217908.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="With Nora and Andres from PAZ Academy" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_217908.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="With Nora and Andres from PAZ Academy" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>From there I headed to the Mensch ünd Maschine stand: MüM are our platinum reseller in Switzerland, so I knew I’d find some familiar faces there.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_470376.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="The MuM stand" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_470376.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="The MuM stand" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Marcel Ludwig was busy demonstrating various technology solutions to visitors.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_258921.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Marcel being kept busy" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_258921.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Marcel being kept busy" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>I was intrigued by the physical model on display.<a href="/assets/image_224695.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="The physical twin" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_224695.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="The physical twin" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Its creator, Pietro Nobel, stepped me through the project.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_362271.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Pietro with his project" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_362271.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Pietro with his project" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>He’d filled it with sensors that were capturing data to be displayed in Autodesk Tandem.<a href="/assets/image_66593.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Disassembling" border="0" height="500" src="/assets/image_66593.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Disassembling" width="375" /></a></p>
<p>It&#39;s always awesome to see data showing up in Tandem. When I was here four years ago the focus had been on Project Dasher, and it&#39;s great to see how this technology is continually evolving and now hitting the mainstream.<a href="/assets/image_777490.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Twins" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_777490.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Twins" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Marcel showed me some XR-based solutions. He’s excited too see the impact of Autodesk Workshop XR as it becomes more mature and ready for widespread adoption.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_263581.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Marcel in VR" border="0" height="500" src="/assets/image_263581.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Marcel in VR" width="375" /></a></p>
<p>And yes, we had some fun reviewing designs together in VR.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_665562.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="With Marcel" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_665562.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="With Marcel" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>It was also very nice to catch up with Reto Largo from NEST, who was passing by the MüM stand while I was there.<a href="/assets/image_543222.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Catching up with Reto Largo" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_543222.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Catching up with Reto Largo" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Towards the end of the afternoon I headed back down to the Swissbau Focus area.<a href="/assets/image_51581.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="The Lab area" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_51581.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="The Lab area" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>There were a number of presentations happening here throughout the day - all in German, so I didn’t pay very much attention, I admit - including the awards ceremony for <a href="https://www.sia.ch/en/the-sia/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the Swiss Society of Engineers and Architects (SIA)</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_831574.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Talks" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_831574.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Talks" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>I finally had some time to chat properly with Sven - who had triggered the whole visit - over a glass of wine at the <a href="https://crb.ch" rel="noopener" target="_blank">CRB</a> stand.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_259288.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Apero time with Sven" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_259288.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Apero time with Sven" width="500" /></a>It was a nice way to end a very pleasant visit to this year’s Swissbau event. Thanks for the prompt, Sven!</p>
