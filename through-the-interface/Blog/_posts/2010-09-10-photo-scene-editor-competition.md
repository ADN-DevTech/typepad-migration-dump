<p>I’ve talked about the Photo Scene Editor tool a few times (<a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2010/07/photo-scene-editor-on-autodesk-labs.html" target="_blank">on</a> <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2010/08/importing-the-output-from-photofly-via-the-photo-scene-editor-into-autocad.html" target="_blank">this</a> <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2010/08/capturing-a-point-cloud-of-a-monument-using-photosynth.html" target="_blank">blog</a> and in <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2010/07/adn-devcast-episode-4-using-photofly-and-photosynth-with-autocad-2011.html" target="_blank">a DevCast</a>), so hopefully you’re already familiar with the capabilities of this fun product. This is really just to let you know that the Autodesk Labs team is <a href="http://labs.blogs.com/its_alive_in_the_lab/2010/08/photo-scene-contest.html" target="_blank">running a competition</a> that ends in a couple of weeks, on <strong>September 24th.</strong></p>
<p>Give it a try, and have the chance to win a signed (by Autodesk CEO, Carl Bass) copy of 3ds Max or 3ds Max Design <strong>plus</strong> a 64GB iPad!</p>
