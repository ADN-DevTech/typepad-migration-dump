The event starts at 10am in Brasilia, which is 2pm in Central Europe, so the timing should work well for Asia, Europe and early birds on the east coast of North America, too.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202788067be8c200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="500" title="BIM Forum Brasil" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="BIM Forum Brasil" src="/assets/image_71841.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>I’ll be sharing information on our older projects, as usual, but I’m also planning to showcase some of our more recent (previously unseen) projects. So there’s likely to be new information even for people who have seen me talk on this topic before. Here’s a quick teaser animation showing some new content I’ll be covering in my presentation.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202788067be94200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="312" title="The Dar bridge in Dasher" style="margin: 30px auto; float: none; display: block;" alt="The Dar bridge in Dasher" src="/assets/image_829927.jpg"></a></p><p>If you’re interested in joining, please go ahead and <a href="https://www.autodesk.com.br/webinars/aec/digital-twins?mktvar002=4774014%7CPDS%7CLI_GDG_AEC-Collection_AMER_BR_Visits_0056_4774014_Webinar-Digital-Twin-LA_KAH" target="_blank">sign up here</a>. I’ll be presenting in English, so those not fluent in Portuguese can still attend, although as there are some very interesting speakers who I expect will be presenting in Portuguese, you’ll definitely get more out of it if you understand the language.</p>
