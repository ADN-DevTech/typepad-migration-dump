<p>Some good news for people who thought they’d missed their chance to speak at this year’s Autodesk University in London: the Call For Proposals (CFP) for AU London 2019 has been extended until<strong> January 25th, 2019</strong>.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad38e1d9e200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="259" title="AU London CFP extended" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="AU London CFP extended" src="/assets/image_918526.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>I love Autodesk University events in general, but the London edition – which I attended for the first time in 2018 – is quickly becoming my favourite, venue-wise.</p><p>Tobacco Dock is a fabulous place to hold an event, providing the weather gods are smiling. (Last year’s event was basically perfect, while the inaugural event in 2017 was <em>very</em> hot, apparently… and I can only imagine what it would be like if it rained: part of the venue’s charm is that it’s open to the elements, but it’s also true that what’s charming can quickly become irritating.)</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad3d3cee9200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="AU London at Tobacco Dock" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="AU London at Tobacco Dock" src="/assets/image_165626.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Anyway, as I really want to come back across to AU London 2019, I went and submitted two classes for this year’s edition. I’ve submitted both alongside awesome co-speakers, so I hope that one or the other will get accepted.</p><p>Here are the proposal abstracts. The first is a session about the project we’ve been working on with MX3D in the Netherlands, and would be presented with my esteemed colleague Alex Tessier:</p><blockquote><p><strong>MX3D: using Autodesk technology to enable the next generation of smart infrastructure</strong></p>
<p>MX3D, a Dutch startup, has been building the world's first robotically-printed steel bridge in Amsterdam. Autodesk was involved from an early stage: initially around Generative Design - a process MX3D ended up not using to design the bridge - and later to help add "smarts" to the bridge via an integrated sensor network and associated technology. This session takes a look at this fascinating project, discussing some of the technological and sociological issues faced when placing a piece of smart infrastructure - one that can report on its surroundings and how it is used - in the middle of Amsterdam's red-light district.</p>
</blockquote><p>The second relates to Generative Design, and would be presented with the brilliant Lorenzo Villaggi from The Living:</p><blockquote><p><strong>How Autodesk Research uses Project Refinery to deliver Generative Design workflows for AEC</strong></p>
<p>Autodesk Research’s in-house architectural studio, The Living, is a pioneer in the application of Generative Design technology. They have completed successful projects for a number of customers who have been featured on the AU mainstage in recent years - such as Airbus, Van Wijnen and Daiwa House - as well as for Autodesk itself. In this session we'll take a look at projects delivered by The Living, and see how they are using Dynamo with the Refinery optimization engine to implement Generative Design workflows for the AEC industry at a variety of scales.</p></blockquote><p>Even if neither proposal ends up getting accepted I’ll be doing my best to get across to London for the event on June 18-19, 2019. If you manage to get your own proposals submitted by the end of this week then perhaps I’ll see you there!</p>
