<p>Just out of curiosity, this morning I decided to go and check the <a href="https://youtu.be/gUxdhAdY0Bo?list=PLMPZ0Qz6RKGqhrrLKOLebfE-AzcJUPtsb" target="_blank">YouTube video</a> we saw in <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2016/08/making-our-hololens-robot-dance.html" target="_blank">the last post</a>. I’d realised from my messing around with the <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2015/12/the-force-awakens-in-autocad.html" target="_blank">Star Wars opening crawl</a> that if you include copyrighted content in a video, then sometimes ads get included, too, with the proceeds benefiting the copyright owner. Which is absolutely fair enough, as far as I’m concerned.</p> <p>What I hadn’t realised is that some copyrighted content isn’t viewable in certain countries, presumably at the request of the copyright owner. So due to its use of a Chemical Brothers track, my last video may not have been viewable in Germany, a place where there happens to be a whole load of robotics and advanced manufacturing enthusiasts.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b7c8873fcf970b-pi" target="_blank"><img title="Blocked in Germany" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 30px auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="Blocked in Germany" src="/assets/image_162237.jpg" width="500" height="360"></a></p> <p>I couldn’t have that, so I went ahead and recorded a new version of the video, this time with <a href="https://youtu.be/ub747pprmJ8" target="_blank">a song that’s viewable worldwide</a>. Incidentally, if you’re using copyrighted tracks in your own videos, you can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/music_policies" target="_blank">check here</a> whether a song is restricted regionally.</p> <p>Here’s our robot dancing again inside HoloLens, this time for the viewing pleasure of our friends in Germany. Enjoy!</p> <p align="center">&nbsp;</p> <p align="center"><iframe height="281" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/kO2toZcsevI?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" width="500" allowfullscreen></iframe></p> <p align="center">&nbsp; <p>By the way, I just received a congratulations via LinkedIn for my 21st anniversary at Autodesk. I don't fully believe it's true – I suspect there must have been some kind of malfunction in the way LinkedIn calculates these things – because I don’t really know where the time has gone. The next big milestone (if I make it that far) will be in a couple of years when I hit the “half my life at Autodesk” point. Gulp.</p> <p><strong><em>Update:</em></strong></p> <p>It turns out there’s a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blocking_of_YouTube_videos_in_Germany" target="_blank">reason certain YouTube music videos are blocked in Germany</a>. Mystery solved!</p>
