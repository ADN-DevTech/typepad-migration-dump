<p>On Tuesday and Wednesday we went scuba diving. Our son, Kalan, went both days: I accompanied him on Tuesday and my wife went on Wednesday. (Kalan is really passionate about diving, which goes along with his desire to become a marine biologist when he’s older.) Kalan has cut his teeth diving in Lake Neuchatel – where visibility on a good day is a few metres – so this was a great opportunity for him.</p><p>I’m personally not such a huge fan of diving: I do enjoy it, but I’m really a landlubber at heart. This was a really enjoyable dive, though: we started out seeing a sea turtle (never a bad start) and then travelled around a ravine of coral, appreciating the various reef fish for 47 minutes. Not a deep dive – Kalan has his junior Open Water, but as he’s 13 he’s limited to around 18m – but really beautiful.</p><p>Our divemaster, Stephane, (from the excellent <a href="http://www.mooreabluediving.com/" target="_blank">Moorea Blue Diving Center</a>) mentioned that UC Berkeley has a research station on the island, the <a href="http://www.moorea.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Richard B. Gump South Pacific Research Station</a> (or Gump Station, for short). When we got back to the house I fired off a quick, speculative email to see whether a budding marine biologist might be able to get a tour of the facility. We were really lucky: the administrative director of the facility, Mrs. Hinano Murphy, responded first thing in the morning to say we could swing by at 9am. Kalan’s next dive wasn’t until 12:30pm, so this was perfect. It was a 20-minute drive around the coast of Mo’orea (you can get around the whole island in about an hour and a quarter, give or take), and we found the place fairly easily.</p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b8d2b3d6e9970c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Stunning views" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Stunning views" src="/assets/image_952596.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>It’s a discreet facility – there were no signs to help find it, for instance – and it does some interesting work. </p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b8d2b3d6f4970c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="The Gordon and Betty Moore Field Laboratory" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="The Gordon and Betty Moore Field Laboratory" src="/assets/image_455839.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201bb09cc90d2970d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Walking around the buildings" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Walking around the buildings" src="/assets/image_194719.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201bb09cc90e1970d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="A lovely location to perform research" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="A lovely location to perform research" src="/assets/image_524565.jpg" border="0"></a><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201bb09cc90e9970d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Examining one of the projects" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Examining one of the projects" src="/assets/image_79570.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>One of the projects, which is truly fascinating, was <a href="http://mooreabiocode.org/" target="_blank">the Mo’orea Biocode project</a>, where the entire island – a tropical ecosystem – was catalogued from top to bottom. And literally from the top of its mountains to 100m off its shore. You have to check out its catalog of images. There are <a href="http://biocode.berkeley.edu/cgi/biocode_img_query?where-class=Gastropoda&amp;where-collectn=biocode&amp;where-specimen_no=mbio&amp;rel-specimen_no=begins+with" target="_blank">more than 2,500 gastropods</a> photographed and catalogued, for instance.</p><p>The next step in this project is also really interesting, and is called Ethnocode: they plan to take the catalogue and cross-index it with knowledge from the local population on the various applications – perhaps for construction or medicine. This kind of cross-disciplinary research is extremely interesting. You can hear Mrs. Murphy talking about the importance of this activity here:</p><p align="center"><br></p><p align="center"><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3gBYYqItGOw?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><br></p><p>Many thanks to Mrs. Murphy and the staff from Gump Station for the warm welcome and great introduction to the work that is done there.</p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b8d2b3d70f970c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="The family with Mrs. Murphy" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="The family with Mrs. Murphy" src="/assets/image_952201.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Thoroughly inspired, Kalan headed off for his second dive of the week. This time they went a little further to an area known for its sharks. Kalan and Celia swam with a couple of huge lemon sharks, which was a wonderful moment for them.</p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b8d2b3d716970c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Off for the dive" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Off for the dive" src="/assets/image_322857.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Mo’orea has very much lived up to our hopes and expectations. It’s a wonderful place, and we’ll definitely be back!</p><p>This afternoon we head back across to the mainland and tonight we’re flying off to Auckland to begin the New Zealand leg of our adventure.</p><p><em>By the way… if you’ve enjoyed these photos, you can see more (and more regularly) via </em><a href="http://instagram.com/monde_en_poche"><em>our Instagram page</em></a><em>.</em></p>
