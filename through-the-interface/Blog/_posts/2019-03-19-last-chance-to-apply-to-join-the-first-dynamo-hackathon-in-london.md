<p>On <strong>April 5th-6th, 2019</strong> in London, the <a href="http://www.ukdug.co.uk/dynamo-hackathon-april.html" target="_blank">UK Dynamo User Group is holding its first ever Dynamo Hackathon</a>. Several members of the Dynamo and Refinery teams will be there, as well as yours truly (I’ll only be there on the 5th, though, as I have family commitments over the weekend).</p><p>If you’d like to participate, you do need to move quickly: today (<strong>March 19th</strong>) is <a href="https://twitter.com/UKDynUG/status/1107629328161038336" target="_blank">the last day that submissions will be accepted</a>. (This deadline really crept up on me: I’ve been meaning to post about this for the last week or so, but was busy on other things… now is really the last moment, of course!)</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a47132c7200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="255" title="Dynamo Hackathon in London" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Dynamo Hackathon in London" src="/assets/image_814802.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Space is limited at the event: it’s the first of its kind, so the number of attendees is going to be held at around 30 or 40 (i.e. 10 teams of 3-4 participants). That does mean there’s a selection process: in order to guarantee the quality of this first event, applications will be selected based on the relevance of project submissions to the theme. Generative Design – using Refinery, in particular – is going to be a primary focus of the event, which means that describing a cool GD project of interest to you is likely to help get your application accepted.</p><p>So do not delay – apply today (and before 6pm UK time). I’m looking forward to seeing you on the 5th in London!</p>
