<p>I couldn’t visit Dublin without popping by Autodesk’s new office there. So it was that after <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2018/12/a-visit-to-kingspan-in-dublin.html" target="_blank">a great few days with the Kingspan team</a>, I hopped on the <a href="https://luas.ie/" target="_blank">Luas</a> green line from Leopardstown and headed into the centre of Dublin.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad3c7bd86200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Walking to the non-office" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Walking to the non-office" src="/assets/image_381498.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>I got off on the edge of the central zone at Charlemont and headed along the canal to the location Google Maps told me to target.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad382098a200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="530" height="420" title="Finding Autodesk in Dublin" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Finding Autodesk in Dublin" src="/assets/image_161283.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Unfortunately, on arriving at Fitzwilliam Place, I came to realise there was a problem with the instructions I’d been getting from Google. It didn’t really fit with the image in my head of our new European corporate headquarters.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad3a80ee4200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="The former office location" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="The former office location" src="/assets/image_561321.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>So I went and dug a bit deeper for the office address on our internal network, and realised that the information Google had was a little stale. Still, I felt like a 20-minute walk – and still had time to do it and make it to the airport on time – so headed north across Dublin.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad3a80ee8200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="530" height="420" title="Really finding Autodesk in Dublin" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Really finding Autodesk in Dublin" src="/assets/image_426958.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>It’s actually understandable the online information isn’t accurate: we had apparently only moved into the new space about 3 weeks before.</p><p>Here’s the main foyer:</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad382098e200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="The building Autodesk is in" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="The building Autodesk is in" src="/assets/image_82807.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>And our reception from the outside:</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad3820996200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Autodesk Dublin's reception" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Autodesk Dublin's reception" src="/assets/image_12414.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>I managed to bump into 3 former Autodesk Neuchatel colleagues within a few minutes of arriving: Sharon, Jay and Martin (who’s heading up the new office). Martin kindly gave me a tour.</p><p>There’s a nice Christmassy feel to the place, at the moment.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad382099a200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Christmas at Autodesk Dublin" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Christmas at Autodesk Dublin" src="/assets/image_71968.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>So far we have 140 people working from the office: from what I recall the aim is to have 2-3 times that number, but it’s nonetheless impressive to see that kind of ramp-up.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad3a80ef4200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="So far around 140 employees" style="margin: 30px auto;

border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="And more" src="/assets/image_237504.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Another nice touch is the use of Dublin’s world-famous Georgian doors on said conference rooms.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad38209ac200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="375" height="501" title="Conference room doors" style="margin: 30px auto;

border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Another view" src="/assets/image_697261.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Martin showed me the office Pub, which was due to be inaugurated last Friday.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad3a80f10200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="The Pub" style="margin: 30px auto;

Congratulations to those involved in making it happen (and to those lucky enough to be working there). Seeing this new space is certainly bittersweet for me – having lived through the closure of our former European HQ in Neuchatel, this year – but it’s important to look forwards rather than backwards.</p><p>And I’m definitely looking forward to coming back across, next year – at the latest in June for our annual football tournament, I expect – and discovering more of both Dublin and Ireland.
