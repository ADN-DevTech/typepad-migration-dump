<p>I’m on holiday with my family, this week, enjoying the Bernese Oberland with family and friends.</p><p>In Toronto – where I’m heading next week – my team-mates are busy trying out the 2D path-finding component <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2019/02/interested-in-space-analysis-for-dynamo-and-refinery.html" target="_blank">I talked about in the last post</a>. Now that Simon Breslav has wrapped the C++ path-finding module created by Rhys Goldstein – building a .NET wrapper and using it from Dynamo – he’s started using it to implement a version of the “buzz” metric <a href="https://autodeskresearch.com/groups/living" target="_blank">The Living</a> used for <a href="https://autodeskresearch.com/projects/project-discover" target="_blank">Project Discover</a>. Here’s a sneak peek of how it currently looks with one possible layout of the original <a href="https://autodeskresearch.com/projects/autodesk-mars" target="_blank">MaRS</a> floorplan.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad3c589c9200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="305" title="Buzz" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Buzz" src="/assets/image_862461.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad3e53258200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="305" title="Buzz with paths" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Buzz with paths" src="/assets/image_244627.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>This is really promising… I’ll find out – and hopefully share – more once I’m back from this week’s fun in the snow.</p>
