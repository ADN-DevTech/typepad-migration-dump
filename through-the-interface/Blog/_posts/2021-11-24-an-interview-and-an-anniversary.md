<p>Recently Mayur Mistry from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUvTDoPj6v7uGQy4J8oW4Yw" target="_blank">Engineering ArchiTECHure</a> asked me to join him for a <a href="https://youtu.be/32L1sxgtgQE" target="_blank">YouTube livestream</a>. Mayur often holds his interviews over the weekend, but he very kindly accommodated my schedule and held the session during the week. So while it was “live”, it wasn’t at the usual time for Mayur’s subscribers and the discussion remained very much between the two of us.</p><p style="text-align: center"><br /></p><p style="text-align: center"><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="283" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/32L1sxgtgQE" title="YouTube video player" width="500"></iframe></p><p><br /></p><p>I’ve seen some really good sessions on his channel – several of his guests have prepared extensive material to show – so my apologies if you’re expecting something more formal: we just chatted for an hour.</p><p>Many thanks to Mayur for inviting me. I’ve been very impressed by the quality (and quantity!) of his broadcasts, so it’s very nice to have been invited.</p><p>On a completely unrelated note, today is our 20th wedding anniversary.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2026bdf029881200c-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="Our wedding" border="0" height="500" src="/assets/image_577647.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="Our wedding" width="419" /></a></p><p>It’s Thanksgiving week in the US, of course. It’s not something we typically celebrate in Switzerland, but I’m giving my own thanks to my lovely wife, Celia, for having put up with being married to me for two whole decades. We’ve had a wonderful life together, and in many ways I feel like we’re only just getting started.</p><p>Tonight we’re going to celebrate by making vegan sushi with our 3 wonderful kids: an activity we all very much enjoy, despite not being vegan.</p>
