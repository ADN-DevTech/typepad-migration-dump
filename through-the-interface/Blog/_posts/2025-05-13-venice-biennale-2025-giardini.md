<p>I was up earlier than I needed to be on Saturday - even after <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2025/05/venice.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the MIT party of the night before</a> - so headed across to the <a href="https://www.labiennale.org/en/venues/giardini-della-biennale" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Giardini della Biennale</a> in very good time for the 11am opening.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_958543.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" height="500" src="/assets/image_958543.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Alley" width="375" /></a></p>
<p>It was a very nice walk along the main waterfront.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_764462.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Walking along the water." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_764462.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Walking along the water" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>I decided to stop nearby for breakfast. If I&#39;d known at the time that this would be the last thing that passed my lips until getting to the airport, I&#39;d definitely have eaten more.<a href="/assets/image_189348.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Breakfast by the water." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_189348.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Breakfast by the water" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>I walked through a very nice park with an arts &amp; craft market just being set up.<a href="/assets/image_65952.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="The gardens before the gardens." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_65952.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="The gardens before the gardens" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>I actually arrived at the gates of the Biennale at around 10:30am, just as the queue was starting to form. Before I knew it people were lining up for all the way along the water. I was happy to be in relative shade.</p>
<p>There are lots of really interesting people visiting the Biennale, it turns out. While in the queue I had a great chat with someone managing the planning for several hospitals in Berlin.<a href="/assets/image_485004.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="The start of the queue." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_485004.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="The start of the queue" width="500" /></a>What follows is my account of heading to several national pavilions at this year’s Biennale. I’ve decided to keep my pictures from the Arsenale for the next post.</p>
<p>Something that’s worth noting for both these posts: the Biennale is really big. I only had 2 hours to visit both the Giardini and the Arsenale - and there’s a 10-15 minute walk between each site - so I went around really quickly. I was happy that a fellow student on the <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2025/02/a-course-on-neuroscience-and-design-at-polidesign.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Neuroscience and Design class</a>, Ehab Mokhtar, joined me on this 2-hour sprint.</p>
<p>Which basically means that any opinions I express are based on very little information: I didn’t have time to stop and read the context. If you want deep analysis, please look elsewhere. While I’m at it, I may very well poke a little fun at the pavilions that I thought were less obviously compelling. Feel free to skip forward if this irritates you.</p>
<p>The first pavilion to the right on getting through the gates is from Switzerland.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_694573.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Swiss pavilion." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_694573.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Swiss pavilion" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>I wasn&#39;t fully sure whether they&#39;d finished setting up, to be completely honest.<a href="/assets/image_555878.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Inside the Swiss pavilion." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_555878.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Inside the Swiss pavilion" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Next was Denmark.<a href="/assets/image_932574.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="The Danish pavilion." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_932574.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="The Danish pavilion" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>This one looked more like a place they were storing the remains of a demolition project.<a href="/assets/image_184049.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Inside the Danish pavilion." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_184049.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Inside the Danish pavilion" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>After this we visited the pavilion for Finland, Norway and Sweden.<a href="/assets/image_670927.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="The Scandinavian pavilion." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_670927.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="The Scandinavian pavilion" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>This one was more visually interesting, at least.<a href="/assets/image_131976.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Inside the Scandinavian pavilion." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_131976.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Inside the Scandinavian pavilion" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Our next stop was at the American pavilion which was focused on “the porch”, a very American concept that I believe to be worthy of this exploration and even adoration.<a href="/assets/image_149914.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_149914.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Porch" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>I liked this pavilion.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_518807.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Inside the Porch exhibit." border="0" height="500" src="/assets/image_518807.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Inside the Porch exhibit" width="375" /></a></p>
<p>There were various student-driven studies on display.<a href="/assets/image_991075.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="A nice collection of exhibits." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_991075.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="A nice collection of exhibits" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Next was the Japanese pavilion.<a href="/assets/image_246211.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="The Japanese pavilion." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_246211.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="The Japanese pavilion" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>And it was very Japanese indeed. Which I liked.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_294188.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Inside the Japanese pavilion." border="0" height="500" src="/assets/image_294188.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Inside the Japanese pavilion" width="375" /></a></p>
<p>A huge beaten copper dish reflected light upwards to the floor above.<a href="/assets/image_935704.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Upstairs in the Japanese pavilion." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_935704.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Upstairs in the Japanese pavilion" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Onwards to Korea.<a href="/assets/image_482145.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="The Korean pavilion." border="0" height="500" src="/assets/image_482145.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="The Korean pavilion" width="375" /></a></p>
<p>I think there was something here relating to the connection between the North and South of the country. Not sure, though.<a href="/assets/image_4761.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Inside the Korean pavilion." border="0" height="500" src="/assets/image_4761.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Inside the Korean pavilion" width="375" /></a></p>
<p>There was a room with a big inflatable ball in it.<a href="/assets/image_559969.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="More of the Korean pavilion." border="0" height="500" src="/assets/image_559969.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="More of the Korean pavilion" width="375" /></a></p>
<p>The next pavilion we visited was the German one. This seemed to focus on heat, including thermal cameras feeding large screens in real-time.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_852980.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Inside the German pavilion." border="0" height="500" src="/assets/image_852980.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Inside the German pavilion" width="375" /></a></p>
<p>The broader message related to the warming climate, of course.<a href="/assets/image_415661.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="A focus on heat." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_415661.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="A focus on heat" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Next was the Canadian pavilion.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_779803.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="The Canadian pavilion." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_779803.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="The Canadian pavilion" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>I really liked this one. They had a huge tree-like structure made (or grown?) using picoplanktonics.<a href="/assets/image_179161.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Inside the Canadian pavilion." border="0" height="500" src="/assets/image_179161.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Inside the Canadian pavilion" width="375" /></a></p>
<p>A researcher explained that the exhibit would change through the course of the 6-month exhibition depending on (among other things) the particles absorbed from the visitors to the space.<a href="/assets/image_30018.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="An explanation of plankton." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_30018.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="An explanation of plankton" width="500" /></a>I even appreciated the layout of this pavilion, which was obvious from the evacuation plan.</p>
<p><img alt="The Golden spiral." border="0" height="500" src="/assets/image_763977.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="The Golden spiral" width="375" /></p>
<p>Then came the British pavilion.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_546493.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="The British pavilion." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_546493.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="The British pavilion" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>This one was highly visual.<a href="/assets/image_360416.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Inside the British pavilion." border="0" height="500" src="/assets/image_360416.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Inside the British pavilion" width="375" /></a></p>
<p>I appreciated the various different spaces.<a href="/assets/image_761027.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="More inside the British pavilion." border="0" height="500" src="/assets/image_761027.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="More inside the British pavilion" width="375" /></a></p>
<p>The French pavilion was more exposed to the elements.<a href="/assets/image_412128.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="The French pavilion." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_412128.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="The French pavilion" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>As this mainly seemed to be a set of printed descriptions of various projects - which I didn’t personally have the time to read - I found this one less than thrilling.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_991926.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Inside the French pavilion." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_991926.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Inside the French pavilion" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Next was the Australian pavilion.<a href="/assets/image_107187.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="The Australian pavilion." border="0" height="500" src="/assets/image_107187.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="The Australian pavilion" width="375" /></a></p>
<p>This space was very interesting, with a central area - where people were going barefoot to feel the sand - and an outer exhibit shelf.<a href="/assets/image_40683.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Inside the Australian pavilion." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_40683.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Inside the Australian pavilion" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>From here we crossed the canal to see a separate set of pavilions.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_500921.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Crossing the canal." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_500921.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Crossing the canal" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>We stopped by the Brazilian pavilion next.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_155271.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Inside the Brazilian pavilion." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_155271.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Inside the Brazilian pavilion" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>While also presenting lots of project information, it was done in a visually appealing way.<a href="/assets/image_499989.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="More of the Brazilian pavilion." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_499989.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="More of the Brazilian pavilion" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Out the back towards the Venice pavilion was an interesting garden space.<a href="/assets/image_731070.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="The gardens out the back." border="0" height="500" src="/assets/image_731070.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="The gardens out the back" width="375" /></a></p>
<p>My friend Ehab knows the team behind the Egyptian pavilion, so we had a nice chat with them before entering. The core of the exhibit was a long table balanced on a central pivot. You can move boxes around and see how things can quickly get out of balance. An exploration of decision trade-offs, I suppose.<a href="/assets/image_269364.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Inside the Egyptian pavilion." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_269364.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Inside the Egyptian pavilion" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>We stopped next at the Serbian pavilion.<a href="/assets/image_749378.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="The Serbian pavilion." border="0" height="500" src="/assets/image_749378.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="The Serbian pavilion" width="375" /></a></p>
<p>I really liked this large hanging cloth sculpture.<a href="/assets/image_866585.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Inside the Serbian pavilion." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_866585.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Inside the Serbian pavilion" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>The Austrian pavilion was next.<a href="/assets/image_461089.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="The Austrian pavilion." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_461089.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="The Austrian pavilion" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>There were two sections, once focused on Vienna….<a href="/assets/image_294431.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Inside the Austrian pavilion." border="0" height="500" src="/assets/image_294431.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Inside the Austrian pavilion" width="375" /></a></p>
<p>... and the other on Rome.<a href="/assets/image_18029.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="More of the Austrian pavilion." border="0" height="500" src="/assets/image_18029.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="More of the Austrian pavilion" width="375" /></a></p>
<p>Our last stop before running across to the Arsenale was the Polish pavilion.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_981412.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="The Polish pavilion." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_981412.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="The Polish pavilion" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>This was more like a modern art exhibition. I liked what I saw in the 30 seconds I stayed there.&#0160;</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_70053.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Inside the Polish pavilion." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_70053.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Inside the Polish pavilion" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>It’s one I would have liked to spend more time in (this is actually true for all the pavilions, to be fair).</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_227274.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="More of the Polish pavilion." border="0" height="500" src="/assets/image_227274.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="More of the Polish pavilion" width="375" /></a></p>
<p>We rushed past the Quatari pavilion - which I later learned served really good coffee - but I didn’t go inside.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_151736.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="The Qatari pavilion." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_151736.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="The Qatari pavilion" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>To find out more about our time in the Arsenale - which honestly comprised of me running through the space taking photos while trying not to flatten people - you can check the next post.</p>
<p>We arrived back just in time for the real reason for my trip to Venice: the debate between Davide Ruzzon and Thomas Heatherwick that was a large part of the closing session of the Neuroscience and Design class I’ve been attending over the last three months.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_711845.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" height="500" src="/assets/image_711845.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="The debate" width="375" /></a></p>
<p>The debate was held in the former Russian pavilion, which has been repurposed for educational sessions at the Biennale.<a href="/assets/image_390262.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="The lecture space." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_390262.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="The lecture space" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>It was fantastic to hear from both Davide and Thomas in this setting.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_274039.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="The setting in the former Russian pavilion." border="0" height="500" src="/assets/image_274039.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="The setting in the former Russian pavilion" width="375" /></a></p>
<p>Thomas spent quite a lot of time talking about the concepts shared in his Humanise book, the Kindle version of which I&#39;ve managed to read the first two thirds. It was really aligned with our research interests, which is just fantastic.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_83801.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Talking about Humanise." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_83801.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Talking about Humanise" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Interestingly - and this gives him a unique position to comment on the profession - Thomas isn’t actually an architect, and he used to drive a 2CV back in the 90s. So we have at least two things in common (beyond both being British).</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_866926.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Photo of Thomas Heatherwick by Ventina Mencarelli." border="0" height="500" src="/assets/image_866926.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Photo of Thomas Heatherwick by Ventina Mencarelli.jpeg" width="375" /></a></p>
<p>I had the chance to ask a question, so asked how Autodesk tools might support the Humanise effort to create buildings that are less “boring” (a term used a lot in Thomas&#39;s book).<a href="/assets/image_342920.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Me asking a question - photo by Ehab Mokhtar." border="0" height="500" src="/assets/image_342920.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Me asking a question - photo by Ehab Mokhtar.jpeg" width="375" /></a></p>
<p>Thomas mentioned the Boringometer, a software tool Heatherwick Studio has developed to help assess how boring a building is likely to be for passers-by.</p>
<p>Matt Bell from Humanise kindly gifted me a hardcopy of Humanise, which meant I could look it up and take a photo. It was - of course - in the last third of the book, which is why I hadn’t yet seen it. (Frankly this was a good thing - otherwise I might not have asked the question!)</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_240791.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="The Boringometer." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_240791.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="The Boringometer" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>As the session closed we headed outside for a class photo. I really enjoyed the time I spent with this group of people over the last few months: I do hope we manage to stay in touch.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_325663.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_325663.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="The class" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>After this there were a few project shareouts from students currently completing their <a href="http://www.naad-master.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Masters in NAAD</a> (Neuroscience Applied to Architectural Design) from the University of Venice. I had to leave a bit early at 4pm to leave enough time to get to the hotel for my 7:25pm flight.</p>
<p>I’m glad I left so much time: it took me 20 minutes to get back to the hotel to pick up my bag - so far so good - but from there everything went downhill. I tried to navigate through the city on foot while carrying my suitcase, but at some point along the way managed to end up on a path that involved taking a boat. (The recalculated navigation was really not clear this had happened… there aren’t many bridges over the Grand Canal, and I ended up a long way away from any. Argh.)</p>
<p>As I was a bit panicked, I rushed to get a ticket for the next boat but somehow ended up with a full-day pass. I then realised I could get a boat directly to the airport, but it was from a different company.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_114468.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" height="500" src="/assets/image_114468.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Not fun" width="375" /></a></p>
<p>So I ended up taking two separate boats with my day pass to get to the bus that goes to the airport.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_89836.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_89836.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Oh great" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>At least the view from my side of the boat was nice.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_741156.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Should have taken a gondola." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_741156.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Should have taken a gondola" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>We went under the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ponte_della_Costituzione" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Constitution Bridge</a> - famously designed by Santiago Calatrava - which is the bridge I wished I’d found a way to walk over from south to north, rather than taking all these boats.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_393555.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Ponte della Costituzione." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_393555.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Ponte della Costituzione" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Marco had helped me walk across it from north to south the day before, which is when I took this photo.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_506012.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Ponte della Costituzione from one side." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_506012.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Ponte della Costituzione from one side" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Anyway, to cut an already-too-long story short, I had a quick calming beer while waiting for the bus, then finally got to the airport after 2 hours of struggle from the Biennale, and grabbed a couple of slices of pizza before boarding my flight to Zurich.</p>
<p>While getting on to the flight I spotted <a href="https://dfab.ch/people/prof-kohler-matthias" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Matthias Kohler</a> from ETH Zürich, and we chatted briefly before finding our seats. So that was something.</p>
<p>The flight was uneventful, although having a window seat gave me an interesting view over the Venetian Lagoon. It looked like one settlement was recently flooded, but having <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@45.5322168,12.4117069,381a,35y,174.93h,73.64t/data=!3m1!1e3?entry=ttu&amp;g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDUwNy4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D" rel="noopener" target="_blank">looked at it on Google Maps</a> this doesn’t seem like a new situation.</p>

<p>I got home at 11pm, tired but (by this point) happy. It was a really great experience to visit Venice for the opening of the Biennale! I hope next time I manage to get invited to the “industry preview” days which would allow time to visit before the opening proper.</p>
<p>In the meantime I still have a couple of days on the pass given as part of my course - which I can use anytime before the closing in late November - so I hope I’ll be able to make it back before then to visit things a bit more peacefully.</p>
