<p>I thought I was done with my posts for the week, but this was too good not to share. The below video shows a scene being captured using a GoPro Hero 3 Black edition on a 5-second timelapse setting mounted on a DJI Phantom drone and processed with Photo on ReCap 360 before being used as a basis for a conceptual model created in Revit 2014. Phew.</p>  <br /><iframe height="264" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/9vTG6lLFoKc?rel=0" frameborder="0" width="469" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>  <br />  <br />  <p>This is very much a proof-of-concept rather than a genuine project – no architect was involved, for instance – but it does a good job of showing the possibilities of this kind of workflow.</p>
