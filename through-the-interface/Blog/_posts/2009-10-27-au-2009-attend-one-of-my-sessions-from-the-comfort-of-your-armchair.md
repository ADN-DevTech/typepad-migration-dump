<p>Seeing <a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2009/10/au-2009.html">Jeremy's post from Friday</a>, I decided to give you a quick update of where I am with my own preparation for this year’s Autodesk University.</p>  <p>I’m delivering two sessions, this year:</p>  <ul>   <li><a href="http://au.autodesk.com/?nd=e_class&amp;session_id=5124&amp;jid=323682">CP9214-1 AutoCAD® .NET – Developing for AutoCAD Using F#</a></li>    <li><a href="http://au.autodesk.com/?nd=e_class&amp;session_id=5125">CP208-1 AutoCAD® .NET – Developing for AutoCAD Using IronPython and IronRuby</a></li> </ul>  <p>So yes, it seems as though I’m carving out a niche for myself as “the quirky languages guy”. :-)</p>  <p>The first one of these is actually a virtual session, and will be broadcast twice during the week of AU. It’s one I presented already, last year, and here you’ll find <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2008/10/au-handouts-aut.html">both</a> <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2008/10/au-handouts-a-1.html">parts</a> of last year’s handouts, although as the F# language has evolved over the last year I’ve had to make some updates that I’ll post, in due course. The good news about it being a virtual session is that you don’t need to travel to Las Vegas to attend the session (I’ll be online from Las Vegas during both the broadcast slots to answer any questions that attendees might have).</p>  <p>The second session I’m presenting is a physical one (in that I’ll be in the same room as the attendees, the only exercise involved will be mental, I assure you :-) and is covering brand new content. During the session we’ll look at the benefits of dynamic programming languages and then focus on integrating <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/ironpython/">IronPython</a> and <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/ironruby/">IronRuby</a> with AutoCAD. We’ll work through a number of samples I’ve posted here, such as jigging solids and turning lines and circles into pipes using the Overrule API in AutoCAD 2010.</p>  <p>For anyone with an interest in broadening their horizons from a programming language perspective (something in which I’m personally a strong believer), I thoroughly recommend signing up for one or other of these classes.</p>  <p>Here is a little more information on <a href="http://www.autodesk.com/auvirtual">AU Virtual</a>:</p>  <ul>   <li>Event date: December 1-4, 2009</li>    <li><a href="http://au.autodesk.com/?nd=virtual_class_listing">50+ Classes and Sessions</a> streamed “live”</li>    <li>A <strong>“Premium Pass”</strong> (full access) is <strong>only US$99</strong></li>    <li>All <strong>Subscription</strong> customers receive a <strong>free</strong> “Premier Pass”</li>    <li>A <strong>“Free Pass”</strong> (limited access) is available to <strong>anyone</strong></li>    <li><a href="http://au.autodesk.com/?nd=event_compare_au_virtual">How AU Virtual compares with AU “On-Site”</a></li> </ul>
