<p>In Europe we’re about to celebrate the long Easter weekend, so things have been a little busy finishing up work in a number of areas, especially as soon after I’ll be heading across to the US for the rest of the month.</p>
<p>I managed to submit two Autodesk University 2025 proposals - let’s hope that at least one of them gets accepted.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_167018.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="AU classes submitted" src="/assets/image_167018.jpg" alt="AU classes submitted." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>I was also (apparently) the first DevCon presenter to record <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2025/02/learn-about-combining-aps-and-webassembly-at-autodesk-devcon-europe.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">their session</a> ahead of next month’s event. I’m very happy to have gotten that one out of the way before my travels.</p>

<p>I haven’t had time to properly check out <a href="https://dynamobim.org/dynamo-core-3-5-release/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the latest Dynamo release</a>, but I’m very excited about its <a href="https://dynamobim.org/introducing-the-curve-mapper-node-in-dynamo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">awesome new Curve Mapper node</a>. I’m also thrilled to see the <a href="https://forum.dynamobim.com/t/dynamo-forma-connection-now-in-open-beta/109224" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dynamo for Forma extension going into open Beta</a> (this is driven by the Dynamo as a Service back-end which is hosting VASA, among other things). If you want to give it a try, why not participate in the “<a href="https://forum.dynamobim.com/t/dynamo-challenge-03-make-anything-with-dynamo-as-a-service-daas-in-forma/109225" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Make Anything with Dynamo as a Service (DaaS) in Forma</a>” challenge? If you make something using VASA I’ll be sure to give you a special shout-out. :-)</p>

<p>This morning I had a call with a neuroscience laboratory to talk about Workshop XR. We had a parallel Zoom session, to help with coordination, but I can see we’re getting close to the point where this is redundant.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_654961.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Workshop XR fun" src="/assets/image_654961.jpg" alt="Workshop XR fun." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>It was really interesting to have a session with the full-length avatars that were introduced in <a href="https://help.autodesk.com/view/WKSXR/ENU/?guid=WKSXR_Release_Notes_release_notes_2_7_16_html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">version 2.7.16</a> (although I’m now using them in <a href="https://help.autodesk.com/view/WKSXR/ENU/?guid=WKSXR_Release_Notes_release_notes_2_8_20_html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">version 2.8.20</a>): it makes a surprising difference! I didn’t take a video or screenshot at the time, but I will at some point: I’ve been working on my avatar to make it a bit more realistic. With a new-found focus on footwear.</p>
