<p><a href="http://au.autodesk.com/2007/blogs/Podcasts/">AU BEAT</a> is a series of interview-style podcasts held with instructors, presenters and key AU stakeholders. The series provide a valuable glimpse into the programs and activities planned for this year's AU.</p>

<p>On the subject of AU... over the next two weeks I'm going to be heads-down preparing handout material for my AU sessions. As a taster for my two sessions (<em>DE319-2: There's More to .DWG Than AutoCAD®</em> &amp; <em>DE401-2: Enriching Your DWF™</em>), I'm going to post the hand-out material here, too. The two sessions will dive more deeply into the material created for the recorded presentation available from <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2007/03/recorded_presen.html">this previous post</a>.</p>
