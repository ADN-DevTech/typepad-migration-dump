<p>Rhys Goldstein has published <a href="https://youtu.be/Jwm3mSnJWAA" target="_blank">the second part</a> of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5DhpoI3HKE99RFSWsxsLVPHGqxQ5TVuc" target="_blank">his informative video series</a> on using the <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2021/09/introducing-vasa-for-voxel-based-architectural-space-analysis.html" target="_blank">VASA (Voxel-based Architectural Space Analysis)</a> package with Dynamo. <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2021/11/a-video-introduction-to-vasa.html" target="_blank">The first part</a> was an overall introduction to the package while this part dives into pathfinding, taking a close look at samples that show how it might be used in both 2D and 3D.</p><p>While the overall video is really interesting – some of you might find it a bit long at 43 minutes but it’s quite watchable at 2X and is packed full of useful information – one of the sections that stood out for me was where Rhys digs into voxel sizing and how you can tweak it to fit your usage scenario.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2027880586fa0200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="312" title="Voxel sizes" style="margin: 30px auto; float: none; display: block;" alt="Voxel sizes" src="/assets/image_891612.jpg"></a></p><p>Here’s the video:</p><p align="center"><br></p><p align="center"><iframe width="500" height="283" title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Jwm3mSnJWAA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"></iframe></p><p><br></p><p>I’ve myself used some of the techniques Rhys discusses in this video to tweak the performance of a Dynamo script integrating VASA with the FormIt, something we’ll see in an upcoming post.</p>
