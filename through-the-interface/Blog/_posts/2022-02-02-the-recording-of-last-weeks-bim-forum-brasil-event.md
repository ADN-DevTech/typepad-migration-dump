<p>Our friends at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/bim-forum-brasil/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">BIM Fórum Brasil</a> have now posted <a href="https://youtu.be/vj9wEN3Ivxs" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the recording</a> of <a href="https://www.bimforum.org.br/post/o-valor-do-bim-para-os-propriet%C3%A1rios-na-constru%C3%A7%C3%A3o-de-g%C3%AAmeos-digitais" rel="noopener" target="_blank">last week’s event on Digital Twins</a>. (If the last link says &quot;We Couldn&#39;t Find This Page&quot;, just click on the Brazilian flag in the page header.)</p>
<p>A big chunk of the session is in Portuguese, but my piece was in English. If you only understand English, I suggest skipping forward to the 20-minute mark. If you’ve heard me talk about this topic before, you might still want to check out the section on the Dar Smart Bridge project at the 35-minute mark. (Be ready to crank up the play speed: I speak slowly at the best of times, and I was making a special effort to speak even more slowly for comprehensibility.)</p>

<p>Once again, here’s the sneak peek of the data from the Dar Bridge that I shared last week. I’ll share some additional information about this fascinating project in an upcoming post.</p>

<p>Thanks to my Brazilian colleagues, Joyce, Fernanda and João, as well as to Wilton and the team at BIM Fórum Brasil for making me feel so welcome. It really was a fun event!</p>
