This effort has led to <a href="http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/index?siteID=123112&amp;id=16459234" target="_blank">the “My First Plug-In” series</a>, of which we now have two guides ready:</p>  <p><a href="http://autodesk.com/myfirstrevitplugin" target="_blank">My First Revit Plug-In</a></p>  <p><a href="http://autodesk.com/myfirstinventorplugin" target="_blank">My First Inventor Plug-In</a></p>    <p>This series is really intended for power-users of Autodesk software who want to take their use of our products to the next level, but need some targeted help on the programming side of things.</p>  <p>We currently have guides for Maya and AutoCAD in the works. While many of this blog’s readership won’t need this kind of assistance, I think many will enjoy what Stephen Preston is cooking up for AutoCAD. ;-)</p>  <p>And perhaps others will enjoy learning a little about Revit and Inventor with the above guides: be sure to take a look and <a href="mailto:myfirstplugin@autodesk.com" target="_blank">let us know what you think</a>.</p>
