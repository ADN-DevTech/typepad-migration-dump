<p>Yesterday the registration for the Forge DevCon and Autodesk University 2019 in Las Vegas opened. It’s also the time speakers can find out when their classes our scheduled: it’s always with a little apprehension that I find myself checking the schedule. I’m pretty happy with the slots I have, this year, though:</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4c15cef200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="329" title="My AU 2019 classes" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="My AU 2019 classes" src="/assets/image_836062.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>As you can see my sessions are both at 10:30am, <a href="https://autodeskuniversity.smarteventscloud.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=322461" target="_blank">one on Wednesday November 20th</a> and <a href="https://autodeskuniversity.smarteventscloud.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=322469" target="_blank">the other on Thursday November 21st</a>. Which means I should largely be over my jetlag by the time I have to present, which is always good. Although I may well be Vegas-lagged by then, of course. :-)</p><p>This year the event will be a little bittersweet for many, as it’s the last one being held in Las Vegas. I’ve been to so many Autodesk events in Las Vegas, over the years, that I’m very happy for the change. That said, a small part of me will miss it.</p><p>I do think this is going to be a fun event for me, at least: we’ve been making some pretty significant changes to <a href="http://dasher360.com" target="_blank">Dasher 360</a> over the last few weeks, and it’s going to be great to unveil these (hopefully in conjunction with some bigger news about the project). I’m also looking forward to creating some beginning-to-end workflow material on Project Rediscover, to show how we were able to implement the MaRS Dynamo graph and use it with Refinery. So lots of really cool stuff to talk about.</p><p>Anyway, do head on over and register to take advantage of the early bird pricing (which ends in October, I believe), as well as to get spaces in the classes that are of interest to you. So far I have around 15 people signed up for each of my classes, but they very often do end up being full. Registering early does give you more choice from the catalog, for sure.</p><p>See you in Vegas!</p>
