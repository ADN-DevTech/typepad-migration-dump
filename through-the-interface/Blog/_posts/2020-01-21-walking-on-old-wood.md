<p>I was due to meet with a customer in Zurich on Monday of this week, but unfortunately it had to be rescheduled at
  fairly short notice.</p>
<p>As I’d already bought a non-refundable train ticket – if you buy them a little in advance you can get a day ticket
  for the whole of Switzerland for less than a return ticket to Zurich, which can be very handy – I decided to head
  across to Zurich anyway. I used the morning for another meeting – luckily the person I wanted to catch up with was in
  the office – and then took a minor detour on my way home.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4b56386200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="245" title="My trip around Switerland" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="My trip around Switerland" src="/assets/image_243785.jpg" border="0"></a></p>
<p>The fine city of Luzern – known as Lucerne in French, but in English I tend to use German names for Swiss cities I
  think of as being primarily German-speaking – is a mere 45-minutes by train from Zurich.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a50334ce200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Arriving in Luzern" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Arriving in Luzern" src="/assets/image_501672.jpg" border="0"></a></p>
<p>I arrived a little before noon, and decided I had to be back on a train at 1pm to get home in time for my afternoon
  meetings. Thanks to <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.ch/Restaurant_Review-g188064-d8753615-Reviews-Prik_Thai-Lucerne.html" target="_blank">TripAdvisor</a> I found a simple Thai restaurant near the station, and was served and fed within a
  record 10 minutes. Perfect!</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4de8e72200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Yellow curry with vegetables and tofu" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Yellow curry with vegetables and tofu" src="/assets/image_117469.jpg" border="0"></a></p>

<p>My plan for the remaining 50 minutes or so was to see the two historical wooden footbridges across the River Reuss in
  central Luzern.</p>
<p>I have a passion for wood as a material: I love wooden structures – and also love that we’re increasingly <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2015/10/jpf-ducret-rebuilding-cerns-globe-using-autocad-and-hsbcad.html" target="_blank">using CLT as a building material</a> – and even drive <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2013/09/a-tour-of-the-factory-at-the-morgan-motor-company.html" target="_blank">a car
    that’s partially made of wood</a>. Seeing old wooden bridges is a real treat, especially when they date back as
  far as the 14th century.</p>
<p>The first bridge I visited was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kapellbr%C3%BCcke" target="_blank">Kapellbrücke</a> or Chapel Bridge, the larger of the two.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4de8e92200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="170" title="Chapel bridge pano" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Chapel bridge pano" src="/assets/image_576131.jpg" border="0"></a></p>
<p>It was originally built in 1360 but was then tragically destroyed by fire in 1993 and almost completely rebuilt in
  1994. Besides such catastrophic events, wood does need regular maintenance, of course: if you look closely at the
  above picture you may see scaffolding on the left hand side of the bridge. They’re currently replacing various
  structural beams, for instance.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a50334de200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Looking across the Chapel bridge" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Looking across the Chapel bridge" src="/assets/image_367919.jpg" border="0"></a></p>
<p>It is the longer, more physically impressive of the two bridges, but I have to say the less charming. They’ve done a
  fantastic job of rebuilding the bridge, as you can see…</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4b5632d200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="375" height="500" title="View along the inside of the Chapel Bridge" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="View along the inside of the Chapel Bridge" src="/assets/image_656284.jpg" border="0"></a></p>
<p>… but knowing it’s really only about 25 years old somehow does take a little of the shine off it.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4de8ea2200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="The Chapel Bridge with birds on it" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="The Chapel Bridge with birds on it" src="/assets/image_882714.jpg" border="0"></a></p>
<p>The second bridge, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spreuer_Bridge" target="_blank">Spreuerbrücke</a>, is
  quite a bit smaller. It was built in 1408 and then partially destroyed in 1566 and the 1870s. So it’s been rebuilt,
  but mostly sometime after 1566, so it’s still very old.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a50334f2200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="The Spreuer Bridge" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="The Spreuer Bridge" src="/assets/image_512161.jpg" border="0"></a></p>
<p>Much like it’s larger sibling, the Spreuerbrücke contains many historical paintings, but these all depict Death in
  its various forms. Which is all very cool for Terry Pratchett fans like me.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4de8eb1200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="375" height="500" title="Inside the Spreuer Bridge" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Inside the Spreuer Bridge" src="/assets/image_449492.jpg" border="0"></a></p>
<p>The paintings were made in the early 17th century, and a good portion (45 of 67, apparently) are still there.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4b56338200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="The bend in the Spreuer Bridge" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="The bend in the Spreuer Bridge" src="/assets/image_971525.jpg" border="0"></a></p>
<p>It’s just gorgeous.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4b5633c200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="375" height="500" title="The Danse Macabre" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="The Danse Macabre" src="/assets/image_372218.jpg" border="0"></a></p>
<p>Even for people who aren’t wood-mad, this is a great experience. Luzern is one of Switzerland’s most visited cities,
  and it’s obvious why.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a5033525200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Me on the Spreuer Bridge" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Me on the Spreuer Bridge" src="/assets/image_538655.jpg" border="0"></a></p>
<p>The walk from the second bridge to the train station took me along the River Reuss. I couldn’t tell whether this was a changeable lock or a weir, but there was a whole load of water rushing through a wooden structure.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a5033605200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Rushing water" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Rushing water" src="/assets/image_851171.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>I had a lovely walk around Luzern in my quick stop there.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4b56415200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="207" title="My walk around Luzern" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="My walk around Luzern" src="/assets/image_31127.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>I was back at the station with about 5 minutes to spare before hopping on my train to Bern and then onwards to my
village.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4b56415200c-pi" target="_blank"><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a503352b200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Leaving Luzern" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Leaving Luzern" src="/assets/image_693034.jpg" border="0"></a></a></p>
<p>It was a great way to spend the middle of my day: I was able to rattle out a few emails – and catch up with some
  reading – on the train, and was home in good time for my afternoon meetings. Maybe next time I’ll get to go through the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gotthard_Base_Tunnel" target="_blank">Gotthard Base Tunnel</a> to Bellinzona, but that’s something for when I have a full day to spare.</p>
