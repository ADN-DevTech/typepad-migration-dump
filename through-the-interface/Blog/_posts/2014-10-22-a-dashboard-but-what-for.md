<p>Here’s a little bit of fun. There’s a new dashboard in the San Rafael office, but what does it show?</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b7c6f7ce33970b-pi" target="_blank"><img title="Dashboard" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 20px auto; border-left: 0px; display: block; padding-right: 0px" border="0" alt="Dashboard" src="/assets/image_182703.jpg" width="480" height="278" /></a></p>  <p>Post your guess as a comment: the closest – or most humorous, depending on my mood – will win a free “<strong>I♥3D</strong>” Autodesk T-shirt (I’ll contact the winner to get their size).</p>  <p>And when I say humorous that doesn’t mean rude or insulting. Please keep it clean &amp; polite, people. :-)</p>
