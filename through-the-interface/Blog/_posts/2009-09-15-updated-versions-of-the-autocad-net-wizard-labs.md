<p>As mentioned <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2009/06/a-new-project-wizard-for-autocad-net-development.html">a few months ago</a>, we’ve been working on a project wizard for AutoCAD .NET development. The official version of this tool is now available via the <a href="http://www.autodesk.com/developautocad">AutoCAD Developer Center</a> (a direct link to the download can be found <a href="http://images.autodesk.com/adsk/files/autocad_2010_dotnet_wizards.zip">here</a>).</p>
<p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20120a570777b970b-pi"><img align="right" alt="AutoCAD Developer Center with new Labs and Wizards" border="0" height="265" src="/assets/image_863870.jpg" style="BORDER-RIGHT-WIDTH: 0px; MARGIN: 0px 10px 10px 20px; DISPLAY: inline; BORDER-TOP-WIDTH: 0px; BORDER-BOTTOM-WIDTH: 0px; BORDER-LEFT-WIDTH: 0px" title="AutoCAD Developer Center with new Labs and Wizards" width="262" /></a>We incorporated a number of enhancement requests received from people working with the previous, draft version, but I don’t have an exhaustive list of the updates, unfortunately. If you provided feedback, thank you for taking the time to do so, and hopefully the issue you faced has been addressed in this updated version (and please do <a href="mailto:oarxwiz-feedback@autodesk.com">let us know</a>, if not).</p>
<p></p>
<p>On a related note, an updated version of the AutoCAD .NET Labs is also available from the same location (the direct link is <a href="http://images.autodesk.com/adsk/files/autocad_2010_dotnet_training.zip">here</a>). This is a great resource for someone getting started with AutoCAD .NET development, and is the material we use when delivering <a href="http://www.autodesk.com/apitraining">AutoCAD .NET training</a>. You’ll find included a PowerPoint presentation along with step-by-step samples in both C# and VB.NET.</p>
<p>A big thanks to those involved in providing these tools, especially our resident Wizard wizard, Cyrille Fauvel.</p>
