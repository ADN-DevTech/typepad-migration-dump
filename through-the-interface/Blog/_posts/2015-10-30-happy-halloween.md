<p>As is typical, for this time of year, there were some strange sightings at Autodesk Neuchâtel, today. Here I am dressed as Jabba the Hutt, getting a latte in our new coffee area.</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b8d16ed9b2970c-pi" target="_blank"><img title="Jabba the Hutt" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 50px auto; border-left: 0px; display: block; padding-right: 0px" border="0" alt="Jabba the Hutt" src="/assets/image_721679.jpg" width="504" height="285" /></a></p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b8d16ed9b6970c-pi"><img title="Jabba&#39;s waddle" style="float: right; margin: 0px 0px 20px 30px; display: inline" alt="Jabba&#39;s waddle" src="/assets/image_610339.jpg" width="135" align="right" height="240" /></a>The costume’s a lot of fun, if a little hot. It has an integrated fan, powered by 4 AA batteries, so at least there’s some air circulating. It’s a little tricky to walk in (especially when going through doors – I’ve learned to do a little spin to make sure the tail doesn’t get caught and I end up falling on my nose), but at least my colleagues have found it entertaining to watch me waddling around.</p>  <p>Now for the best bit: I’ve managed to convince my 6 year-old daughter to dress as “<a href="http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Slave_Leia_costume" target="_blank">Slave Leia</a>” – complete with choker and chain – for our party, tomorrow night. Not being such a Star Wars fan, my wife finds the whole thing slightly disturbing, but I’m not analysing it too deeply. And I’m definitely not going to remind Leia of <a href="https://youtu.be/lk5LtTRCMow" target="_blank">how she strangles Jabba</a> at the end of the classic “Return of the Jedi” scene.</p>
