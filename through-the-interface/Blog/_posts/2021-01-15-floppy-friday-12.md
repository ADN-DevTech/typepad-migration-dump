<p>In <a href="https://youtu.be/aHIMnXlBAhM" target="_blank">this week’s episode of Floppy Friday</a> we take a look at two games that came on a <a href="https://www.c64-wiki.com/wiki/Game_On">Game On</a> floppy from April 1991: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turrican_II:_The_Final_Fight">Turrican II</a> and <a href="http://www.gamebase64.com/game.php?id=6019&amp;d=18&amp;h=0">Pure Seed</a>. I realised afterwards that Turrican II was made available as a demo version on the floppy – and that I’d loaded the “main” program rather than the demo loader, which explained the lack of loading screen, etc.</p><p align="center"><br></p><p align="center"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aHIMnXlBAhM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"></iframe></p><p><br></p><p>I used a <a href="http://retro.lonningdal.net/home.php?page=Hardware&amp;select=1311%20Joystick" target="_blank">Commodore 1311 joystick</a> – known as <a href="https://www.retrothing.com/2011/12/worst-retro-joystick-ever.html">the worst joystick ever created</a>, and apparently a poor copy of the classic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_CX40_joystick" target="_blank">Atari CX40</a> – to play the games, and liked it a lot. :-) If you’re curious about what’s inside <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWZvovTtz0" target="_blank">this video is really interesting</a>.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20263e9888372200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="300" height="400" title="Commodore 1311 joystick" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Commodore 1311 joystick" src="/assets/image_17807.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>I’ve been having a lot of “fun” (which is short for frustration ;-) trying to get a “<a href="https://www.lemon64.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=61224&amp;amp;start=15" target="_blank">breadbin</a>” C64 working fully. (Until now I’ve been using a much-less-classy C64C.)</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2026bdeb5d2ea200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="283" title="Commodore 64" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Commodore 64" src="/assets/image_878966.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>As mentioned in this episode, I finally succeeded – I swapped the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOS_Technology_VIC-II">VIC-II</a> chips with another non-working C64, and it allowed one of them to work – so I’ll be able to show that in the next episode, along with a new (old) floppy drive that seems to work brilliantly (loading games from floppies that I’d previously thought were corrupted).</p><p>I’ve also invested in some desoldering equipment and have bought some chip sockets that will hopefully allow me to start performing more radical repairs: I’m hoping to be able to resurrect the other C64, too, although I suspect this will be quite a bit harder to do. We’ll see!</p>
