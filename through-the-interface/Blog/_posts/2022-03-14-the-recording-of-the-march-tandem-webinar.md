<p>It’s also on YouTube, so you can <a href="https://youtu.be/ZEXoeS42njc" rel="noopener" target="_blank">watch it directly over there</a>.</p>

<p>One really interesting section was Tim Kelly’s demo (starting around the 26-minute mark) of work the Tandem team has been doing to integrate Dasher-like capabilities into the product. Really exciting stuff!</p>
<p>Here’s a preview of that segment of the webinar:<a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2027880704492200d-pi" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Tandem webinar demo" height="312" src="/assets/image_826773.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; float: none; display: block;" title="Tandem webinar demo" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Thanks again to Adam, Tim and Bob for having me on their webinar. I hope people found the historical context about Project Dasher to be of interest.</p>
