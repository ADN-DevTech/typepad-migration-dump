<p>I visited <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/de-ch/events/shape" target="_blank">another Windows 8-related conference</a> in Zürich, yesterday. Despite much of the content being repeated from the last one I attended, I actually found it really useful: having spent time working with Windows 8 and WinRT over the last few weeks, I found I got more out of the demos and could also ask more intelligent questions of the Microsoft personnel in attendance (thanks for all your help, Ronnie :-). And there was some new content I hadn’t seen, previously: I managed to sit in briefly on an Azure session (which was admittedly a bit too IT-centric for my personal tastes) and a couple of “WinRT via HTML5 &amp; Javascript” sessions, too.</p>  <p>During the breaks, I also took the opportunity to finish off a half-completed feature in the MetroCAD app: snapping. Snapping allows you – on screens with a minimum resolution of 1366 x 768, something <a href="http://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/enable-windows-8-snap-feature-and-how-to-snap-metro-application/" target="_blank">you could circumvent with the Windows 8 Developer Preview</a> but not with the Consumer preview, it seems – to dock one application to one side of the screen while you have another application (even your traditional Windows desktop) available on the other side. This mode is the way Windows 8 enables users to “multi-task” (meant at the user-level rather than the process level), making use of multiple applications at the same time (as otherwise Metro-style applications run in full screen).</p>  <p>I won’t go into the specific code changes, as most of the code was there, just needed tidying up (as I simply hadn’t tested that mode of operation before yesterday).</p>  <p>Here’s <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/files/MetroCAD-3.zip" target="_blank">the updated source project</a>, and here’s snapping in action:</p>  <p><object data="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/presentations/jingswfplayer.swf" height="269" id="scPlayer" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="470"> <param name="data" value="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/presentations/jingswfplayer.swf" /> <param name="quality" value="high" /> <param name="bgcolor" value="#FFFFFF" /> <param name="flashVars" value="thumb=http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/presentations/FirstFrame-3.jpg&amp;containerwidth=470&amp;containerheight=269&amp;content=http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/presentations/MetroCAD-3.swf&amp;blurover=false" /> <param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /> <param name="scale" value="showall" /> <param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always" /> <param name="base" value="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/presentations/" /> <param name="src" value="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/presentations/jingswfplayer.swf" /> </object></p>  <p>I’m now fairly happy with implementation of the snapping feature and the overall capabilities of the app, which means I can crack on with the series on <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2012/03/moving-to-the-cloud.html" target="_blank">moving application functionality to the cloud</a>.</p>
