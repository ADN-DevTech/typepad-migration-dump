<p>For the last 5 years or so, Autodesk has gathered feedback from our developer community regarding the API features you would most like to see in future Autodesk products. These surveys have traditionally been open to <a href="http://www.autodesk.com/joinadn">Autodesk Developer Network</a> members, but this year for the first time we're opening them up to developers and customers who are not part of ADN.</p>

<p>I've been managing these surveys for the last 3 years and the experience has proven to be very rewarding. Every year we see a number of items get knocked off the various lists: our Engineering teams really appreciate the feedback and respond to it.</p>

<p>So, please do take the time to respond to the surveys for the products in which you're interested. If you (optionally) provide your email address when filling out a survey, you'll get the results of that survey emailed to you, once it has closed and the results have been compiled.</p>
