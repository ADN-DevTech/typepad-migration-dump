Here’s <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/redshift/generative-architecture/" target="_blank">the article with the video and its transcript</a>. I really like the way the animations illustrate some possibilities for the technology. Here’s one relating to stadium design:</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4e63ed7200b-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="Baseball stadium" height="263" src="/assets/image_181178.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; float: none; display: block;" title="Baseball stadium" width="500" /></a></p><p>I also saw <a href="https://adsknews.autodesk.com/stories/generative-design-high-potential-aec-industry" target="_blank">a more complete article</a> has been posted giving useful context regarding the video about the GD residency in Toronto I shared in <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2019/10/looking-back-at-the-gd-for-aec-residency-looking-forward-to-the-dbei-hackathon.html" target="_blank">this previous post.</a> Something else to check out, when you get the chance.</p><p>From my side I feel like I’m making good progress on AU prep, which is just as well considering I’ll be flying out in 2 short weeks.</p></p>
