<p>I mentioned this initiative <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2014/05/free-autodesk-software-for-students-and-educators.html" target="_blank">a few months ago</a>, but it turns it hadn’t been rolled out everywhere: there were regional exceptions meaning that students in certain countries weren’t eligible for the program at that point. So my apologies if it sounds like I’m repeating myself, but at least it’s good news that I’m announcing twice. :-)<a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b7c6efc1d5970b-pi" target="_blank"><img title="students.autodesk.com" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 20px auto; border-left: 0px; display: block; padding-right: 0px" border="0" alt="students.autodesk.com" src="/assets/image_457237.jpg" width="470" height="284" /></a></p>  <p>The last kinks have been ironed out of the program, so now students, teachers and schools <strong>anywhere in the world</strong> can now download and use the following Autodesk software<strong> for free</strong>…<a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b8d079b65f970c-pi" target="_blank"><img title="Free software list" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 20px auto; border-left: 0px; display: block; padding-right: 0px" border="0" alt="Free software list" src="/assets/image_238751.jpg" width="300" height="1182" /></a></p>  <p>So if you’re a student who was expecting to be able to get free Autodesk software tools based on my previous post but it didn’t work out, check again on <a href="http://students.autodesk.com" target="_blank">students.autodesk.com</a> – this time it will!</p>
