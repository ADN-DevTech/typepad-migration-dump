<p>It struck me as a good time to remind people of some good learning resources for the APIs to Autodesk products.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2006/06/getting_started.html">Developer Centers</a> are really the first place to start, from where you can typically access API documentation and (increasingly) <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/devtv">DevTV sessions</a> for our various platform products.</p>

<p>Another great resource people may not realise is available <strong>to everyone, for free</strong> is our collection of API webcasts, which can not only be attended for free but also downloaded and viewed offline. You can access these via <a href="http://www.adskconsulting.com/adn/cs/api_course_sched.php">this direct link</a> to the training schedule, or by clicking on &quot;Schedule&quot; from <a href="http://www.autodesk.com/apitraining">http://www.autodesk.com/apitraining</a> (I do it this way - I just find it easier than looking up bookmarked links). This page allows you to register for future events, but you'll also see &quot;download&quot; links on the right-hand side of the session list, if recordings are available for past sessions.</p>

<p>To give you an idea of the content available, here are the recorded AutoCAD API webcasts that are available for download:</p>

<p>The recording of this week's webcast should be posted any day:</p>

<ul><li>AutoCAD: Creating a UI using WPF</li></ul>

<p>And there's one upcoming AutoCAD webcast - scheduled for September 16th - open for <a href="http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/item?id=10417086&amp;siteID=123112&amp;cname=AutoCAD .NET: Developing a User Interface, Webcast, Sep 16 2008, 4000">registration</a>:</p>

<ul><li>AutoCAD .NET: Developing a User Interface</li></ul>

<p>We're currently thinking about how best to run these webcasts in the future, so please let me know of any topics you'd like to see us focus on. One of the primary goals for these webcasts is to provide an opportunity for more direct contact with our DevTech team: for more polished content we focus on DevTV sessions, which we have the chance to edit and where we have more control over the recording quality (the recordings provided automatically by LiveMeeting seem optimised for size rather than quality).</p>

<p>And if you have feedback on any aspect of these sessions, please drop me an email and I'll pass it on to the appropriate person in my team.</p>

<p>Enjoy! :-)</p>
