<p>On the theme of the Ribbon, whose API in AutoCAD we introduced in <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2008/04/the-new-ribbonb.html">this previous post</a>...</p>

<p>The other day I came across <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jensenh/archive/2008/03/12/the-story-of-the-ribbon.aspx" target="_blank">this interesting post</a>, which talks about the design history culminating in the Office 2007 ribbon. The post focuses on product design rather than programming, but it's very interesting to see the story behind this significant user-interface innovation, especially as Autodesk has adopted the ribbon paradigm in AutoCAD 2009.</p>
