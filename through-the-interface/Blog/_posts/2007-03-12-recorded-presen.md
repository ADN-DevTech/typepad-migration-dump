<p>It's been quite a week... I was attending Autodesk's annual One Team Conference in Las Vegas, and had a number of meetings before, during and afterwards (hence my inability to make any posts whatsoever since Sunday). It was hectic, but a great event - the highlight for me was the keynote address on Wednesday by none other that Bill Clinton, the 42nd President of the United States! Wow.</p>

<p>Anyway, late last week it came to my attention that <a href="http://download.autodesk.com/media/adn/AdskCompTech.html">a presentation of mine</a> had made it onto one of Autodesk's public websites. Thanks to posts on <a href="http://jtbworld.blogspot.com/2007/03/kean-walmsley-presentation-on-autodesk.html">Jimmy Bergmark's</a> and <a href="http://dwf.blogs.com/beyond_the_paper/2007/03/kean_walmsley_a.html">Scott Sheppard's</a> blogs for bringing it to my attention (I knew it was happening, I just didn't know when).</p>

<p>It's actually another in the series of presentations I mentioned in <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2007/02/autocad_2008_64.html">this previous post</a>. The material is quite condensed - the whole presentation lasts just over 20 minutes, including a number of demos. Those of you I haven't met in person might find it interesting, just to find out what my voice sounds like (aside from the interesting content, that is! :-).</p>
