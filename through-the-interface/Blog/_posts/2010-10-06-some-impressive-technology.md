<p>Just back from a great little break: yesterday we drove across and spent the day at the <a href="http://www.verkehrshaus.ch/en/" target="_blank">Swiss Museum of Transport</a> in Luzern (more on that in a bit), before having dinner at the <a href="http://www.rathausbrauerei.ch/" target="_blank">Rathaus Brauerie</a> opposite the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kapellbr%C3%BCcke" target="_blank">Kapellbrucke</a>. Then we spent the night at the <a href="http://www.bellevue-luzern.ch/" target="_blank">Hotel Bellevue</a>, a very friendly hotel near the edge of Lake Luzern, and today headed across to <a href="http://www.ballenberg.ch/en/Welcome" target="_blank">Ballenberg</a> – with its amazing historical view of Swiss life – before arriving home this evening.</p>  <p>All in all a great deal of fun crammed into two short days. One of the highlights for me was a special exhibit at the Transport Museum: live demos of the <a href="http://www.menzimuck.com/en/produktegruppe/typen/a111.html" target="_blank">Menzi Muck A91 4x4 Plus excavator</a>. Now don’t get me wrong – I’m far from being a huge fan of construction equipment, although I’ve been known to watch the odd episode of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_the_Builder" target="_blank">Bob the Builder</a> with my kids ;-) - but this is something special.</p>  <p>To get a feel for what I mean, check out one or both of these two videos I shot of the A91 4x4 Plus in action with my Flip (apologies for the amateurish camera-work). I don’t know whether to describe the driver – who I chatted to after the last demo, as I was close to being the only spectator by that time of the day – as a driver, acrobat or artist. He used the same core “choreography” across the various demos, but I recorded the first from opposite the speaker (therefore catching more of the music and narrative) and the second from next to it (therefore catching almost none of it).</p>  <p><object width="480" height="385"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/FAJeX5sLQ00?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/FAJeX5sLQ00?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="480" height="385"></embed></object></p>  <p><object width="480" height="385"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/M837p2KjG34?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/M837p2KjG34?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="480" height="385"></embed></object></p>  <p>Some of the above positions really made me think that perhaps we’re not so far off having <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mecha" target="_blank">mecha</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powered_exoskeletons_in_fiction" target="_blank">powered exoskeletons</a> such as those seen in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatar_(2009_film)" target="_blank">Avatar</a>.</p>  <p>I took about 250 photos of this incredible vehicle and uploaded them to <a href="http//photosynth.net" target="_blank">Photosynth</a>:</p>  <p><iframe height="288" src="http://photosynth.net/embed.aspx?cid=6468bbba-cc37-499e-92b5-ae9f5a4fd438&amp;delayLoad=true&amp;slideShowPlaying=false" frameborder="0" width="480"></iframe></p>  <p>I then used this month’s <a href="http://labs.autodesk.com/utilities/ADN_plugins/" target="_blank">Plugin of the Month</a>, <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2010/10/octobers-plugin-of-the-month-browsephotosynth-for-autocad.html" target="_blank">BrowsePhotosynth for AutoCAD</a>, to pull the resultant point cloud into AutoCAD 2011:</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201348803ecf2970c-pi"><img style="border-right-width: 0px; margin: 20px auto; display: block; float: none; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" title="Menzi Muck in AutoCAD 2011" border="0" alt="Menzi Muck in AutoCAD 2011" src="/assets/image_443176.jpg" width="444" height="450" /></a>I chose a relatively flattering angle for the above shot. I didn’t upload many overall pictures, showing how the various parts connected, so I think I may need to try again with some from my other camera (my digital SLR had the zoom lens on it, and I was too lazy to swap). All good fun, though! :-)</p>  <p><strong><em>Update</em></strong></p>  <p>I’ve just received an email from Michael Marx at <a href="http://westcam.at/default_en.asp" target="_blank">Westcam</a> telling me that Menzi Muck made use of <a href="http://autodesk.com/inventor" target="_blank">Autodesk Inventor</a> to design this product (something I wasn’t aware of, but am very happy to hear :-). If I get any further information I’ll post a follow-up. Thanks, Michael!</p>
