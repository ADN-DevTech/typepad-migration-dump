<p>In a <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2023/10/come-and-see-from-steps-to-stories-in-toronto-and-las-vegas.html">recent post</a> I talked about “<a href="https://thebentway.ca/event/from-steps-to-stories/">From Steps to Stories</a>”, the exhibit we’re showing in Toronto, hosted by our partners at <a href="https://thebentway.ca/">The Bentway</a>. In that post I promised I’d share more details, nearer the event, and, well, here we are.</p>
<p>We recently published a video showing more details about the project. There will be a longer video produced, once we’ve captured footage of the exhibit in Toronto, but this one tells the story behind the project quite nicely in just 2 minutes.</p>

<p>Beyond that, I thought I’d share a couple of shots that give a sense of what to expect from the exhibit. Here’s a still extracted from a video showing a test of playing 360 video on an array of six vertically mounted 55” monitors. You can actually only see four of the screens here, but it gives a sense for how it will work.</p>

<p>Here’s a quick image of a view from the video with the segmentation map overlaid. A big piece of the exhibit will be around weaving in quantitative data that’s extracted using computer vision as well as qualitative data that’s provided by the participants of our “walkshops&quot;.</p>

<p>If you’re coming to Autodesk University 2023 in Las Vegas, stop by our booth - #1222 - to experience the exhibit and to help capture more data about AU itself!</p>
