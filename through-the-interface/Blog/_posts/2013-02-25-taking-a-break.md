<p>I’m up in the Alps enjoying a week of skiing (in my case snowboarding) with my family. Swiss schools have a very civilised “ski week” where the kids get a week off school sometime between the Christmas and Easter holidays – the specific week varies from canton to canton and this week happens to be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canton_of_Neuch%C3%A2tel" target="_blank">Neuchâtel</a>’s (it extends the usual March 1st holiday celebrating <a href="http://www.swisscommunity.org/en/explore-switzerland/neuchatel/history-tradition" target="_blank">the 1848 revolution leading to Neuchâtel joining the Swiss confederation</a>) – so I decided to take the week off to be with them.</p>  <p>Here’s a quick snap I took this morning before heading up to the slopes:</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2017c3716437e970b-pi" target="_blank"><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 20px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="View from the apartment" border="0" alt="View from the apartment" src="/assets/image_304251.jpg" width="460" height="313" /></a></p>  <p>I’ll be online from time to time during the week (like now, for instance), but we’ll see whether I get around to writing any more posts. I’ll do my best to respond to comments, at least.</p>
