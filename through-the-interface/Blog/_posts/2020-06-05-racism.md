<p>Today is a company-wide holiday at Autodesk, so I’m not going to blog about work.</p>
<p>I will say this, though: the fact the company has recognized people are working longer hours and are starting to feel “Zoomed out” – and is trying to help manage this by giving everyone two Fridays off in June – is outstanding. I’ve been greatly impressed by the humanity and compassion shown by our leadership during these times.</p>
<p>Anyway, on to the topic for the day. This isn’t an easy topic for me to write about – I’m much happier dealing with things related to work and technology, trust me – but recent events have sickened me to the point that I feel the need to break my usual rule of avoiding posting about deeply personal topics. If reading this makes you as uncomfortable as it did for me to write it, feel free to skip it: I’ll be back on safer ground in the next post, no doubt.</p>
<p>Some of you may have listened to one or other of the podcasts that I’ve participated in, recently. <a href="http://archgyan.com/kean-walmsley-ag-42/" target="_blank">The first</a> recorded was back in March for <a href="http://archgyan.com/" target="_blank">Archgyan</a>, while <a href="http://gettingsimple.com/kean-walmsley" target="_blank">the second</a> was recorded in May for <a href="http://gettingsimple.com" target="_blank">Getting Simple</a>. In both of these I refer to my Indian heritage: my mother was born and raised in India, and she met my father when he was on a professional placement in Bangalore during the 1960s. (He was working for Monotype who were building printing machines there at the time.)</p>
<p>By a twist of fate – or politics, really, as it was due to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indira_Gandhi" target="_blank">Indira Gandhi</a>’s government’s imposition of quotas for foreign workers – my parents ended up having to move “back” to the UK. It was never in their plan, but circumstances led to it happening anyway.</p>
<p>They settled in Downham Market, a small town in the East of England: the town where my paternal grandparents lived, and where my grandfather ran a printing shop. And when I say printing, this was “real” mechanical printing, with the smell of grease and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swarfega" target="_blank">Swarfega</a> everywhere. When my grandfather passed away from leukemia my father took over the business. I was too young to understand anything much of what happened, but I can only assume with hindsight that the business was doomed for various progress-related reasons. My Dad later pivoted towards graphic design: he was a great designer, but how many great designers do East Anglian market towns need? He followed his passion for design until he passed away in 2004, but it was never a booming business.</p><p>Here’s a photo of the local playgroup from my early years in Downham Market. You should be able to spot me pretty easily (in the middle at the bottom).</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20263e94e79a0200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="452" height="316" title="Clackclose Playgroup" style="margin: 30px auto; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Clackclose Playgroup" src="/assets/image_411783.jpg" border="0"></a></p>
<p>I’m the middle of three siblings: I have an older sister – who was born in Bangalore, much like my eldest son was – and a younger brother. Of the three I’ve always had the darkest skin. These days most people assume I have Mediterranean (or sometimes Persian) heritage, but back then – in a small town where everyone knew you and your family – it was absolutely clear to people that I was a “Paki”. (Don’t get caught up on the fact that India and Pakistan are different countries – for anyone growing up in the UK in the 70s or 80s, they’ll be all-too-familiar with the use of this word… I hate to draw parallels, but in many ways this is the British Asian community’s N word.)</p>
<p>There were so few non-white people in the area, at the time. There was a Chinese family running the local takeaway, but that was about it. I grew up feeling isolated, and it’s not an exaggeration to say that I was bullied (mostly verbally, but also sometimes physically) pretty much on a daily basis. If it was just kids “being kids” it would be one thing, but I also got remarks from adults, too. Stupid adults, for sure, but adults nonetheless.</p>
<p>I was always escaping, as a child (and still to some degree, today): computers, role playing games, science fiction and fantasy novels. These were the places I felt safe from judgment and hate. Would I have ended up in this industry without having felt constant alienation, as a child? Maybe. But it definitely influenced my life direction.</p>
<p>I said that I was more visibly Indian than my siblings, but that wasn’t much of a protection for them: they were clearly considered different, too, as everyone knew we were from the same family and my mother was “foreign”. My Dad was completely colour blind when it came to race, which didn’t actually make it easier for us: I found it very hard (actually impossible) to discuss racism with my parents. I was lucky to have had some really good friends, growing up: without them I don’t know what I’d have done. It’s not as though we discussed race between us, either, but I knew they were there for me if I needed them.</p>
<p>If I felt isolated, growing up, I can only imagine what it must have been like for my Mum. She is one the most amazing women I’ve ever met: having grown up in an environment where staff cleaned the house and cooked meals (families didn’t need significant wealth for this to be the case in India in the 50s and 60s), she ended up in a rural part of the UK, having to look after three young kids with very little support from anyone. I know my sense of isolation is a mere shadow of what she must have experienced, herself. We didn’t have much money, but my parents were solidly middle-class: we had lots of books around and the kids were encouraged to participate in intellectual discussions at the dinner table. I know that doors closed in my Mum’s face wherever she went, but she later went back to University (when we kids were old enough to manage ourselves), found work as a journalist and went on to organize cultural events in Birmingham and Cardiff. When she retired she was Head of Diversity at BBC Wales.</p>
<p>Of course things changed for me when I moved away to University, which was a much more cosmopolitan environment. A funny side-note: on the forms I filled out during my University application I remember writing “Anglo-Indian” when asked for my race. When I arrived and found my accommodation (most first-year students had a room on-campus) it was in a block reserved for people of South Asian origin (mostly foreign students). This was actually quite shocking, for me, as at the time – and I know how strange this must sound – I just wasn’t used to being around people of Asian origin.</p>
<p>In fairness, I rarely experienced direct racism after that point. One time that sticks in my mind is when I went across to North Wales with the University field hockey team, and we found ourselves in a local, small town pub, playing pool. Someone in a Bangor Rugby Club polo shirt started chatting to us and asked where we were from. I said “Kent”. He said “You’re not from Kent”. (At this point I thought, “Here we go…”) I said “No, I’m from Norfolk.” He replied, predictably enough “You’re not from Norfolk.” Finally I said “Well, my Mum’s from India, if that’s what you mean.” And he said, quite calmly, “And your Dad’s English? Ah, right. We haven’t been invaded yet.”</p>
<p>While racism was a near-constant part of my younger life, I can’t claim to have been disadvantaged by it professionally. While I know in the deepest part of me what it feels like to receive such hate, I can’t claim to know what it’s like to be constantly disadvantaged by society based on the colour of my skin. I’ve had plenty of opportunities in my life, and if anything my formative experiences – good and bad – have pushed me onwards. So no, I’m really not complaining about my personal situation – my life has never been threatened because of racism, and I don’t believe I’ve missed out on a professional opportunity because of it, either – but the situation stateside has affected me deeply, as do any issues related to the cancer that is racism.</p><p>I’ve now lived and worked in the UK, France, Switzerland, the USA and India: none of these places is without problems, but I will say that I’ve always struggled with the reality of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_dream" target="_blank">American Dream</a>. The noble idea that “if you work hard enough, you will succeed” has an unfortunate but inevitable corollary: “if you haven’t succeeded then you haven’t worked hard enough.” The US – but not only the US – has structural issues in its society that mean opportunities are not evenly distributed. This isn’t news to anyone – especially Black Americans – but the extent of the problem has been brought more into focus by CORVID-19 mortality statistics and recent cases of police brutality.</p><p>I really do hope that the current situation will lead to us being more aware of these structural issues and working to address them. Many high-tech companies struggle with diversity: Autodesk is certainly one of them, but I see the company is working hard to improve the situation. I hope I can play a role in this: I’m no longer a hiring manager, but I do want to contribute in some way. We’ll see what’s possible.</p>
