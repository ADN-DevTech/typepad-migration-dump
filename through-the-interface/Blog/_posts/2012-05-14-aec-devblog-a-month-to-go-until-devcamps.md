<p>As announced <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2012/04/announcing-devblogs-from-adn.html" target="_blank">previously on this blog</a>, the Autodesk Developer Network (ADN) team is in the process of launching a series of DevBlogs, publishing material publicly that would previously only have been made available to ADN members. I see some fantastic material being posted there: more than I can keep up with, personally, but I expect that will settle down once the team has created posts from the bulk of the DevNotes published on the ADN web-site.</p>  <p>Following the availability of those for <a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/autocad" target="_blank">AutoCAD</a> and <a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/infrastructure" target="_blank">Infrastructure Modeling</a>, I’m pleased to announce <a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/aec" target="_blank">the AEC DevBlog</a> is now live.</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20168eb7d9cb5970c-pi" target="_blank"><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; margin: 20px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="AEC DevBlog" border="0" alt="AEC DevBlog" src="/assets/image_124812.jpg" width="398" height="82" /></a></p>  <p>If you’re [considering] developing for Revit, Navisworks or our other AEC and BIM technologies, be sure to bookmark this page and visit often.</p>  <p>On a somewhat related note, I also wanted to remind you that there’s now only a month to go until <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2012/04/devcamps-reminder.html" target="_blank">this year’s AEC and Manufacturing DevCamps</a>. If you’ve held off from registering, be sure to do so soon: time is running out!</p>
