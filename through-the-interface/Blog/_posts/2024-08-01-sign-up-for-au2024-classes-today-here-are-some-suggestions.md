<p>The <a href="https://conferences.autodesk.com/flow/autodesk/au2024/sessioncatalog/page/inperson" rel="noopener" target="_blank">class catalog for Autodesk University 2024</a> has been live for a week or two already, with attendees being able to bookmark sessions ahead of the ability to enroll fully. Well, today’s the day that enrollment opens properly, so have at it! Classes often fill up quickly, so doing it sooner can certainly be better than waiting.</p>
<p>I also have a few suggestions if you’re at a loss for what to choose. These are all classes that I or my research team are involved in, of course. That’s just how things work around here. :-)</p>

<p>It turns out there’s one per day of AU. Let’s go through them in chronological order.</p>
<p><strong>Tuesday’s class is about <a href="https://conferences.autodesk.com/flow/autodesk/au2024/sessioncatalog/page/inperson/session/1714403202332001pGmI" rel="noopener" target="_blank">extending Forma.</a></strong></p>
<p>I'll be joining Håvard Høiby on stage to talk about how Forma's powerful extension system can be used to deliver compelling analysis capabilities to its users.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Autodesk Forma software is Autodesk’s cloud-based solution for early-stage planning and design. Aside from having a rich, evolving feature set, Autodesk Forma is also a platform: It exposes a powerful set of APIs that allow you to extend the core functionality with custom data and analyses. This session will look at the various ways to extend Autodesk Forma, with a particular focus on how Autodesk Research has created a voxel-based analysis extension using the embedded views software development kit (SDK).</em></p>

<p><strong>Wednesday’s theater talk is about <a href="https://conferences.autodesk.com/flow/autodesk/au2024/sessioncatalog/page/inperson/session/1719601698805001Biuf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">capturing the human experience</a>.</strong></p>
<p>Ray Wang will be talking about our project with <a href="https://www.research.autodesk.com/projects/bentway/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Bentway</a> during this session on health &amp; human impact in modern design.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Explore industry trends and pioneering ideas from leaders in the Design and Make community. Theater sessions feature short talks on critical themes, from AI and the future of work to business resiliency in a time of digital transformation. Walk-ins are welcome.</em></p>
<p><em>From better hospitals to healthier neighborhoods, learn how we can put people first in the design process and evaluate potential buildings and infrastructure according to experiential metrics. It’s all about making spatial, social, and emotional data indicators part of the design methodology and elevating the user experience while improving environmental impact.</em></p>

<p><strong>Thursday’s workshop is about <a href="https://conferences.autodesk.com/flow/autodesk/au2024/sessioncatalog/page/inperson/session/1718986942646001QMlA" rel="noopener" target="_blank">AI and human factors</a>.</strong></p>
<p>Dagmara Szkurlat and Dianne Gault will be leading this workshop to explore how AI can be used to better consider human factors during the design process. I’ll definitely be there to help facilitate this one.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Could AI help us better predict and simulate that most unpredictable element of design - humans and their behavior?</em></p>
<p><em>At Autodesk Research, we believe so. In this workshop we’ll share with you the trends and prototypes behind our conviction. We will then ask for your help in co-creating a vision of the future of human factors design tools and workflows. We’ll discuss your current critical pain points and blockers and start imagining potential solutions together. Our goal is for you to walk away inspired by the new possibilities AI opens up for human-centric design and having forged new connections with like-minded professionals from various industries.</em></p>
<p><em>So, no matter your industry or background, if you are passionate about and directly consider human factors in your design processes, please join us!</em></p>
