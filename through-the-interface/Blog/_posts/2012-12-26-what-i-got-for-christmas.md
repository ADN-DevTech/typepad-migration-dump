<p>One of the ulterior motives (although you might really consider it a mere side benefit) for <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2012/12/zooming-panning-and-orbiting-the-current-autocad-view-using-net.html" target="_blank">my recent trip back to the UK</a> was to pick up the Christmas presents I’d bought for myself on behalf of my wife and kids. :-)</p>
<p>The first – one of <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/archives/2180" target="_blank">the new Raspberry Pi Model B’s with 512 MB of memory</a> – could have been ordered from Switzerland, but I was a bit frustrated at the mark-up added by the local reseller (the previous one I bought from the UK and had shipped directly here from China… that no longer seems possible now that there’s an official local channel).</p>
<p>Here are my two Raspberry Pi devices side-by-side with their stunning mix &amp; match <a href="http://petrockblog.wordpress.com/2012/08/07/petrockblock-pie-a-gaming-raspberry-pi-case" target="_blank">PetRockBlock cases</a>:</p>
<p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2017c34d0c0a5970b-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="My two Raspberry Pis" border="0" height="311" src="/assets/image_382277.jpg" style="background-image: none; margin: 20px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="My two Raspberry Pis" width="464" /></a></p>
<p>The benefit from this new device is clearly incremental, but I’m hoping it’ll allow <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2012/10/retro-computing-with-the-raspberry-pi.html" target="_blank">my retro gaming console</a> to run PSX games and possibly even <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2012/10/creating-a-face-recognising-security-cam-with-a-raspberry-pi-part-4.html" target="_blank">the Facecam</a> to perform more reliably (I have doubts it’ll help very much in either area, but we’ll see).</p>
<p>The other part of my present is altogether different, in that it will really let me get involved in something that’s brand new (to me, at least): I ordered an <a href="http://www.oomlout.co.uk/arduino-experimentation-kit-ardx-p-183.html" target="_blank">Arduino Experimentation Kit (ARDX)</a> from <a href="http://oomlout.co.uk" target="_blank">oomlout.co.uk</a> (love that name :-).</p>
<p>I bought the one from Oomlout largely on the strength of <a href="http://aaroneiche.com/2009/07/16/arduino-starter-rundown-part-2" target="_blank">this helpful review</a>, although as it’s a few years old I’m sure there are other alternatives now available.</p>
<p>Here’s the kit from the outside:</p>
<p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2017c34d0c152970b-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="My Arduino Starter Kit" border="0" height="289" src="/assets/image_791475.jpg" style="background-image: none; margin: 20px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="My Arduino Starter Kit" width="464" /></a></p>
<p>And here are the contents of the box:</p>
<p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2017c34d0c26a970b-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="The contents of the kit" border="0" height="311" src="/assets/image_918324.jpg" style="background-image: none; margin: 20px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="The contents of the kit" width="464" /></a></p>
<p>And, of course, the <a href="http://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/arduinoBoardUno" target="_blank">Arduino Uno R3 microcontroller</a>, itself:</p>
<p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2017d3f00c735970c-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="The contained Arduino Uno R3" border="0" height="311" src="/assets/image_79058.jpg" style="background-image: none; margin: 20px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="The contained Arduino Uno R3" width="464" /></a></p>
<p>Once I get my head around Arduino projects, I’m going to see about taking it down to an even simpler level: I backed the <a href="http://digistump.com" target="_blank">Digispark</a> project on <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/digistump/digispark-the-tiny-arduino-enabled-usb-dev-board" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a> and so have a couple of these cute little Arduino-compatible chips about to show up through the post. I suspect I have a long way to go before I get to start using them, though. </p>
<p>It’s looking as though 2013 is shaping up to be a fun year!</p>
