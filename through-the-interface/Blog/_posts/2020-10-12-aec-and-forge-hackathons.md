<p>If you enjoy hackathons – and have the time to spare – then you could spend the next month hacking, should you so desire!</p><p>Last Friday the 2nd online <a href="https://www.hackaec.com/" target="_blank">AEC Hackathon</a> kicked off with its <a href="https://autodesk.blogs.com/between_the_lines/2020/10/aec-hackathon-online-20-attend-the-opening-and-lightning-rounds.html" target="_blank">lightning round</a>.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2026bde9ad18f200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="316" title="AEC Hackathon Online v2" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="AEC Hackathon Online v2" src="/assets/image_538847.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>The event is about now a week in: it started officially on October 5th, but it really only started in earnest with Friday’s kick-off and lightning round. The event will run <strong>until October 25th</strong>, so you still have time to find or build a team and participate.</p><p>It was fun listening to the <a href="https://us02web.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_b4nVhXYwQ4m4iQjqxmxMhA" target="_blank">recording of the lightning round</a> – which was short and sweet, at just under a quarter of an hour – as there are some teams planning on doing some really cool hacks. And yes, I admit that hearing the first team say they wanted to build “something like <a href="https://dasher360.com" target="_blank">Project Dasher</a>” made me feel good (and also that we’re on&nbsp; the right track). There are several teams focused on Forge, so this could be a great opportunity for you to either show what you know or perhaps to cut your teeth on a project that’s a little more “out there” than what you’re used to working on. <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/aec-hackathon-online-v2-tickets-114089619122" target="_blank">Get your ticket(s) here!</a></p><p>If this hackathon isn’t enough to keep you happy – or you can’t join for scheduling reasons – then there’s another coming very soon.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20263e96d7da8200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="250" title="Forge Hackathon" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Forge Hackathon" src="/assets/image_148800.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p><a href="https://forge.autodesk.com/blog/join-forge-hackathon-autodesk-university-2020" target="_blank">The Forge team have a pre-AU hackathon</a> running from <strong>November 8th to 13th</strong>. You can already <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/autodesk-university-forge-hackathon-registration-124124705335" target="_blank">register for free</a> today, and the first 100 people to sign up get free swag, so there’s really no reason not to do so.</p><p>Beyond swag, there are a number of interesting prize categories, such as “<em>Best data visualization application</em>”, “<em>Most innovative Digital Twin application</em>” and even “<em>Best 3D game application</em>”. The winners will be announced during a special showcase at <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/autodesk-university/conference/overview" target="_blank">AU 2020</a>, which is an exciting opportunity in and of itself.</p><p>Oh, and if you need a little inspiration on the "digital twin” side of things – for either hackathon – then be sure to <a href="https://keanw.com/iot" target="_blank">check out some of the relevant posts from this blog</a>.</p>
