<p>On Friday morning I was up before dawn to head across to Italy for the first of 12 lectures for <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2025/02/a-course-on-neuroscience-and-design-at-polidesign.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a course I&#39;m taking on Neuroscience and Design</a>.<a href="/assets/image_685547.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Up too early." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_685547.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Up too early" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>The first of my trains arrived out of the fog to take me to the nearby town of Ins.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_675382.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Local train to Ins." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_675382.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Local train to Ins" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>The fast train from Neuchatel stops in Ins but not my local station, so from here you can get to Bern in about 20 minutes. I wasn’t thrilled about waiting in Ins for 15 minutes at this time of day, but honestly it was quite magical.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_268445.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Waiting in Ins." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_268445.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Waiting in Ins" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Dawn was breaking by the time I arrived in Bern.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_480417.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Arriving in Bern." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_480417.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Arriving in Bern" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>From Bern it’s a straight shot through to Milan in a little over 3 hours.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_564923.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Waiting for the train to Milano." border="0" height="500" src="/assets/image_564923.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Waiting for the train to Milano" width="375" /></a></p>
<p>Passing through the Bernese Oberland the sun finally showed up over the peaks.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_637322.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Sun poking over the Alps." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_637322.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Sun poking over the Alps" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Arriving in Milan I was feeling surprisingly fresh.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_808380.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Arriving in Milano." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_808380.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Arriving in Milano" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>I’d arranged to meet with Viola Cambié from Lombardini22 and a colleague of hers, Ash, who I hadn’t met before. We met by the “Apple Made Whole Again” sculpture, just outside Milano Centrale train station.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_844036.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Waiting by the apple." border="0" height="500" src="/assets/image_844036.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Waiting by the apple" width="375" /></a></p>
<p>We walked to a nearby pizzeria where I was served a really large (but good) truffle pizza.<a href="/assets/image_56772.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Lunch with Ash and Viola." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_56772.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Lunch with Ash and Viola" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Believe it or not there was a plate somewhere beneath it. It was an interesting challenge to cut and eat a pizza that overflows its plate by such a margin.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_325447.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Family size pizza." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_325447.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Family size pizza" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>With a (probably excessively) full belly, I took the M3 line of the Milan metro to Dergano, where I walked the last 20 minutes to the Design Department campus of the Politecnico di Milano. It certainly helped burn off some of the pizza.</p>

<p>It took me a while to find the right room...</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_655391.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" height="500" src="/assets/image_655391.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Inside B2" width="375" /></a></p>
<p>… but I arrived basically on time. And it seems lectures in Italy often start late, so I ended up having some time to settle in.</p>
<p>The main lecturer for this course is Professor Davide Ruzzon, who will be joined by a number of guest lecturers over the next 3 months.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_687193.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Davide Ruzzon introducing things." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_687193.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Davide Ruzzon introducing things" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>This initial session was primarily for the attendees to meet one another and get an overview of the course.</p>
<p>There was a very interesting Q&amp;A with <a href="https://www.whatdesigncando.net/team" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Sarah Robinson (in-person) and Sarah Williams Goldhagen (online)</a>, makers of a fantastic short film called “What Design Can Do”, which could almost be used as a mission statement for my team&#39;s work.<a href="/assets/image_391035.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Sarah and Sarah." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_391035.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Sarah and Sarah" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>I really wanted to be able to embed the film in this post, but that capability isn’t yet enabled. Here’s a screenshot and you can <a href="https://www.whatdesigncando.net/film" rel="noopener" target="_blank">click here to watch this 20-minute gem of a movie.</a></p>

<p>We had a nice aperitif at the end of the class, which gave a good opportunity to connect with people, and from there I headed back to my hotel near the main station.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_245039.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Metro back to the centre." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_245039.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Metro back to the centre" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>I was still digesting my lunch, and so ended up going out for a very light dinner. When in Italy and all that.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_947817.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Light dinner." border="0" height="500" src="/assets/image_947817.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Light dinner" width="375" /></a></p>
<p>My train home was scheduled for 7:10am on Saturday. It was raining when I left the hotel.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_714737.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Leaving the hotel." border="0" height="500" src="/assets/image_714737.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Leaving the hotel" width="375" /></a></p>
<p>I very nearly got on a train for Zurich. Luckily I realised that I needed to take *another train to Switzerland that was scheduled for exactly the same time* before boarding it.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_219470.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Train to Zurich." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_219470.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Train to Zurich" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>That seems like a really strange scheduling decision, but there you go.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_601974.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Train to Basel." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_601974.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Train to Basel" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>I did catch the right one, and arrived back in Switzerland with enough time to spend a couple of hours of the afternoon snowboarding. Yay!</p>
<p>The rest of the course is virtual, with the exception of the very last session which will be in-person at the Biennale in Venice. Something I’m really looking forward to.</p>
