<p>I had a really excellent day, yesterday. I’d flown in from Munich, the night before, and stayed at the charming <a href="http://www.zumgutenglueck.ch/start-en.html" target="_blank">Zum Guten Glück</a> restaurant/hostel in Zurich. After collecting my key I met <a href="https://twitter.com/AboutThisLater" target="_blank">Rob Morgan</a> – who was also due to speak at the next day’s <a href="http://expandingimmersivedesign.ch/" target="_blank">Expanding Immersive Design conference</a> – and we headed out for the pre-arranged dinner together. After a slight Uber-snafu (there are two restaurants named Markthalle in Zurich – who knew?) we found the right place and had a very nice meal, enjoying highly engaging discussions with our fellow speakers.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning – rather than heading directly across to the <a href="https://www.zhdk.ch/" target="_blank">ZHdK</a> for the conference – I skipped the beginning to pop over for a quick meeting at ABB’s headquarters in Oerlikon.</p>

<p>While there, I simply couldn’t resist the opportunity to film the virtual <a href="http://new.abb.com/products/robotics/industrial-robots/irb-6620" target="_blank">IRB 6620</a> dancing in the lobby of its spiritual home:</p>

<p>After making it back across to the ZHdK, I was very happy with how the event went. My presentation seemed to go well – I demo’ed <a href="https://vrok.it" target="_blank">Vrok-It</a> to perhaps 150 attendees – and I really learned a lot from the other speakers. I had to cut the evening a little short to make it back in time for my eldest son’s parents’ evening, which was a shame: it was a great event which also had a very different audience than I’m used to. All in all it was a very stimulating experience.</p>
<p>I’m now playing serious catch-up with my <a href="https://au.autodesk.com" target="_blank">AU 2016</a> preparations, though. I’m overdue on the deadline for my class handout, so I expect chunks of my weekend will be spent working on that. Hopefully I’ll manage to get things back under control during the course of next week, but we’ll see.</p>
