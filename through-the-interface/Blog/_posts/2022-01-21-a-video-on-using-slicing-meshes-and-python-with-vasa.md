<p>Fancy a nice slice of VASA to finish your week? Luckily Rhys Goldstein is here with Part 4 in <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5DhpoI3HKE99RFSWsxsLVPHGqxQ5TVuc" target="_blank">his video series introducing VASA features</a>.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202942f948a29200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="313" title="VASA demo part 4" style="margin: 30px auto; float: none; display: block;" alt="VASA demo part 4" src="/assets/image_114525.jpg"></a></p><p>In this episode, Rhys talks about using slicing functions with voxel models, how to iterate through voxel models using Python, as well as a number of nodes that help you work with meshes inside Dynamo (and VASA). He also covers a couple of techniques that allow you to export voxel models to Dynamo geometry, and even navigates through the shell of an exported voxel model to show you what it looks like from the inside. Super-cool stuff.</p><p align="center"><br></p><p align="center"><iframe width="500" height="283" title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xsN3sU2HF24" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"></iframe></p><p><br></p><p>Next week is a big week in Autodesk history, so watch this space for some historic Autodesk fun!</p>
