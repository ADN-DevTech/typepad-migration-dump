<p>It’s been a busy couple of months since getting back from <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/round-the-world" target="_blank">our big trip</a> (which, while incredible at many levels, was in itself not really a relaxing experience, all things considered). So in some ways it feels like a good time to take a break, especially as the kids have the week off school.</p><p>We took the chance to head up to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernese_Highlands" target="_blank">Bernese Oberland</a> for a bit of skiing and snowboarding, as we often do at this time of year. I’m working a bit in the mornings and the evenings – I have a few important projects to work on, at the moment, and so don’t really want to take the full week off – and we’re hitting the slopes in-between. It has been bitterly cold for the first part of the week – largely thanks to the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2018/feb/28/beast-from-the-east-snow-in-pictures" target="_blank">Beast from the East</a> – so we’ve only ended up managing to ski for a couple of hours a day. It’s still lots of fun, though, and always very nice to come home afterwards.</p><p>Anyway – as the projects I’m working on are still under wraps, here are a couple of photos. The first was taken yesterday morning at daybreak – it was a lovely sight to see the sun casting the shadow of the mountains on the sky.</p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b7c9541742970b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="The shadow of mountains cast on the dawn sky" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="The shadow of mountains cast on the dawn sky" src="/assets/image_112602.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>And here’s a quick animation of a Swiss flag blowing in the wind.</p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201bb09f772fc970d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="376" height="500" title="A blowing Swiss flag" style="margin: 30px auto; float: none; display: block;" alt="A blowing Swiss flag" src="/assets/image_89662.jpg"></a></p><p>This is starting to feel like the calm before the storm, as the next few months are going to be quite busy, travel-wise. I’ll try to post something in the next few days about what’s coming down the pike.</p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b7c9541742970b-pi" target="_blank"><br></a></p>
