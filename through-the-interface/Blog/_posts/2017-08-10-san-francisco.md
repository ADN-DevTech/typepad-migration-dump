<p>It’s been really great to be back in the Bay Area. My wife and I lived here from 2000 to 2003 – back when (in retrospect, although it didn’t seem so at the time) it was affordable to do so – and being back here is in many ways like coming home. Old friends have gone to great pains to make us feel welcome: it was fantastic <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2017/08/from-monterey-to-marin-county.html" target="_blank">to stay briefly up in Novato</a> – taking advantage of the weather in Marin County – and our time in San Francisco itself has been excellent, if a little on the cool side.</p><p>We arrived in the city on Thursday night: most of Friday ended up being spent emptying the rental car of the bits and pieces accrued over the prior 3 weeks, followed by a valiant attempt at not overwhelming our host’s apartment with said bits and pieces. It was also an opportunity to catch up on the writing of blog posts (both mine and <a href="http://walmsley.ch" target="_blank">my family’s</a>), as well as a bit of schoolwork for the kids.</p><p>On Friday evening we headed up to Napa, where Jim and Mary Quanci hosted us for the weekend. Jim, Mary and Elise (our host in SF) organised a fantastic BBQ that a whole load of old friends managed to attend.</p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b7c9145837970b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="461" height="281" title="Catching up with old friends" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Catching up with old friends" src="/assets/image_163315.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>On the way back down to the city, on Sunday, we stopped by Richmond to help with some repairs on (and then to enjoy) Jim’s boat. To be clear: I am pretty much the least capable sailor on the planet, but I was able to help “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grinder_(sailing_position)" target="_blank">grind</a>” Jim up to the top of the mast so that he could take care of business.</p><p>Since Sunday evening we’ve been hanging out properly in SF: my wife and kids have been visiting the city while I caught up with colleagues in our 1 Market Street office. A highlight from Wednesday was a tour of the Autodesk Gallery, where my kids could see firsthand some of the amazing things our customers create. A huge thanks to JJ Stott for taking the time to show us all around!</p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201bb09b78db6970d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="281" title="The Shanghai Tower at 1 Market" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="The Shanghai Tower at 1 Market" src="/assets/image_744915.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201bb09b78dba970d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="281" title="LEGO, and lots of it" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="LEGO, and lots of it" src="/assets/image_401940.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b7c9145844970b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="281" height="500" title="In the Gallery's Maker area" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="In the Gallery's Maker area" src="/assets/image_225249.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>It was especially cool to see the <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2017/07/camping.html" target="_blank">BioLite</a> display there. :-)</p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b7c9145849970b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="281" title="The BioLite display" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="The BioLite display" src="/assets/image_191758.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>All things must come to an end, however, and so it was that on Thursday morning we departed from SFO with a heavy heart. It’s long been a dream of ours to visit South America, though, so we’re all excited to see what’s next!</p>
