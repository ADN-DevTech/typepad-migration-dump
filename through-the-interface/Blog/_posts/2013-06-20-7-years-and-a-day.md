<p>Another year has come and gone. I managed to miss the 7-year anniversary of “Through the Interface”: it’s only this morning that I thought to look back and check the day of <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2006/06/welcome.html" target="_blank">the first post</a>, and – sure enough – it was June 19, 2006. I have it in my head that it’s around late June (just as I know the anniversary of my joining Autodesk is sometime in late August), but I still managed to miss it. Ah well.</p>
<p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20192ab5da919970d-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="Geek cake" border="0" height="274" src="/assets/image_479275.jpg" style="background-image: none; margin: 20px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="Geek cake" width="394" /></a></p>
<p>So that’s that. Thanks to all of you who have contributed to the blog, whether via one of the ~7,300 comments on one the 993 posts (which means there’s another milestone coming up within the next few weeks… ;-) or via emails with feedback and suggestions for topics to cover. Keep them all coming!</p>
