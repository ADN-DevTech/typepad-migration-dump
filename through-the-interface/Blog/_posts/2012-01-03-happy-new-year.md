<p>I hope readers of this blog were able to relax over the festive period – I certainly was. :-) I’ll post something more technical, later in the week, but I just thought I’d start the year with a quick greeting post.</p>  <p>On 2012…</p>  <p>I expect 2012 to be a very interesting year for me, personally, as I transition into <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2011/12/moving-on-and-yet-not.html" target="_blank">my new role within the company</a>. I’m certainly excited to see what it brings (I’ll have a better idea of what’s in store within the coming weeks, I expect).</p>  <p>I also expect 2012 to be another interesting year from a technology perspective for Autodesk. There are lots of really interesting things going on in the company, harnessing various emerging (and emerged) industry trends. Be sure to visit the blogs and Labs regularly during the year, as more of this goodness becomes available to customers and developers.</p>  <p>That’s it for now – there’ll be more from me later in the week. May this coming year bring fulfillment of your heart’s – and head’s – desires. :-)</p>
