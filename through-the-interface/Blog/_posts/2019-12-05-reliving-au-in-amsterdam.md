<p>As the festive season is upon us, I’ve decided to start each post with a seasonal photo. Here’s me with a reindeer/dog (reindog?) in the lobby of the hotel we stayed at in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoofddorp" target="_blank">Hoofddorp</a>.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4ce7aa0200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="375" height="500" title="Reindog" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Reindog" src="/assets/image_503670.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>As mentioned in <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2019/12/digitalisation-workshop-at-tudelft.html" target="_blank">the last post</a>, Sander Lijbers made the most of my vague suggestion to meet with a customer or two during my visit to the Netherlands by inviting many of the accounts he manages to a one-day event in our Amsterdam office. Everyone accepted – with some even flying in from the UK – so we had a really good, engaged group!</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4f325ce200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="375" height="500" title="Welcome" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Welcome" src="/assets/image_283858.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Sander had called the event “The Best of Autodesk University 2019” (he’s in Sales, after all ;-) and the idea was to have a less formal repeat of some key topics – particularly related to Generative Design – for customers who weren’t able to make the trip to Las Vegas.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4f325d6200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Getting started" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Getting started" src="/assets/image_169152.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Sander kicked things off with some additional commentary from Ed Briggs.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4ce7aa8200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Attendees" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Attendees" src="/assets/image_394749.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Olly Williamson gave a helpful round-up of the key takewaways from this year’s AU, including the launch of the Autodesk Construction Cloud.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4f325da200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Olly" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Olly" src="/assets/image_975532.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Dieter Vermeulen gave a repeat of one of his ever-popular classes, which laid a really good foundation for the day’s discussions around GD.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4f325df200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Dieter" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Dieter" src="/assets/image_420061.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>We were lucky to have a great presentation by Alex Mortiboys and Giuseppe Dotto from OMA, who discussed their real-world usage of GD in designing the <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/2018/12/28/oma-feyenoord-stadium-rotterdam-football/" target="_blank">63,000-seat Feyenoord Stadium in Rotterdam</a>.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4a553d5200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Alex" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Alex" src="/assets/image_786873.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>It was really fantastic to see how a leading firm is applying these principles on projects, as well as understanding some of the process challenges they’ve had to work through.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4a553dd200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Guiseppe" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Guiseppe" src="/assets/image_852800.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>It was great to have Radu Gidei from the UK’s Dynamo User Group on-stage, talking about projects he’s been involved in and pointing out helpful GD resources.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4f325e5200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Radu" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Radu" src="/assets/image_638246.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Our partner Itannex was present, too, and Simone van Loon managed the process of capturing ideas and insights from attendees as the day progressed.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4f325e9200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Simona" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Simona" src="/assets/image_957822.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Lunch was typically Dutch-style, consisting of sandwiches.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4f325ed200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Food" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Food" src="/assets/image_815141.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>After lunch it was my turn. I started by presenting my main GD-related class from AU2019, which focused on Project Discover and Rediscover.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4f325f1200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Kean" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Kean" src="/assets/image_530120.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>It was nice to be presenting in a more relaxed environment, as it allowed me to dig into details it wasn’t feasible to cover at AU itself.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4ce7ab9200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="MaRS" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="MaRS" src="/assets/image_849930.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>We talked about how the Project Rediscover can be used with Project Refinery, as well as Capturefinery for creating presentation graphics.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4a553fb200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="375" height="500" title="The graph" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="The graph" src="/assets/image_688303.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>I had originally planned to present my second longer AU class on “Advanced Data Visualization using Forge”, but instead decided to use the material for my AU Theater Talk: it was higher level – and more appropriate, given the audience – although I didn’t limit myself to the 12 minutes I had at AU: there was plenty of time to dig into more specifics.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4f325fc200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Dasher" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Dasher" src="/assets/image_43563.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>It was an enjoyable day, and there were lots of really interesting questions from the audience: it’s clear people are engaging with these topics. Many thanks to Sander and team for making it happen!</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4a5540c200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Correlating" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Correlating" src="/assets/image_257484.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>By the time it was over I was happy to head to the airport with Radu, although as we were in separate terminals we didn’t have so much time to hang out.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4ce7ac2200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Plane" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Plane" src="/assets/image_63764.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>By the time I got home – my flight was perfectly on-time, but unfortunately landed at the same time as my hourly train home was leaving – it was around 10pm. I’ve got a few days with my family now (excluding tonight’s Autodesk Switzerland Christmas Dinner) before I head off on Wednesday to India for my last trip of the year.</p>
