<p>Yes, every Floppy Friday’s a good Friday, but today’s really a Good Friday. I hope those of you who wish to – and are able to – are enjoying a nice, long weekend.</p>
<p>In this week’s episode, we look at three games from 1983-4 that were released on a 1985 compilation called <a href="http://www.computinghistory.org.uk/det/43669/10-Mega-Hits/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">10 Mega Hits</a> (all I saw on the floppy was “Mega Disk 2”, which makes sense, as the ten games would probably have been delivered on two cassettes or floppies).</p>

<p>The games are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Pipeline" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Super Pipeline</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trollie_Wallie" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Trollie Wallie</a> and <a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automania" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Automania</a> (once again this last one was only on Italian Wikipedia). It was fun discovering them, although – as usual – I didn’t manage to play for very long before dying.</p>

<p>Super Pipeline and Trollie Wallie were both listed in <a href="http://www.zzap64.co.uk/cgi-bin/displayissue.pl?issue=001&amp;magazine=zzap" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Zzap! 64 Magazine’s first issue</a> from May 1985, in their “Top 64 games for the C64” section. They came in at numbers 29 and 39, respectively.</p>

<p>I’ll probably be posting less frequently over the coming fortnight – as our kids are off school, so I’ll try to take some time off – but I do expect to be around enough to keep this series going without a break.</p>
