<p>A few days ago our friends at <a href="https://www.bim-facility.ch/" target="_blank">BIM Facility AG</a> sent through a new version of the Revit model for the iconic NEST building.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4eb27a4200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="312" title="NEST from the South" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="NEST from the South" src="/assets/image_526602.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>This version is much more complete: it has the award-winning <a href="http://nest-umar.net/" target="_blank">Urban Mining and Recycling Unit</a> modelled, as well as having a significant amount of additional detail (furniture, etc.) elsewhere in the building.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4c6732b200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="312" title="NEST from the East" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="NEST from the East" src="/assets/image_450841.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>The <a href="https://dfabhouse.ch/" target="_blank">DFAB House</a> has also received a makeover, getting more realistic materials, plus the ability to see into its ground floor and robotically-printed supporting wall.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4c67333200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="312" title="Looking at the wooden frame of the DFAB House" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Looking at the wooden frame of the DFAB House" src="/assets/image_696979.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Considering all the hard work the BIM Facility team has put into making this version so much better, we decided to spend some serious time cleaning up the experience inside Dasher 360. We’ve fixed quite a few quirks with the display of the model, especially with regards to floor-by-floor display.</p><p>The quality of the modelling is really outstanding. Navigating through the building in first person mode is impressively realistic (having visited the building many times I can attest to this).</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4eb27b4200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="312" title="Time for a break" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Time for a break" src="/assets/image_944090.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p> Although admittedly there are still pieces of the model that are slightly ahead of reality: you can go inside and check out the area beneath the <a href="https://www.empa.ch/web/nest/hilo" target="_blank">HiLo roof</a>, for instance (which is still under construction).</p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4eb27bc200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="312" title="Looking up at the HiLo roof" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Looking up at the HiLo roof" src="/assets/image_734433.jpg" border="0"></a><p>All the IoT-centric capabilities are still working, of course, and with the changes to the floor-by-floor navigation, the heatmap animations are even more compelling.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4c6733d200d-pi"><img width="500" height="313" title="NEST heatmap" style="margin: 30px auto; float: none; display: block;" alt="NEST heatmap" src="/assets/image_268791.jpg"></a></p><p>There’s no need to take my word for all this, of course: head on over to <a href="https://dasher360.com" target="_blank">Dasher360.com</a> and try it out for yourself (just click “Demo” on the main page to load the NEST model).</p><p>In case you don’t have time to play, but do have time to watch a short video, here’s a recording I just made of “Kiosk Mode” running through some features of this model.</p><p><br></p><p><iframe width="500" height="283" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9WJir6zvzPk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"></iframe></p><p><em><br></em></p><p><em>A big thanks to Matthias Wasem, Miriam Parlati and the rest of the team at BIM Facility who worked on improving this model, as well as to Reto Largo and the team at NEST for their ongoing support for this project.</em></p>
