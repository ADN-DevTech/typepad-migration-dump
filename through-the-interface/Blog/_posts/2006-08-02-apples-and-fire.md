<p>[ <strong>Warning:</strong> this post is largely frivolous and non-technical, so please don't read on if that is likely to bother you. :-) ]</p>

<p>Yesterday was August 1st, the <a href="http://www.myswitzerland.com/en/navpage.cfm?category=Culture&amp;subcat=Customs&amp;id=9011">Swiss National Day</a>. During the afternoon, we (my wife, our 2 year-old son and I) visited my wife's parents at their place <a href="http://map.search.ch/2037%20Montmollin/Serroue.en.html">in the hills just outside Neuchâtel</a>. My father-in-law gave me a fantastic present that I'm yet (but impatient) to play with: an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Newton">Apple Newton</a> in mint-condition.</p>

<p>In the evening we went down to <a href="http://www.surface.ch/ne/neuchatel/saint-blaise/default.htm">St Blaise</a>, on the edge of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Neuch%C3%A2tel">Lake Neuchâtel</a>, to watch the town's annual firework display. The last few weeks have been particularly hot here, but last night was cold and windy.</p>

<p>Anyway, there is a reason for me mentioning all this... last night was my introduction to cubic fireworks. I don't know if that's their proper name, but basically these are fireworks that, on exploding, form a 3D wireframe of a cube. I'd seen cylinders and spheres before, but cubes were new to me (although I checked on the web, and sightings seem to go back to at least the middle of last year).</p>

<p>This got me thinking. If it's possible to make cubes, spheres and cylinders, could it also be possible to make arbitrary 3D models from fireworks? I don't know whether you'd need to combine fireworks or you could make a single one that exploded into a complex 3D form... then you just need to hook up your design system to a rapid prototyping system that creates the fireworks automatically from the model...</p>

<p>... and you end up with the world's largest 3D display, although admittedly with the world's slowest response time. :-)</p>
