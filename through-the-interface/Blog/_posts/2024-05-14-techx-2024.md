<p>In <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2024/05/back-in-las-vegas-for-techx-2024.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my last post</a> I mentioned my trip to Las Vegas for this year's Autodesk-internal TechX event. This post summarizes the whole week, to give a taste for how these events go.</p>
<p>Things started on Sunday evening at the <a href="https://www.rwlasvegas.com/dining/alle-lounge-on-66/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Allē Lounge on 66</a> roof bar at Resorts World, where Autodesk's technical leadership community got together for a welcome reception.<a href="/assets/image_380393.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Chatting at the Tech Leadership Forum welcome event" src="/assets/image_380393.jpg" alt="Chatting at the Tech Leadership Forum welcome event." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>The view was spectacular!<a href="/assets/image_93801.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="The view from Allé 66" src="/assets/image_93801.jpg" alt="The view from Allé 66." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a>I have made a lot of friends at Autodesk, over the years, and TechX is my main chance to reconnect with many of them. I've known Alan Quinton since my days living in the Bay Area (back in 2000-2003), and it's always such a pleasure to catch back up.<a href="/assets/image_96999.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Kean and Alan" src="/assets/image_96999.jpg" alt="Kean and Alan." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>After the reception I got to hang out with more old friends: Tekno, Christer, Brian and Greg.<a href="/assets/image_591830.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Old friends" src="/assets/image_591830.jpg" alt="Old friends." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Resorts World has its own sphere. It's not quite as impressive as The Sphere, but it's still pretty cool.<a href="/assets/image_567915.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="The mini-sphere at Resorts World" src="/assets/image_567915.jpg" alt="The mini-sphere at Resorts World." width="375" height="500" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>I initially thought it was projected, but sure enough it's also using some kind of LED technology.<a href="/assets/image_884399.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Checking out the pixels" src="/assets/image_884399.jpg" alt="Checking out the pixels." width="375" height="500" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Christer Janson was part of Autodesk's European Developer Support team back when I joined it in 1995. We don't see each other often, but when we do it's fantastic.<a href="/assets/image_134413.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Christer and Kean" src="/assets/image_134413.jpg" alt="Christer and Kean." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Monday's pre-event was the Technical Leadership Forum, a chance for various senior technical folks in the company to get together and improve collaboration between teams.<a href="/assets/image_663496.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="The Technical Leadership Forum" src="/assets/image_663496.jpg" alt="The Technical Leadership Forum." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a>I was randomly assigned to table 16, which also happened to have Christer and Manu (an old friend working on Tandem) sat there. </p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_870745.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Team 16" src="/assets/image_870745.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a>Among the day’s activities was a panel discussion between the company’s Chief Architects: </p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_102139.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Our divisional Chief Architects" src="/assets/image_102139.jpg" alt="Our divisional Chief Architects." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>The day was intense - especially with the jetlag - but good. From there we all made our way to join the other TechX attendees for the welcome reception.<a href="/assets/image_162365.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="TechX" src="/assets/image_162365.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>On the way I got to appreciate the sphere from the upstairs corridor.<a href="/assets/image_527227.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="The sphere from upstairs" src="/assets/image_527227.jpg" alt="The sphere from upstairs." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Here’s a video I made showing the Autodesk advertisement from two separate viewpoints:</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><object width="500" height="281"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/5H3hHVtOD1Q&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/5H3hHVtOD1Q&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="500" height="281" allowfullscreen="true" /></object></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The main TechX welcome reception was held on one of the lower rooftops.<a href="/assets/image_631440.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="The welcome reception" src="/assets/image_631440.jpg" alt="The welcome reception." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>It afforded another great view down The Strip:<a href="/assets/image_818772.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="The view up The Strip" src="/assets/image_818772.jpg" alt="The view up The Strip." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>There was plenty to eat, drink and play.<a href="/assets/image_25360.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Long table football" src="/assets/image_25360.jpg" alt="Long table football." width="375" height="500" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Along with some impressive acrobatics. (I was struggling to stay upright, at this point - because of fatigue, honestly - so walking on balls while juggling just didn’t compute.)<a href="/assets/image_530603.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Balancing act" src="/assets/image_530603.jpg" alt="Balancing act." width="375" height="500" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Tuesday kicked off with the opening keynote.<a href="/assets/image_768029.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Opening keynote" src="/assets/image_768029.jpg" alt="Opening keynote." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>I won’t talk about details of this - or any other - presentation from the week, because they're company-internal.<a href="/assets/image_769571.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Raji presenting" src="/assets/image_769571.jpg" alt="Raji presenting." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a>Our main host was Autodesk's CTO, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raji_Arasu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Raji Arasu</a>.<a href="/assets/image_338675.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="A full room" src="/assets/image_338675.jpg" alt="A full room." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>I was lucky to be presenting directly after the keynote, which meant that I could focus on other things straightaway afterwards.<a href="/assets/image_576909.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="My session" src="/assets/image_576909.jpg" alt="" width="375" height="500" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>The room looked very much like any other Las Vegas conference room I've presented in, over the years.<a href="/assets/image_708246.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="The room" src="/assets/image_708246.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Many thanks to Rhys Goldstein for sharing some snaps of me talking.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_534284.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="My talk at TechX 2024" src="/assets/image_534284.jpg" alt="My talk at TechX 2024." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_272840.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Lots of good questions" src="/assets/image_272840.jpg" alt="Lots of good questions." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>My Research colleagues, Tomas and Ray, were talking about our work on the project with The Bentway at the same time as I was - which really was the only downside of getting that early slot.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_222826.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Ray and Tomas" src="/assets/image_222826.jpg" alt="Ray and Tomas." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a>We also had the exhibit we took to AU 2023 - From Steps to Stories - on display for people to experience.<a href="/assets/image_407785.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="The booth opens" src="/assets/image_407785.jpg" alt="The booth opens." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>I was really pleased to see how well the exhibit resonated with our colleagues across the technical community at Autodesk.<a href="/assets/image_368493.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Lots of interest" src="/assets/image_368493.jpg" alt="Lots of interest." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Raji kindly stopped by as she did the rounds of the exhibit space.<a href="/assets/image_603744.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Raji stops by" src="/assets/image_603744.jpg" alt="Raji stops by." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>In the evening we had a divisional mixer. I didn’t end up taking photos of the event myself - but here’s one of me with another old friend from the 90s - Rudy Cazabon - from the official event photographer:</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_95027.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Kean and Rudy" src="/assets/image_95027.jpg" alt="Kean and Rudy." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Somehow, afterwards, we ended up in Chinatown to sing Karaoke in a private room. It was a lot of fun, but probably not the most sensible choice I made during the week given my already strained vocal cords.<a href="/assets/image_579953.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Karaoke" src="/assets/image_579953.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a>Thanks to Brian Jeong for sharing this photo. I also have a video, but no-one needs to see (or, more importantly, hear) that.<a href="/assets/image_847020.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Kean, Jonathon and Frederik" src="/assets/image_847020.jpg" alt="Kean, Jonathon and Frederik." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Wednesday kicked off with another keynote, this one focused on AI at Autodesk.<a href="/assets/image_26759.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Second day keynote" src="/assets/image_26759.jpg" alt="Second day keynote." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>During the afternoon our team ran a workshop focused on using Forma with Dynamo and VASA.<a href="/assets/image_679980.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="The workshop" src="/assets/image_679980.jpg" alt="The workshop." width="375" height="500" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Rhys Goldstein presented the theory...<a href="/assets/image_916409.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Rhys presenting" src="/assets/image_916409.jpg" alt="Rhys presenting." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>... while Liviu Calin stepped people through the practical parts of the workshop.<a href="/assets/image_471643.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="The workshop in progress" src="/assets/image_471643.jpg" alt="The workshop in progress." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>I was pleased with the attendance - we had representatives from Forma, Dynamo and ACS - as while this is currently a very niche topic I expect it to become increasingly relevant over time.<a href="/assets/image_616308.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Forma with Dynamo and VASA" src="/assets/image_616308.jpg" alt="Forma with Dynamo and VASA." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Wednesday evening had a mixer for the Research team:<a href="/assets/image_272060.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="The Research mixer" src="/assets/image_272060.jpg" alt="The Research mixer." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Followed by a trip next-door to one for the AEC team. (Thanks again, Rob!)</p>
<p>Here's a photo with Merry, Jacky and Liviu:<a href="/assets/image_692080.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Hanging out at the AEC mixer" src="/assets/image_692080.jpg" alt="Hanging out at the AEC mixer." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>It was another good chance to hang out with old friends from AutoCAD Engineering. Here's Montgomery, Christer, Jorge and Peter.<a href="/assets/image_549255.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Back with AutoCAD friends" src="/assets/image_549255.jpg" alt="Back with AutoCAD friends." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>My “brother”, Jonathon Breton, was also there. We compared notes on how a fun AI tool that created themed images of attendees somehow added hair to anyone without it.<a href="/assets/image_487007.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="My brother" src="/assets/image_487007.jpg" alt="" width="375" height="500" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>A shocking case of AI bias, frankly. When I had one of my own done, the person running it warned me that I'd probably get hair… I said this was just wrong: superheroes should be bald! He replied, after some thought, that he agreed: after all they’d fly better. (I like that guy a lot.)</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_80855.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Superhero Kean" src="/assets/image_80855.jpg" alt="Superhero Kean." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>There were other themes available: I also tried Cyberpunk 2077 - for which I don’t have a digital version - and this one with a royal theme, which I've placed next to our cocker spaniel puppy for context. They do say that owners look more and more like their dogs, over time...</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_797218.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="King Kean and Princess Daisy" src="/assets/image_797218.jpg" alt="King Kean and Princess Daisy." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Next stop after the AEC mixer was a private suite (I’m still not sure how and why), but it was all very sedate. Just a chance to hang out for a bit longer.<br /><a href="/assets/image_656731.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Heading up for a suite party" src="/assets/image_656731.jpg" alt="Heading up for a suite party." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>My last stop for the evening was <a href="http://tacoselgordobc.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tacos El Gordo</a>, just across The Strip.<a href="/assets/image_123431.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Across the street" src="/assets/image_123431.jpg" alt="Across the street." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>I wasn't hungry, at this point, but others very much enjoyed their tacos. Here's Jacky, Ray and Lorenzo.<a href="/assets/image_814554.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Tacos" src="/assets/image_814554.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Thursday was for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unconference</a> events that had been proposed during the first two days. My colleague Dagmara and I had proposed a topic about “human simulation”.<a href="/assets/image_715880.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Hosting an unconference" src="/assets/image_715880.jpg" alt="Hosting an unconference." width="375" height="500" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>It was a great format with a really good discussion. I hope this gets continued at future TechX events.<a href="/assets/image_64897.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Great discussion format" src="/assets/image_64897.jpg" alt="Great discussion format." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Wrapping up Thursday was the closing keynote, which was thankfully short and sweet.<a href="/assets/image_143310.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Closing keynote" src="/assets/image_143310.jpg" alt="Closing keynote." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>This was followed by the closing party at the <a href="https://www.rwlasvegas.com/entertainment/zouk-nightclub/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zouk</a> nightclub.<a href="/assets/image_798417.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="The closing party" src="/assets/image_798417.jpg" alt="The closing party." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>There were some really impressive visual - and even physical effects - and frankly I'm stunned by how many of my colleagues have proper moves. I managed to shoegaze for a bit but then sat down and relaxed by the side of the dancefloor: it had been a busy week, after all.<a href="/assets/image_528792.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> <img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="The dancefloor" src="/assets/image_528792.jpg" alt="The dancefloor." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a>Friday was for additional TechXtra events. Our Research team went along to the first two hours of the Forma Hackathon.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_479407.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Forma Hackathon" src="/assets/image_479407.jpg" alt="Forma Hackathon." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>It was a great opportunity to discuss plans to align our efforts with those of the Forma team.<a href="/assets/image_22414.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Various teams hacking extensions" src="/assets/image_22414.jpg" alt="Various teams hacking extensions." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>We then headed to <a href="https://www.rwlasvegas.com/dining/viva/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">¡Viva!</a> for a team meeting before folks headed on their separate ways to various parts of the world. It was a great way to wrap up a really busy but productive week.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_841980.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Our research team meeting" src="/assets/image_841980.jpg" alt="Our research team meeting." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Tomas and I took a quick selfie in front of the sphere before heading out.<a href="/assets/image_145442.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Kean and Tomas" src="/assets/image_145442.jpg" alt="Kean and Tomas." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>My taxi drove past The Sphere itself, so I took a snap of that out of the window, too.<a href="/assets/image_225286.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Heading to the airport" src="/assets/image_225286.jpg" alt="Heading to the airport." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>I had a direct flight to Zurich with Edelweiss. I thought I would sleep but ended up struggling to, so ended up doing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbenheimer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Barbenheimer</a>: amazingly I’d seen neither film prior to the flight. And yes, I started with Oppenheimer (that was the one I really wanted to see) and then moved on to Barbie once I realised sleep was elusive. Oppenheimer won hands-down, in my opinion.<a href="/assets/image_823965.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Home at last" src="/assets/image_823965.jpg" alt="Home at last." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a>So that was a round-up of my whirlwind week at TechX. A great chance to have fun with old friends but also to progress our Research agenda: it was really a valuable experience, as ever.</p>
<p><em><strong>Update</strong></em></p>
<p>It turns out that while I was watching Barbie, the most incredible show was going on outside. I’d tried (and failed) to upgrade to a window seat, so I had no idea this was happening until long after I landed. My friend and Research colleague, Andy Harris, did manage to capture this snap from his own flight back to the UK at the same time. Sigh.</p>
