<p>I received an email from Rick Webb - whom I've met a few times on trips to Amsterdam, and mentioned in <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2022/05/smarter-bridges-conference-2022.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this previous post</a> - telling me some news about the project. Rick was walking through the city on his usual route and came across the MX3D bridge being removed from its location in the heart of Amsterdam. It will presumably be replaced by a more traditional bridge at some point over the coming months.</p>
<p>I mentioned <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2023/07/visiting-the-mx3d-bridge-in-amsterdam-and-playing-football-in-munich.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">after my last visit</a> that this day was coming: the bridge was only ever intended to be in place for two years as a temporary art installation - and there was enough <a href="https://nltimes.nl/2023/02/05/3d-printed-bridge-red-light-district-will-soon-removed" target="_blank" rel="noopener">opposition from a local heritage preservation group</a> that this period was unlikely to be extended - but it’s still a poignant day for those who have been involved in the project over the years. It's a beautiful object - from my personal perspective - and the project has changed the way we think about the future of infrastructure.</p>
<p>I’m glad I was able to visit it when I could, over the last few years, and with two of my three kids.</p>
<p>Here are some photos that Rick took on Friday, in the rain, as the bridge was being prepared for its move. I believe it will be stored nearby until it’s next (or final?) destination is determined. I’ve put the photos in what I believe is chronological order, but as I wasn’t there I would take my comments in the tooltips with a pinch of salt.</p>
<p>The photos have all been taken after the “swirls” in the corners of the bridge have been unwelded and the bridge is being prepared to be hoisted by onto a barge - by a crane mounted on the same barge, as far as I can tell - to be taken away. Again, I’m reading between the lines somewhat, so happy to hear others’ opinions (or even knowledge!) about what’s happening.</p>

<p>Many thanks to Rick Webb for sending these photos across. I hope our paths will cross at some point when I’m back in Amsterdam.</p>
<p>I know many of you had the chance to see the bridge in the red light district. With any luck - for those of you who didn’t - it’s going to be somewhere which is also accessible to the public, as well as allowing the continuation of research related to its usage.</p>
