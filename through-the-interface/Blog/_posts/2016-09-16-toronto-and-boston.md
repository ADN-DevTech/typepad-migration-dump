<p>I arrived in Toronto on Sunday afternoon. Customs and immigration was extremely efficient – I just had to wait a while for my bag (one of these days I’ll manage to do an 8-day trip with just a carry-on, but not this time). Getting into downtown Toronto was a breeze, too, with the UPExpress from Pearson Airport to Union Station (I’m guessing UP stands for Union-Pearson). It even has free wi-fi – a blessing for international roamers such as myself.</p> <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b8d21db1fa970c-pi" target="_blank"><img title="Stunning Toronto" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 30px auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="Stunning Toronto" src="/assets/image_181221.jpg" width="500" height="281"></a></p> <p>Despite its size – and Toronto is *huge* – the downtown area is surprisingly walkable. I don’t have a step counter, but I must have walked about 20 km over the course of my stay. Which is great.</p> <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b7c893e77d970b-pi" target="_blank"><img title="Stagedoor at the TIFF" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 30px auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="Stagedoor at the TIFF" src="/assets/image_785225.jpg" width="500" height="281"></a></p> <p>I stayed at the Pantages Hotel, which was right nextdoor to the stage door of one of the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF) venues. Several times when I walked past there’d be autograph hunters waiting for stars to exit and climb into their blacked-out SUVs. I didn’t end up seeing any, myself, but that’s OK.</p> <p>It was really nice to be back in the Toronto office, although slightly surreal. We’ve been using a model of the office for the “Dasher 360” prototype I’m working on, and I feel I could navigate the 5th floor of the building with my eyes shut, at this stage. Interestingly the first-person navigation inside the Forge Viewer gives me the sense of being slightly smaller than in real life, though.</p> <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b7c893e784970b-pi" target="_blank"><img title="Generatively designed swingarm" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 30px auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="Generatively designed swingarm" src="/assets/image_7210.jpg" width="500" height="281"></a></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>I was happy to see the asymmetric, Dreamcatcher-designed motorcycle swingarm “in the flesh” (or whatever material it’s been printed in). I’ve presented this project several times, but hadn’t actually seen a physical version.</p> <p>Over the course of the next year or so, Autodesk Toronto is moving from 210 King Street East to an area of Toronto called <a href="https://www.marsdd.com" target="_blank">MaRS</a>. So yes, we’re moving to MaRS. We stopped by to check out the location of the new space – it’s going to be amazing.</p> <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b7c893e78c970b-pi" target="_blank"><img title="Moving to MaRS" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 30px auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="Moving to MaRS" src="/assets/image_132809.jpg" width="500" height="281"></a></p> <p>After a fruitful start to the week in Toronto, on Wednesday I headed back to Pearson to fly across to Boston. With hindsight I should have flown from the city airport – to avoid having to get to Pearson 3 hours in advance to clear US immigration before the flight – but I’ll know that for next time.</p> <p>The new Boston office is spectacular. It’s in South Boston, right by the harbour, and is a retrofit of a former shipbuilding facility. I swung by soon after arriving to attend the Mass Innovation Night being held at the new Build Space.</p> <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b7c893e790970b-pi" target="_blank"><img title="Autodesk's new Build Space" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 30px auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="Autodesk's new Build Space" src="/assets/image_600941.jpg" width="500" height="281"></a></p> <p>The office itself is the full 6th floor of the building. I find myself very disorientated here, though: there are too many axes of symmetry, so I never really know where I am, despite the supposedly helpful colour-coding.</p> <p>`<a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b7c893e79d970b-pi" target="_blank"><img title="The Autodesk Boston office" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 30px auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="The Autodesk Boston office" src="/assets/image_628804.jpg" width="500" height="281"></a></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Before leaving the office, I did swing by the Build Space again to say “Hello” to <a href="http://www.madlab.cc/" target="_blank">Madeline Gannon</a>, who’s working on a really interesting art exhibit with serious robotics. Madeline was an Artist in Residence on Pier 9 and has done some <a href="https://youtu.be/6RJBARrYDG8" target="_blank">really fun stuff</a>. We ended up putting her (physical) dancing robot next to my (virtual, inside HoloLens) version, which was pretty cool.</p> <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b8d21db212970c-pi" target="_blank"><img title="Madeline Gannon in the Build Space" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 30px auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="Madeline Gannon in the Build Space" src="/assets/image_308774.jpg" width="500" height="281"></a></p>
