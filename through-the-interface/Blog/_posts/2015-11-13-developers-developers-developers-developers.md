<p>There’s a lot of developer-oriented fun coming up over the coming weeks/months. <a href="http://autodeskdevdays.com/" target="_blank">The ADN team’s DevDays tour</a> kicks off <a href="http://autodeskdevdays.com/beijing-china" target="_blank">in Beijing</a> in a few days, with the largest single event taking place – as usual – the day before <a href="http://au.autodesk.com/las-vegas/overview" target="_blank">AU 2015</a> in <a href="http://autodeskdevdays.com/las-vegas/" target="_blank">Las Vegas</a>. I’ll be there for that, of course, but I’ve also booked my travel to be in Munich for <a href="http://autodeskdevdays.com/munich-3/" target="_blank">the main European DevDay + Accelerator</a> during the week of January 18-22, 2016. I’m very much looking forward to spending some more “quality time” with developers from across Europe – it should be a lot of fun (aside from I’m sure being very productive, too).</p>
<p>You should also expect some other, exciting, developer-related news over the coming weeks… I’ve been asked to help organise an event that’s happening in the middle of next year. I can’t go into specifics, just yet, but my involvement relates to <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/virtual-reality/" target="_blank">a particular passion of mine</a>, and the event itself will have a much broader focus than that. More on this soon…</p>

Carl Bass? Jeff Kowalski? Amar Hanspal? Maybe Jim Quanci? Post a comment!*</p>
