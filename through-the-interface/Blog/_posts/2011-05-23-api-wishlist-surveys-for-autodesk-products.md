<p>Our annual API wishlist surveys are now live:</p>  <p><font color="#118888"><a href="http://www.zoomerang.com/Survey/WEB22C9QA2TDYR" target="_blank">AutoCAD®</a></font>    <br /><a href="http://www.zoomerang.com/Survey/WEB22C9Q8JTD3G" target="_blank">AutoCAD® Civil 3D®</a>    <br /><a href="http://www.zoomerang.com/Survey/WEB22C9QACTE6V" target="_blank">Revit®</a>    <br /><a href="http://www.zoomerang.com/Survey/WEB22C9QBPTEZ5" target="_blank">Autodesk Inventor®</a>    <br /><a href="http://www.zoomerang.com/Survey/WEB22C9QBRTF2C" target="_blank">Autodesk Navisworks®</a></p>  <p>Please do take the time to provide us with your input: it’s one of the most direct ways to influence the direction of the Autodesk products you customize or for which you develop applications. Our various Engineering teams take this feedback very seriously when prioritising the APIs to expose over the coming releases of our software. And if you (optionally) provide your email address in the survey, I’ll send you a copy of the results once they’ve been compiled.</p>  <p>The surveys will remain open until <strong>June 3rd, 2011</strong>. Thanks in advance for your feedback!</p>
