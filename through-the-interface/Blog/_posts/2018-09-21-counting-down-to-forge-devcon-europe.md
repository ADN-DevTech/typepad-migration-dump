<p>We’re just a few weeks away from the 2nd European edition of the Forge DevCon. It’s being held in Darmstadt on October 16th, the day before this year’s AU Germany. This is a free, English-language* event where you can learn all about the capabilities that are currently (and will soon be) available through the Forge platform.</p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad36cc8ec200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="196" title="Autodesk Forge Devcon Europe" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Autodesk Forge Devcon Europe" src="/assets/image_901654.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>(* I’ve seen a number of emails asking whether the event will be in German or English, presumably due to its proximity with a German-language event. I can confirm that the <strong>entire program will be in English</strong>.)</p><p>Here are some “reasons to attend”, provided by the Forge team…</p><blockquote><ul><li><b><em>Get to Know Forge</em></b></li></ul><ul><ul><li><em>Take a deep dive into the Forge Viewer, BIM 360 API, Reality Capture, and industry specific solutions created with Forge APIs.<br>Plus preview just-released Forge updates to integrations, end-to-end workflow capabilities and much more.</em></li></ul></ul><ul><li><b><em>Disruptive Technologies</em></b></li></ul><ul><ul><li><em>AR, VR, machine learning and generative design can be brought to life using Forge. Learn how, and see how easy it is to get started.</em></li></ul></ul><ul><li><b><em>Web Programming</em></b></li></ul><ul><ul><li><em>Delve into topics from web application security to architecture to testing best practices, or brush up on the basics you need to transition from desktop to web programming.</em></li></ul></ul><ul><li><b><em>Forge Industry Stories</em></b></li></ul><ul><ul><li><em>Take in cross-category case studies showing how Autodesk partners and customers used Forge to solve real business problems, and what they learned along the way.</em></li></ul></ul><p><b><em></em></b><ul><li><b><em>Construction Technology with Forge + BIM 360</em></b></li></ul><ul><ul><li><em>Learn how Forge and BIM 360 have been used to create countless apps across the construction industry, helping teams innovate, digitize job sites, minimize data loss and increase efficiency.</em></li></ul></ul></blockquote><p>You can <a href="https://www.rayseven.com/r7/runtime/autodesk/devcon2018/registration.visitor.php?l=en&amp;x=ae2f251c260ae35625c82a0eedaf133d5b687331&amp;s=input" target="_blank">register today via this link</a>. I have registered, but still have some logistics to work out, given the fact it falls during my children’s school holidays. But I’m almost certainly going to be there.</p><p>In the meantime I have a few other trips coming up: next week I’ll spend the first part of the week in Rome, at the <a href="http://autodeskcloudaccelerator.com" target="_blank">Forge accelerator</a>, while the week after I’ll be splitting my time between Amsterdam and Barcelona. It’s a busy time of year!</p>
