<p>Upload a <a href="http://www.google.com/support/youtube/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=57931">video response</a> to this video, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahvr_IHcKcs">Reasons to Attend Autodesk University</a>, and you could win one of three conference passes (each valued at $2,395*):</p>  <p><object width="425" height="344"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/ahvr_IHcKcs&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/ahvr_IHcKcs&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="344"></embed></object></p>  <p>The sooner you upload it, the better, as the competition is driven by the number of views the video receives (and then, in the second round, by the number of “likes” on Facebook… all very 21st century… :-). For more information on the content, <a href="http://au.autodesk.com/?nd=youtube_contest&amp;und=282">visit this page</a>.</p>  <p>Oh, and as a side benefit, winners will be able to attend <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2009/05/last-day-of-voting-for-au-2009-classes.html">classes delivered by me and members of my team</a>. :-)</p>  <p><em>* The early bird discount takes the price of this type of pass to $1,895 if you register by October 9th.</em></p>
