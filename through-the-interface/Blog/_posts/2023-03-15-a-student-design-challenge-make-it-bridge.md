<p>Over on <a href="https://www.instructables.com/" target="_blank">Instructables</a> there’s a student design challenge featuring the <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2022/11/building-the-5m-dar-smart-bridge.html" target="_blank">5m Dar Smart Bridge</a>.</p><p>It’s called “<a href="https://www.instructables.com/contest/makeitbridge2023/" target="_blank">Make It Bridge</a>”, and the idea is that contestants – who have to be students aged between 13 and 21 and based in the USA or Canada (excluding Quebec, for some reason) – can place the geometry of the Dar bridge, or another bridge of their choosing, in surroundings to which it adds value. It sounds like a lot of fun.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202b7519aab04200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="188" title="Make it Bridge" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Make it Bridge" src="/assets/image_542070.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>I like the guidance given:</p><blockquote><p>In choosing the site for the bridge, you might consider what it would look like from below and from a distance, how it would feel to cross it, and what it could offer to the spaces or even nature beneath it. You might also consider how it could be <strong><em>embedded with technology like sensors</em></strong> that could collect data which might be used to gain new insights and understanding. </p></blockquote><p>The good news for those of us who are ineligible – whether due to age, location or employment status – is that we can use the challenge to download the geometry of this very cool bridge.</p><p>You can basically get it either by opening the <a href="https://www.tinkercad.com/things/eVPZ6y5mWcr" target="_blank">Tinkercad model</a> and then clicking on the Fusion 360 model link or by clicking <a href="https://myhub.autodesk360.com/ue28e31fa/g/shares/SH35dfcQT936092f0e43379970356c6695ee" target="_blank">this link</a> directly. ;-)</p><p align="center"><br></p><p align="center"><iframe width="500" height="312" src="https://www.tinkercad.com/embed/eVPZ6y5mWcr?editbtn=1" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p><p><br></p><p>When the Fusion Team viewer has loaded you can use it to download the bridge model in the 3D format of your choice.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202b7519aab0b200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="306" title="Download in the format of your choice" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Download in the format of your choice" src="/assets/image_575517.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Here it is loaded inside AutoCAD, for instance:</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202b6852d8912200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="530" height="325" title="Dar bridge in AutoCAD" style="margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; float: none; display: block;" alt="Dar bridge in AutoCAD" src="/assets/image_614614.jpg"></a>Please do go ahead and spread the word about this interesting opportunity to eligible participants – it could be worth a scholarship of $10,000 to them!</p>
