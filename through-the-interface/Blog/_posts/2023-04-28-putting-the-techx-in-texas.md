<p>I’m packing my bags soon for another trip across the pond for our annual, Autodesk-internal geekfest, TechX 2023.</p><p>This year’s event is being held in Dallas, Texas, a city I haven’t visited in perhaps 20 years. I’m sure a lot has changed – we’ll see!</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202b751a33494200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="308" title="Dallas, Texas" style="margin: 30px auto 10px; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Dallas, Texas" src="/assets/image_608048.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p align="center"><font color="#a5a5a5" size="2">Photo credit: </font><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/roberthensley/" target="_blank"><font color="#a5a5a5" size="2">Robert Hensley</font></a><font color="#a5a5a5" size="2">, </font><a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/deed.en" target="_blank"><font color="#a5a5a5" size="2">CC license</font></a><font color="#a5a5a5" size="2">.</font></p><p>In any case TechX isn’t about the venue – or even about the technical content, which, while often really interesting, is also watchable remotely during and after the event – as much as the chance to (re)connect with people. In that sense it’s similar to the Autodesk University experience, which is really about in-person connection for those lucky enough to be there physically.</p><p>With many people at Autodesk working remotely, these days – even though the pandemic is over, as a company <a href="https://adsknews.autodesk.com/en/news/flex-forward-hybrid-work/" target="_blank">we’re doubling down on flexible (hybrid) working</a> – these events are even more important. I, for one, am very much looking forward to it.</p><p>During the event I’ll be presenting alongside my colleague, Dagmara Szkurlat, about our <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2022/09/human-centric-building-design.html" target="_blank">current research focus</a>. Given the looming deadline for AU class proposals, I’ll also be spending some time crafting a few of those, too. I’ll share more from Dallas!</p>
