<p>A reminder that <a href="http://au.autodesk.com/speaker-resource-center/call-for-proposals" target="_blank">proposals are open</a> for <a href="http://au.autodesk.com" target="_blank">AU2015</a> until <strong>May 26th</strong>. I’ve just submitted two, myself. Of the <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2015/04/au2015-call-for-proposals-opens-next-week.html" target="_blank">three topics I had in mind</a> – relating to VR, AutoCAD I/O and TypeScript – I decided to submit proposals on the first two: I’ll do my best to use TypeScript for one or both of the other two (assuming they get accepted) which will at least give people some exposure to how the technology works. And give some good fodder for blog posts, of course.</p>
<p>Here are the abstracts I submitted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Virtual Reality viewing of 3D models using Autodesk&#39;s View and Data API</strong></em></p>
<p><em>2015 is the year in which Virtual Reality is finally ready for the masses: Google Cardboard was perfect for democratizing VR, while products like Samsung Gear VR have helped increase the quality for scenarios that require it. Importantly, both technologies are powered by mobile phones.</em></p>
<p><em>This session looks at the steps to create web-based VR for design visualization using Autodesk’s View and Data API, and how this core implementation can be extended via native Android SDKs for both Google Cardboard and Samsung Gear VR.</em></p>
<p><em>We will also spend time looking at Augmented Reality technologies such as Magic Leap and Microsoft HoloLens to understand the implications for design and engineering.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This first class is largely already written – I presented an early draft a few weeks ago in Singapore – apart from the piece in the last paragraph related to AR. Hopefully I’ll be able to demo something related to HoloLens in December, but it’s a bit too soon to say, at this stage.</p>
<p>The second class is going to take some more work, but I’m pretty sure it’ll come together nicely.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Integrating .NET code with AutoCAD I/O to add design intelligence to your web-site</strong></em></p>
<p><em>Over the last decade or so, software developers have amassed a significant amount of intellectual property harnessing AutoCAD&#39;s .NET API. AutoCAD I/O allows standard AutoCAD commands as well as those implemented in .NET to be executed in the cloud, generating results that can be integrated into your own B2B or B2C web-site.</em></p>
<p><em>This class takes a concrete example of a .NET application creating custom jigsaw puzzles inside AutoCAD. During the class we show how to move the core implementation to AutoCAD I/O via the Core Console, and then make use of this to power a new B2C web-site. Potential customers will be able to specify custom designs for jigsaw puzzles and visualize the results before finalizing their orders.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s what I’m hoping to present at this year’s AU. If you’re interested in submitting your own class but would like some free* advice, feel free to drop me <a href="mailto:kean.walmsley@autodesk.com" target="_blank">a quick email</a>. I’d be happy to review your proposal and provide feedback. Although please do so soon, as I’m travelling to the US for the 10 days prior to the deadline and may not have much time during that period to read and respond to email.</p>
<p><em>(* An optional fee may get applied: the going rate is one beer somewhere in the vicinity of The Venetian per proposal reviewed. This fee is only applicable for proposals that get accepted, of course. ;-)</em></p>
