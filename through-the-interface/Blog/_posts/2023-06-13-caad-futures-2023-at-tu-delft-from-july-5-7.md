<p>For the last few years I’ve been on the <a href="https://www.caadfutures2023.nl/wiki/737681/about" target="_blank">scientific committee</a> for a conference called <a href="https://www.caadfutures2023.nl/" target="_blank">CAAD Futures</a>. My involvement began with the 2021 edition of the conference: I reviewed several papers submitted to the conference and also ended up being invited to talk during one of the conference’s workshops (it was called <em>Beyond generative Computer Aided-Architectural/Urban Design (CAAD/CAUD)</em> and was hosted by Todor Stojanovski). That last edition was held in Los Angeles – and the workshop hosted in Stockholm – but I only participated remotely.</p><p>This year’s edition is being held in Europe, at TU Delft in the Netherlands, from July 5th-7th, and it’s time to go there in-person, which will be a welcome change. :-)</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202b751a7dd96200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="382" title="CAAD Futures 2023" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="CAAD Futures 2023" src="/assets/image_276694.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>I’ve been asked to given a presentation about <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2022/09/human-centric-building-design.html" target="_blank">human-centric building design</a> during the evening of July 5th and then participate in a panel discussion.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202c1a6ca6b2e200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="700" title="Invited talks on July 7" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Invited talks on July 7" src="/assets/image_294845.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>I’m also planning on attending one of the <a href="https://www.caadfutures2023.nl/wiki/737707/co-creation" target="_blank">Co-creation sessions</a> on July 6th – there are some really interesting topics! I hope to see some of you there – I think it will be a valuable few days.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>

<p>I wasn’t sure I’d be able to participate in this event, at first, as on July 7th I’m due to head to Munich for this year’s Autodesk Football Tournament – I’ve been invited to play with the Tandemists team, which should be a lot of fun – and I’ll be travelling there with my daughter. In the end we decided to do the whole trip together, so she’ll be coming with me to Delft, too. On our way from Delft to Munich on the Friday, we’re planning on dropping by the centre of Amsterdam to walk across the MX3D bridge together. When in Rome and all that.</p>
