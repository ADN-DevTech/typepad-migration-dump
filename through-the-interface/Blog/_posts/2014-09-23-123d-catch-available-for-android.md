<p>I was very happy to read <a href="http://autodesk.blogs.com/between_the_lines/2014/09/create-3d-models-from-photos-using-your-android-device.html" target="_blank">the news on Shaan’s blog</a>: 123D Catch is now available on Android. I blogged about <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2012/05/new-versions-of-123d-catch-for-web-and-ipad.html" target="_blank">its availability via the web and on iOS</a>, a couple of years ago, but <a href="http://blog.123dapp.com/2014/09/123d-catch-now-on-android" target="_blank">there’s now an Android version</a> and it’s pretty slick.<a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b8d06fa1ea970c-pi" target="_blank"><img title="123D Catch on Google Play" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 20px auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="123D Catch on Google Play" src="/assets/image_820152.jpg" width="470" height="414" /></a></p>  <p>Some quick background info: I do my best to stay OS agnostic, as a rule. My primary desktop OS is Windows (7 or 8.1, depending) but I also use OS X Mavericks and play with a few different Linux distributions when I get time. I have an old iPad 2 that has a cracked – but still functional – screen and use a Nexus 4 phone currently running Android 4.4.4 (as you can see, I tend not to follow the expected 2-year mobile refresh cycle, if I can avoid it… there are too many other fun gadgets to spend money on :-).</p>  <p>While living like this (embracing <a href="http://windowsitpro.com/mobile/thinking-about-tech-pluralism" target="_blank">tech pluralism</a>) causes some degree of pain – things don’t “just work” a lot of the time – it feels good to surf the waves caused by the ebb and flow of the tech industry. And, anyway, I hate the view from walled gardens – I want to see the horizon! ;-)</p>  <p>So yes, the main device I walk around with, these days, runs Android and has been waiting patiently for <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.autodesk.Catch" target="_blank">123D Catch to show up on Google Play</a>.</p>  <p>I started by creating a project and using the app to take snaps of a stone tea-light holder I received for my 30th birthday (I think it was, anyway).<a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201bb078ac43d970d-pi" target="_blank"><img title="Photographing the stone" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 20px auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="Photographing the stone" src="/assets/image_540233.jpg" width="394" height="238" /></a></p>  <p>Then I went ahead and uploaded the project for processing:</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b8d06fa288970c-pi"><img title="Transmitting and processing photos" style="float: none; margin: 20px auto; display: block" alt="Transmitting and processing photos" src="/assets/image_635013.jpg" width="250" height="417" /></a></p>  <p>Once completed, I followed the prompts to review the 3D model and then frame it for publication.</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b7c6e5ae9d970b-pi"><img title="Reviewing, framing and publishing" style="float: none; margin: 20px auto; display: block" alt="Reviewing, framing and publishing" src="/assets/image_626447.jpg" width="250" height="417" /></a></p>  <p><a href="http://www.123dapp.com/Catch/Stone-candle/2775172" target="_blank">The results</a> were decent, although I did miss a bit of photo coverage on the back of the candle, leading to a couple of small holes. Nothing that couldn’t be fixed using <a href="http://www.meshmixer.com" target="_blank">meshmixer</a>, <a href="https://beta.autodesk.com/callout/?callid=D69655022B4F42C880513D4E3085C7D0" target="_blank">Project Memento</a> or the 123D cleanup tool, though. </p>  <br /><iframe id="embed3DViewer" style="border-top-style: none; height: 470px; width: 470px; border-bottom-style: none; border-right-style: none; border-left-style: none" src="http://www.123dapp.com/fullpreview/embedViewer?assetId=2775172&amp;size=medium" scrolling="no"> </iframe>  <p>If you have an Android device, take the new app for a spin and see what you think!</p>
