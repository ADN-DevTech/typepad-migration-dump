<p>On Sunday night I headed to Geneva airport to take a late flight to Copenhagen for a special Sustainability-focused APS Accelerator.</p><p>I knew something was up with my flight when at 7:49pm the gate information that was promised to be shown at 7:25pm still wasn’t posted. (This is Switzerland. Something was badly wrong with this scenario.)</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202b6852f0668200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="376" height="500" title="Uh oh" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Uh oh" src="/assets/image_771267.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>It turns out the inbound flight from Nice was delayed by an hour, which meant our flight to Copenhagen would arrive at midnight rather than 11pm.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202b7519c0598200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="The plane" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="The plane" src="/assets/image_909334.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Walking through Copenhagen’s beautiful airport at that time of night was highly surreal. It was completely deserted.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202b7519c2df9200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Empty airport" style="margin: 30px auto;

I talk regularly with Marta, but it’s rare that we get to see each other in person (even though we’re both Swiss-based).</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202b6852f0658200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Marta talking carbon" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Marta talking carbon" src="/assets/image_50931.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>One nice surprise from the first day of the accelerator was bumping into David Fink from Henning Larsen. He invited me to visit their office in downtown Copenhagen the following morning to meet with their computational design team.</p><p>Henning Larsen is part of the Ramboll group: from what I understand they’re the group’s architecture arm, although they have an “open” relationship (they do work for other clients and Ramboll similarly uses other architectural firms). Their office is very different from the Ramboll HQ – for one thing it’s much more central, and you wouldn’t find it unless you knew to look for it.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202b75177b76c200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="499" height="375" title="Henning Larsen" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Henning Larsen" src="/assets/image_256865.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>It’s a lovely office, but as usual when visiting architectural customers I didn’t take pictures, as I never know what’s confidential from all the cool stuff on display.</p><p>I did take some photos from their roof terrace, though, as it was one of the rare moments during the week that the sun was out.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202b75177b70d200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Kean and David" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Kean and David" src="/assets/image_905422.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Here’s a quick panorama.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202b7519c0612200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="105" title="View from the roof" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="View from the roof" src="/assets/image_340615.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Inevitably during the week there were dinners. We had to eat, after all.</p><p>While I did miss Sunday’s, we had a very nice sushi dinner on Monday.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202b75177b6c5200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Sushi" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Sushi" src="/assets/image_460974.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>The main celebration was on Tuesday night. It was a very nice evening.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202b6852ee917200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="333" title="Our table at dinner" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Our table at dinner" src="/assets/image_738735.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202b7519c103f200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="333" title="Adam and others" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Adam and others" src="/assets/image_999261.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202b6852ee93e200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="333" title="Michael and Philippe" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Michael and Philippe" src="/assets/image_827196.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202b6852ee942200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="333" title="Philippe and Kean" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Philippe and Kean" src="/assets/image_409909.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>We went for a couple more drinks afterwards, too.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202b6852ee001200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Some fun after" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Some fun after" src="/assets/image_198816.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>On my last night we went to a quirky Danish-Italian restaurant.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202b7519c2dde200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Dinner at Il Buco" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Dinner at Il Buco" src="/assets/image_784071.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>It was a lovely few days.
