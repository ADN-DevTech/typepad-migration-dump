<p>The world’s biggest WebVR hackathon – <a href="http://virtuleap.com" target="_blank">Virtuleap</a> – kicked off on Thursday of last week. Before we talk about the hackathon, let’s discuss why it’s an exciting time for this technology…</p> <p><a href="https://webvr.info/" target="_blank">WebVR</a> is exploding on a number of fronts, most of which relate to the industry as a whole, while one is a little more Autodesk-centric.</p> <ol> <li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/06/oculus-webvr/" target="_blank">Oculus recently announced support for WebVR – and a new ReactVR framework – in their Carmel browser</a></li> <ul> <li>It was announced a whole month ago – which seems like ages, these days – but this is a significant milestone</li></ul> <li><a href="http://www.roadtovr.com/google-launching-webvr-support-for-android-chrome-in-january-desktop-to-follow" target="_blank">Google is launching WebVR support for Android Chrome in January</a>  <ul> <li>This is a big deal: a large number of smartphones will soon have WebVR support by default</li></ul> <li>WebVR is progressing steadily towards being a ratified W3C standard  <ul> <li>There’s lots of great content online from the recent <a href="https://www.w3.org/2016/06/vr-workshop/schedule.html" target="_blank">W3C Workshop on Web &amp; Virtual Reality</a>, which gives a great feel for this progress (many thanks to Giorgio Mazzucchelli for thinking to share this link)</li></ul> <li>The version of the Forge Viewer currently in staging (v2.12) is the first to support WebVR properly  <ul> <li>If you load the WebVR extension in your code, you’ll get a VR button show up when a WebVR-compatible HMD (e.g. HTC Vive, Oculus Rift) is connected, or the page is loaded on a Google Cardboard-/Daydream VR-capable smartphone  <li>There’s still some work needed to get the viewer to support “widget viewing” – à la <a href="http://vrok.it" target="_blank">Vrok It</a> – but it’s a solid start</li></ul></li></ol> <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201bb0950228d970d-pi" target="_blank"><img title="WebVR in the Forge Viewer" style="float: none; margin: 30px auto; display: block" alt="WebVR in the Forge Viewer" src="/assets/image_222287.jpg" width="500" height="281"></a></p> <p>Anyway, on to the hackathon. This is an interesting event with some serious incentives for participating.</p> <ul> <li>The top prize is € 30K with a spot in a 6-month Amsterdam-based VR accelerator  <li>As a 90-day hackathon the submission deadline – February 1st – is still a ways off, so you have time to put together something really interesting  <li>It’s a completely online event, so you can collaborate with like-minded individuals around the world</li></ul> <p>I see a few familiar faces on the <a href="http://www.virtuleap.com/page/view/competition" target="_blank">list of judges</a>, so I have no doubt the event will be managed professionally and lead to some really interesting projects being born.</p> <p>So… if you’re interested in building a team that uses the Forge Viewer to create a submission for this hackathon, please submit a comment to this post: if you’re looking for teammates then I can certainly help you get connected. I’d also be very happy to informally advise teams that choose to go down this path (who knows – I may even want to join one, if the idea’s compelling enough :-).</p> <p>Happy hacking!</p>
