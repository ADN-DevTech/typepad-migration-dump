<p><a href="http://www.autodeskresearch.com" target="_blank">Autodesk Research</a> has launched a new app via <a href="http://labs.autodesk.com" target="_blank">Autodesk Labs</a> called <a href="https://beta.autodesk.com/callout/?callid={51340063-7485-4635-BCE6-AF45AE7CD11D}" target="_blank">Project Draco</a>. Here’s a description of this innovative tool:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Draco is an iPad app from Autodesk Research that makes animation as easy as sketching, without the complications of timelines, scripting, and key-framing. The interface of Draco leverages users’ intuitive sense of space and time. Compared to traditional 2D animation tools, it provides a simple interface allowing users to add a rich set of subtle, continuous animation effects quickly and without technical knowledge.</p>    <p>By enabling the creation of dynamic (animated &amp; interactive) media with sketch-based interfaces, our goal is to empower a wide range of users with powerful ways of thinking and communication.</p>    <p>Bring life to your design sketches, drawings, technical diagrams, eBooks, teaching materials, greeting cards, and much more!</p> </blockquote>  <p>Here’s a quick video showing some of the results you can get using Draco:</p>  <p align="center">&#160;</p>  <p align="center"><iframe height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sIcuYRSU8A0?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" width="560" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>When I first heard about Draco, I assumed it was primarily intended to be used by artists. But then I saw some example images showing how it might be used to animate mechanical illustrations…</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b7c7f7fde7970b-pi" target="_blank"><img title="An animated engine" style="float: none; margin: 50px auto; display: block" alt="An animated engine" src="/assets/image_588734.jpg" width="420" height="315" /></a></p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b8d181a546970c-pi" target="_blank"><img title="Ring that bell" style="float: none; margin: 0px auto 50px; display: block" alt="Ring that bell" src="/assets/image_194981.jpg" width="420" height="315" /></a></p>  <p>As well as architectural…</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b8d181a54b970c-pi" target="_blank"><img title="Highlighting important aspects of an architectural model" style="float: none; margin: 50px auto; display: block" alt="Highlighting important aspects of an architectural model" src="/assets/image_843536.jpg" width="420" height="315" /></a></p>  <p>And, of cause, the more whimsical…</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201bb089c369d970d-pi" target="_blank"><img title="Bubbles" style="float: none; margin: 50px auto; display: block" alt="Bubbles" src="/assets/image_931791.jpg" width="420" height="315" /></a></p>  <p>Although even whimsical images can convey important messages, of course…</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b8d181a553970c-pi" target="_blank"><img title="Merry Christmas" style="float: none; margin: 50px auto; display: block" alt="Merry Christmas" src="/assets/image_769233.jpg" width="420" height="315" /></a></p>  <p>Looking at <a href="https://beta.autodesk.com/callout/?callid={51340063-7485-4635-BCE6-AF45AE7CD11D}" target="_blank">the Labs site</a>, it seems the Draco iPad app is being deployed via <a href="https://developer.apple.com/testflight/" target="_blank">TestFlight</a>, Apple’s testing platform. If I’ve understood the web-site correctly, the platform limits projects 2,000 users, so I suggest signing up promptly if you’re interested in participating. Thanks in advance for your feedback!</p>
