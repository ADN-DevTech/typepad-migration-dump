<p>On Friday I did my annual (well, it’s actually only the second time, but I get the feeling it’s becoming annual) trip to Winterthur for the Friday-night kick-off of this year’s AEC Hackathon Zürich.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_696670.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="The flyer" src="/assets/image_696670.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>The focus of the first set of Friday afternoon talks was on the wood industry and its challenges - a fascinating topic to hear about first-hand.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_724471.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Wood" src="/assets/image_724471.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>I was actually more interested by the second set of talks, which were focused on digitalization challenges, including a really nice session by Michael Drobnik from Herzog &amp; de Meuron.</p>

<p>As last year there were lots of hackers present, and the organization was typically “Swiss” (i.e. everything worked).</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_450009.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Lots of people" src="/assets/image_450009.jpg" alt="Lots of people." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>It was once again at the ZHAW building near the railway station in Winterthur. This time I spotted a handmade model of the Watchmaking Museum in la Chaux-de-Fonds (near where we live).</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_353745.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Watchmaking museum model" src="/assets/image_353745.jpg" alt="Watchmaking museum model." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Someone was showing off some construction exo-skeleton research that had come out of ETH Zürich. Looked cool!</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_731977.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Exo-skeleton research" src="/assets/image_731977.jpg" alt="Exo-skeleton research." width="375" height="500" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>I was mainly there to say Hi to some old friends, particularly Damon Hernandez...</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_33388.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Damon and Kean" src="/assets/image_33388.jpg" alt="Damon and Kean." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a>… and Alex Walzer, who recently became “Dr. Alex” (congratulations, once again!).</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_872826.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Alex and Kean" src="/assets/image_872826.jpg" alt="Alex and Kean." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>The announcement of challenges and the formation of teams happened soon before I headed off - my February weekends are 100% allocated to being on the slopes, something I really don’t want to compromise even for an event like this.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_936708.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Max introducing the Hackathon proper" src="/assets/image_936708.jpg" alt="Max introducing the Hackathon proper." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>I did stay to see Damon giving his introduction before I “sloped” off. Haha.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_434342.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Damon doing his thing" src="/assets/image_434342.jpg" alt="Damon doing his thing." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>I was happy that I did head up, though, as I had a lot of fun snowboarding with my daughter.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_229874.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Father-daughter boarding" src="/assets/image_229874.jpg" alt="Father-daughter boarding." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>And there's always another Hackathon to join. The next one in my calendar has just been announced: a Dynamo Hackathon will be held ahead of the Autodesk DevCon in Amsterdam on May 19th. Mark your calendars and be sure to arrive a day early for the conference!<a href="/assets/image_325550.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Dynamo Hackathon" src="/assets/image_325550.jpg" alt="Dynamo Hackathon." width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a>I’m now confirmed as a speaker for the conference proper, and have been cooking up some really neat (if I do say so myself) demos showing multi-agent simulation in Forma (and later Tandem). It’ll be a lot of fun!</p>
