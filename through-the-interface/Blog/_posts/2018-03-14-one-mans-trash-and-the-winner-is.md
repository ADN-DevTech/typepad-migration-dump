<p>Many thanks to all of you who responded to <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2018/03/one-mans-trash-a-copy-of-the-autodesk-file-signed-by-john-walker.html" target="_blank">the last “one man’s trash” post</a> offering a signed copy of The Autodesk File for one of the people answering John’s question correctly:</p><blockquote><p><strong>What was the first Autodesk product which, after having been sold, was subsequently discontinued?</strong></p></blockquote><p>The answer is, of course, <strong>AutoScreen</strong>. Of the 15 people who responded, 7 gave the correct answer (the other popular – albeit incorrect – answers were MicroCAD and Lightscape).</p><p>John’s “bonus points” question really had people scratching their heads:</p><blockquote><p><strong>What was the original in-house name for the product eventually introduced as AutoSketch?</strong></p></blockquote><p>(In all fairness, John estimated there were probably only 20 people on the planet who knew the answer to this question…)</p><p>The answer to this one is <strong>Masterstroke</strong>, which really seems like the perfect codename for it.</p><p>Nobody got this one right, so I performed a completely random selection which resulted in Brian Johnson’s name being picked. Congratulations, Brian!</p><p>As a reminder, this is the copy Brian will be receiving, once I’ve managed to get it signed by John. It’s a 3rd edition and was published by a proper publishing house.</p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201bb09fb7023970d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="375" height="500" title="The Autodesk File in physical form" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="The Autodesk File in physical form" src="/assets/image_283054.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>During <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2018/03/celebrating-a-20-year-journey.html" target="_blank">my evening discussion with John Goodman</a>, he mentioned he also had a copy of the book that he didn’t want. This one’s a 2nd edition, and seems as though it was bound less professionally.</p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b8d2e275ae970c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="A second edition of The Autodesk File" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="A second edition of The Autodesk File" src="/assets/image_119810.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>I’m sorry to say that I’m going to keep this one for myself, though: judging from the inside cover it once belonged to an old friend and former Autodesker, Abel Smit, so I think it’s only fair that I hang on to it in case he wants it back, one day. ;-)</p><p><strong><em>Update:</em></strong></p><p>Here’s a snap of Brian with his signed copy of The Autodesk File:</p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20224df372039200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Brian Johnson with The Autodesk File" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Brian Johnson with The Autodesk File" src="/assets/image_936591.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Congratulations once again, Brian, and thanks for sending this across! Nice touch including the R13 box, too. :-)</p>
