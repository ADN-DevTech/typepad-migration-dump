<p>This is both my 500th post on Through the Interface and my 500th tweet as <a href="http://twitter.com/keanw">@keanw</a>. All my blog posts now go out via Twitter, but this hasn’t always been the case, so this is partly coincidence and partly planned (since I noticed a few weeks ago that I was getting close to this number for both blogging and micro-blogging sites).</p>  <p>Thanks to all of you regular readers for your support, your feedback and the questions that have inspired me to write many of these 500 posts. Keep them coming! :-)</p>  <p>And many thanks to my team, DevTech, for contributing such good material to post (whether deliberately or inadvertently).</p>  <p>A quick note on my two-week trip around Asia… I’ve just arrived safely in Tokyo, albeit without my luggage. Hopefully it’ll catch up with me before I head on to Beijing on Wednesday.</p>
