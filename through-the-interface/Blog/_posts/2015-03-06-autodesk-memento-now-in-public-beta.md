<p>One of the announcements at the recent <a href="http://real2015.com" target="_blank">REAL 2015</a> conference – and if you missed the event, as I did, you can see <a href="http://3dprintingindustry.com/2015/03/03/top-10-takeaways-real-2015/" target="_blank">a great summary here</a> – was the fact that the much-appreciated mesh manipulation tool from our Reality Solutions division, Autodesk Memento, has now entered public beta. It has graduated from Autodesk Labs and <a href="http://memento.autodesk.com/try-memento" target="_blank">is now available for download</a> without you having to log into the beta portal. It also has <a href="http://memento.autodesk.com" target="_blank">a brand new web-site</a> describing why you might want to use it.</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b8d0e417e7970c-pi"><img title="Memento" style="display: inline" alt="Memento" src="/assets/image_706314.jpg" width="470" height="286" /></a></p>  <p>For those of you who have been tracking its progress, release on release, here are the main features in the posted v1.0.14.2:</p>  <ul>   <li>FBX with cameras export </li>    <li>Camera location preview in canvas (note that you will need to reprocess your scenes in order to see the cameras) </li>    <li>Bridge tool exposed under the Edit menu </li>    <li>New ground plane that helps with orienting the model in space </li>    <li>Separated orient model and coordinate system</li>    <li>Improved dashboard </li>    <li>RCM package file format that now contains the texture as well, so your mesh is all in one native Memento file </li>    <li>Memento now checks for low disk space situations, notifying the user when they don’t have enough space to save </li>    <li>Zooming into empty space now stops at certain distance away from the object. Zooming out Or ‘Fit-to-view’ will bring the model back into view </li>    <li>Improvement in 'waiting in queue' time for ReCap processing</li> </ul>  <p>Here’s a video overview of the product’s features:</p>  <br /><iframe height="264" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iPxZkSswVs0?rel=0&amp;controls=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" width="470" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>  <br />  <br />  <p>If you’re interested in using Memento, I recommend watching this recorded webinar that talks about how best to take photos which, when processed, will result in a well-formed mesh:</p>  <br /><iframe height="264" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WLXqNXOWLLo?rel=0&amp;controls=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" width="470" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>  <br />  <br />  <p>Over the coming weeks an online gallery will be available from the product, too, showcasing some of the amazing projects people have used Memento to create.</p>
