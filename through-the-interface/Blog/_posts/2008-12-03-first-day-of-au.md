<p>It was a busy first day of AU 2008, for me, at least: after internal meetings - and the AU keynote - in the morning, I participated in the "AutoCAD APIs - Meet the Experts" panel session this afternoon, and then attended a number of events in the evening, one of which was the AU Blogger Social, where I spent some time chatting with Jose from <a href="http://www.cadkicks.com/">Cadkicks.com</a>:</p> <p><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/GxEW_B3PDSU&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1" width="425" height="344" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always"></p> <p>Tomorrow I deliver the first of my three classes at this year's AU, <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2007/10/au-handouts-the.html">"There's more to .DWG than AutoCAD®"</a>.</p></embed>
