<p>Now that I’m back from <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2025/06/toronto.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Toronto</a> I have the time to share some news that came our way last week.</p>
<p>The production team at <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/sustainable-cities" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Frontiers in Sustainable Cities</a> informed us that a paper we’ve been working on - <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frsc.2025.1530431" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Experiential space analysis: scoring tranquil, social, and explorative places in habitable buildings</a> - has been published in their research topic on <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/research-topics/65121/intelligent-systems-for-sustainable-building-balancing-ieq-with-energy-efficiency/articles" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Intelligent Systems for Sustainable Building: Balancing IEQ with Energy Efficiency</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frsc.2025.1530431" rel="noopener" target="_blank">paper</a> is the culmination of significant effort from the various authors - Rhys, Nastaran, Jeremy, Seba, Dianne, Frederik, Mike, Liviu, Tomas, Dagmara and myself - over a couple of years. The paper charts the start of our journey to explore whether spatial analysis allows us to predict how architectural spaces might be used - whether they are tranquil, social or explorative in nature - in order to deliver insights early in the design phase when various decisions around materials etc. have not been made.</p>
<p>Technically the various prototypes we created to support this work made heavy use of voxel-based space analysis - we used our VASA library for this, of course - whether from Dynamo (our primary development environment) or inside Forma. Here’s a prototype Forma extension that makes use of VASA’s WebAssembly module to deliver insights based on the algorithms outlined in the paper:</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">You should think of this paper as the beginning of a discussion on this topic: we’ve deliberately chosen language indicating that we’re trying to <em>predict</em> these qualities - rather than saying we’re <em>measuring</em> or <em>scoring</em> designs in a scientifically rigorous way - as we would love to see people engage with this research and take it further. We believe that algorithmic predictions such as this are a valuable technique that will increasingly be complemented by AI models trained from large-scale datasets reflecting the human experience of architecture.</p>
