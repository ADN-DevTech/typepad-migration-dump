<p>I clicked on through to <a href="http://www.chromeweblab.com" target="_blank">the Chrome Web Lab</a> from the Google home-page, yesterday. It contains some cool “experiments” that showcase the capabilities of modern web-browsers (and presumably Google Chrome, in particular).</p>  <p>The one that especially caught my interest was number 3, <a href="http://www.chromeweblab.com/en-GB/sketchbots" target="_blank">the Sketchbots experiment</a>:</p>  <br /><iframe height="264" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3HnO2wSyYuI?rel=0" frameborder="0" width="470" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>  <br />  <br />  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2017d40a1bf7f970c-pi" target="_blank"><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; float: right; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="My processed portrait" border="0" alt="My processed portrait" align="right" src="/assets/image_744377.jpg" width="138" height="181" /></a>The experiment starts with an uploaded photo or – and this is what I did, in my case – a snapshot taken from your system’s webcam. Some image processing and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision" target="_blank">computer vision</a> techniques then get applied to it – essentially to perform edge detection and convert those edges to vectors – and the resultant sketch gets placed in a queue to be drawn in sand at the Science Museum in London. I queued mine up late afternoon in Switzerland, and as the queue took around 2.5 hours to get through (for 400+ sketches, I think it was), the museum was closed by the time it got drawn. </p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2017d40a1bfbe970c-pi" target="_blank"><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="The sketch in progress" border="0" alt="The sketch in progress" src="/assets/image_66618.jpg" width="462" height="398" /></a></p>  <p>Not that it mattered, though, as I was able to capture a few snaps online of the sketch in progress (here’s one, above) and a pretty cool YouTube video gets composited and shared once complete:</p>  <br /><iframe height="264" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lDFoySo1QXA?rel=0" frameborder="0" width="470" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>  <br />  <br />  <p>This kind of analog –&gt; digital –&gt; analog transition (atoms –&gt; bits –&gt; atoms as <a href="http://twitter.com/chr1sa" target="_blank">Chris Anderson</a> <a href="http://www.wired.com/magazine/2010/01/ff_newrevolution/" target="_blank">might say</a>) is really very interesting, and is exactly the kind of process our Reality Capture team is focusing on (although for 3D rather than 2D). You may have heard or read <a href="http://www.sensysmag.com/spatialsustain/the-disruption-of-rip-mix-burn-as-it-relates-to-design.html" target="_blank">Brian Mathews talking about Rip-Mod-Burn</a> (similar to Rip-Mix-Burn for music and video), for instance.</p>  <p>Maybe we need a web-connected 3D printer in <a href="http://usa.autodesk.com/gallery" target="_blank">The Gallery</a>, churning out miniature replicas of models created using <a href="http://www.123dapp.com/catch" target="_blank">123D Catch</a>? The advantage of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_rock_garden" target="_blank">drawing in sand</a> is that it’s clearly highly sustainable, although perhaps innovations like <a href="http://www.wired.com/design/2013/01/filabot-plastic-recycler/" target="_blank">the Filabot</a> wouldn’t make a 3D version quite so bad, after all. But the scope for abuse would be pretty huge, of course: I can well imagine college students staying up late capturing fun vistas for replication in 3D. I’m pretty sure I would have.</p>  <p><strong><em>Update:</em></strong></p>  <p>I didn’t realise it was possible to get <a href="http://goo.gl/GonVP" target="_blank">an image of the finished sketch</a> (I was just sent <a href="http://goo.gl/we4V0" target="_blank">a link to the video</a>). <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2013/01/google-chrome-web-labs-sketchbots-bits-to-atoms-zen-style.html?cid=6a00d83452464869e2017c367abad8970b#comment-6a00d83452464869e2017c367abad8970b" target="_blank">Tilo’s comment</a> helped me work out how to get it (even if it was reverse-engineered from the expanded version of the link he gave me). Here’s the snap – for some reason it reminds me of Salvador Dali, so I’ve included one of him, too. :-)</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2017d40a98bdd970c-pi" target="_blank"><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; margin: 0px 10px 0px 15px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; float: left; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="Finished sand-sketch" border="0" alt="Finished sand-sketch" align="left" src="/assets/image_712059.jpg" width="218" height="290" /></a><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2017ee81e5e7c970d-pi" target="_blank"><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; float: left; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="Salvador Dali" border="0" alt="Salvador Dali" align="left" src="/assets/image_61400.jpg" width="220" height="291" /></a></p>
