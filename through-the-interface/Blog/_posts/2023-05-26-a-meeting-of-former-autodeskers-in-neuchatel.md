<p>Yesterday evening I popped along to <a href="https://www.restaurant-lacantine.ch/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">La Cantine</a> in Colombier to attend a get-together of former Autodesk Neuchâtel employees. I was only expecting a few people to be there, but there must have been somewhere between 50 and 100 of my former colleagues there during the course of the evening.</p>
<p>La Cantine is a restaurant run by an old friend and former Autodesker, Antonio Barroca, and <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2020/07/a-swiss-staycation.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">I’ve mentioned both Antonio and his restaurant in the past</a>. If you’re ever in the Neuchâtel region, do stop by for some great food with a wonderful atmosphere. Here’s Antonio fanning the flames of one of his outdoor grills. As you can see, his restaurant is on the edge of wide open space - in fact it's an airfield from where Antonio has done many, many glider flights - so it’s a perfect place to enjoy a party.</p>

<p>I was completely overwhelmed at getting the chance to catch up with so many old friends.</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" target="_blank" href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202b6853887be200d-pi" rel="noopener"><img alt="Lots of old friends" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83452464869e202b6853887be200d img-responsive" src="/assets/image_374301.jpg" style="width: 500px; display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Lots of old friends" /></a></p>
<p>There were many people I hadn't seen in years, and a few I hadn't seen in decades.<a class="asset-img-link" target="_blank" href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202b6853887cb200d-pi" rel="noopener"><img alt="A great atmosphere" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83452464869e202b6853887cb200d img-responsive" src="/assets/image_462146.jpg" style="width: 500px; display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="A great atmosphere" /></a></p>
<p>I've met many Autodeskers, over the years, and one thing I've found to be nearly universally true is that they're just great people. Autodesk Neuchâtel was a magical time for many of us, and having this chance to reconnect and relive some of the fun was a real gift.</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" target="_blank" href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202b751819624200b-pi" rel="noopener"><img alt="A blast from the past" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83452464869e202b751819624200b img-responsive" src="/assets/image_226584.jpg" style="width: 500px; display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="A blast from the past" /></a></p>
<p>Everywhere I looked I was surprised to see more faces of people I recognised.</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" target="_blank" href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202b751a5f853200c-pi" rel="noopener"><img alt="Inside and out" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83452464869e202b751a5f853200c img-responsive" src="/assets/image_126256.jpg" style="width: 500px; display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Inside and out" /></a></p>
<p>While I see Anna quite regularly - we're neighbours - I hadn't seen Alain in over a decade. (He was one of the first people I met at Autodesk Neuchâtel, back in the day.)</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" target="_blank" href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202b6853887cd200d-pi" rel="noopener"><img alt="Anna and Alain" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83452464869e202b6853887cd200d img-responsive" src="/assets/image_809479.jpg" style="width: 500px; display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Anna and Alain" /></a></p>
<p>Not everyone was ex-Autodesk, of course (myself included). Perhaps it's safer to think of ourselves as future ex-Autodeskers. ;-)</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" target="_blank" href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202b6853887d0200d-pi" rel="noopener"><img alt="Aurelia and Raphael" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83452464869e202b6853887d0200d img-responsive" src="/assets/image_734112.jpg" style="height: 500px; display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Aurelia and Raphael" /></a></p>
<p>Antonio put on a special menu for those who stayed to eat.</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" target="_blank" href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202b6853887d7200d-pi" rel="noopener"><img alt="It was lovely" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83452464869e202b6853887d7200d img-responsive" src="/assets/image_80402.jpg" style="width: 500px; display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="It was lovely" /></a></p>
<p>Unfortunately I'd made other evening plans, so left as people were sitting down. Next time I'll try to manage things better.</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" target="_blank" href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202b751a5f858200c-pi" rel="noopener"><img alt="Having dinner" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83452464869e202b751a5f858200c img-responsive" src="/assets/image_522107.jpg" style="width: 500px; display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Having dinner" /></a></p>
<p>It was a lovely evening with great company. I hope it happens again sometime soon, as it was simply impossible to catch up with everyone.</p>

<p>Many thanks to Yann Grobon for taking the initiative to make this happen. I expect many people will see familiar faces in this post - it would be great to read your favourite memories of this time, if you have time to leave a comment.</p>
