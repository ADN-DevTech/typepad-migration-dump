<p>Some of you may have noticed a few changes that have been made to this blog over the last week or so.</p>  <p>Firstly, I finally got around to implementing per-page sharing – for now via Twitter, Facebook, Google+ and LinkedIn – for individual blog posts. This took me longer than I’d have liked because I use <a href="http://help.typepad.com/overview_of_advanced_templates.html" target="_blank">Typepad Advanced Templates</a> (which means I do a lot of hand-hacking of HTML to implement new features, giving more flexibility but requiring more work to do anything significant).</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201a73d95cebb970d-pi" target="_blank"><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 20px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="Sharing buttons" border="0" alt="Sharing buttons" src="/assets/image_797090.jpg" width="470" height="39" /></a></p>  <p>If there are other social networks you’d like to share to – Pinterest, anyone? – then please post a comment to let me know.</p>  <p>Speaking of comments: subsequent to <a href="http://everything.typepad.com/blog/2014/03/announcing-disqus-integration-for-typepad.html" target="_blank">Typepad’s announcement earlier this month</a> of their support for <a href="http://disqus.com" target="_blank">Disqus</a> commenting (pronounced “discuss” rather than “discus”, <a href="https://twitter.com/disqus/status/294982019774050304" target="_blank">it seems</a>), I went ahead and implemented the system for this blog. I haven’t looked especially deeply into the features it provides, but I had been received the occasional complaint about the previous commenting system (apart from anything else I had a lot of valid comments getting flagged as spam without any notification, which annoyed me intensely) and Disqus does appear to be “best in class” for blog comments, generally. Let me know what you think.</p>  <p>I imported the blog’s previous comments, but these appear to have come across without threading (such is life – hopefully that won’t detract too much from the usefulness of older comments). New comments will be fully threaded, of course.</p>  <p>This is a one way conversion, unless I choose to discard comments that have come in via Disqus. If anyone finds it particularly objectionable, it would be great to hear that sooner rather than later.</p>
