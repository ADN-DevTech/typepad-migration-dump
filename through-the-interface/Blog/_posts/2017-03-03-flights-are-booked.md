<p>We’ve crossed a pretty big milestone in the plans for <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2017/02/through-the-interface-goes-around-the-world.html" target="_blank">my family’s round the world trip</a> for the latter half of 2017: we’ve actually booked flights. Here’s how the latest location tracker looks:</p> <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b7c8dc11ca970b-pi" target="_blank"><img title="Round the world itinerary shaping up" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 30px auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="Round the world itinerary shaping up" src="/assets/image_185782.jpg" width="500" height="201"></a></p> <p>You can compare this with the more speculative plan from last time – which still holds good for most areas – to get a sense for the timing and flow. <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b7c8dc11d2970b-pi" target="_blank"><img title="Around the world, around the wor-uld" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 30px auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="Around the world, around the wor-uld" src="/assets/image_309415.jpg" width="500" height="245"></a></p> <p>The first image includes prospective destinations reached overland – we’ll be renting cars/RVs/motor-homes in various locations, as well as taking a fair amount of public ground transportation. We’re crossing our fingers that the bus from Salta, Argentina to San Pedro de Atacama, Chile – an apparently spectacular journey over the Andes – is going to be running in mid-September. All part of the adventure, I suppose.</p> <p>Many thanks to all of you who have emailed/posted suggestions for the trip. Some destinations haven’t made the latest cut – one I’m particularly sad about is that we won’t have time to do both Yellowstone and Vancouver; Yellowstone ended up winning that one. Although as that’s an overland segment, there’s still some chance we’ll rethink and make it work (at which point the information you kindly provided, Mike Ponti, will still come in handy – thanks again!).</p> <p>It’s nice things are moving forward. This is a big step to have taken: we’re still worried we’ve been too aggressive on the number of destinations for a 6-month trip, but one way or another it’ll all work out, I’m sure.</p> <p>At some point in the coming weeks I’ll share some more specific dates with people, to help with planning face-to-face encounters. In the meantime there are lots of logistics we still have to work through, of course. Onwards!</p>
