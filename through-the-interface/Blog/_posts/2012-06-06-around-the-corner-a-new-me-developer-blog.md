<p>A long-time friend, colleague and worldwide M&amp;E Manager for ADN, Cyrille Fauvel, has started <a href="http://around-the-corner.typepad.com" target="_blank">Around the Corner</a>, a blog focused on developing with Autodesk Maya, MotionBuilder, Mudbox and FBX. A member of Cyrille’s team, Kristine Middlemiss, who co-authors <a href="http://mayastation.typepad.com" target="_blank">the popular Maya Station blog</a>, will also be co-authoring this new blog.</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20167671c737d970b-pi" target="_blank"><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; margin: 20px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="Around the Corner" border="0" alt="Around the Corner" src="/assets/image_435173.jpg" width="466" height="103" /></a></p>  <p>For anyone interested in developing with Autodesk’s Media and Entertainment products, this is going to be an extremely valuable resource: these two really know their stuff.</p>  <p>Welcome to the blogosphere, Cyrille, and well done for contributing to a second blog, Kristine! :-)</p>
