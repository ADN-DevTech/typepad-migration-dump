<p>A quick reminder about the deadline for <a href="http://promoshq.wildfireapp.com/website/6/contests/296215" target="_blank">the AU APPHACK</a> that I mentioned in <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2012/10/apphack-au-2012.html" target="_blank">this previous post</a> is <strong>today, November 14th</strong>.</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2017c3378a175970b-pi" target="_blank"><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 20px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="AppHack at AU 2012" border="0" alt="AppHack at AU 2012" src="/assets/image_374797.jpg" width="304" height="254" /></a>There are some great prizes on offer, and you may not even have to write a single line of code between now and AU to win a prize (if you have a cool project that works with AutoCAD 2013 currently in development – ideally with some kind of cloud integration to keep within the theme of the contest – this is a fantastic opportunity to get both a reward and some great visibility).</p>  <p>You do need to be an ADN member and able to be present in Las Vegas just prior to AU on November 26th. Be sure to read <a href="http://promoshq.wildfireapp.com/website/6/contests/296215/rules" target="_blank">the full rules</a> before submitting.</p>
