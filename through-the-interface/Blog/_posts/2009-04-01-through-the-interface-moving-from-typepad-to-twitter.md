<p>As of tomorrow, I will be transitioning away from posting to this site via TypePad in favour of micro-blogging via the increasingly-popular Twitter service. If you would like to follow me on Twitter, you can do so via <a href="http://twitter.com/keanw">http://twitter.com/keanw</a>.</p>  <p>Any lengthy monologues (and yes, I know I’m prone to these, from time to time :-) will either be condensed down to 140 characters or serialized over multiple tweets. The same holds for code samples: I expect this to force me to be more disciplined about keeping my code succinct (although on the downside I plan on completely eradicating comments and error-checking from my code).</p>  <p>In case you’re interested by the motivation behind this shift, I was inspired by <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2009/apr/01/guardian-twitter-media-technology">this recently-announced move by The Guardian newspaper</a>.</p>  <p>Happy <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_Fools%27_Day">April Fools’ Day</a>! :-)</p>
