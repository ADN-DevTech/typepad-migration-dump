<p>I’ve been waiting for this one to be published, as I’ve been working very closely with the team that has been developing this particular integration: <a href="http://labs.autodesk.com/utilities/falcon" target="_blank">Project Falcon for AutoCAD</a> is <a href="http://labs.blogs.com/its_alive_in_the_lab/2012/12/project-falcon-for-autocad-now-available.html" target="_blank">now available on Autodesk Labs</a>.</p>
<p>The integration is really impressive: they’ve managed to really push the limits of the AutoCAD transient graphics API with some pretty incredible results.</p>

<p>They’ve used a number of techniques that have also been shared on this blog to get the application working. It’s hard to do it justice with pictures – download it for 64-bit AutoCAD and take it for a spin!</p>

<p>Now if I could only get a 3D model of <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2012/12/midlife-crisis-planning.html" target="_blank">the Morgan 3 Wheeler</a> – I’d love to see how that performs in a virtual wind tunnel… :-)</p>
