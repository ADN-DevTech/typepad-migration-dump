<p>I arrived yesterday morning in Singapore, coming in on a Singapore Airlines <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbus_A380" target="_blank">A380</a> from Zurich. It was a great flight, as far as long-hauls in economy go: comfortable seats with a great choice of films to watch (my favourite on this leg being “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_Atlas_(film)" target="_blank">The Cloud Atlas</a>”, an excellent adaptation of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_Atlas_(novel)" target="_blank">a brilliant novel</a> lent to me by <a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com" target="_blank">Jeremy Tammik</a> a couple of years ago). I even managed to catch an hour or two of sleep, which is surprising for a daytime flight, even if it landed at 6am local time in Singapore.</p>  <p>I rested for a few hours at the hotel in Singapore before wandering out and about with an old school friend who came down for the day from Kuala Lumpur. We ended up having dinner overlooking <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marina_Bay_Sands" target="_blank">the Marina Bay Sands</a>, an impressive addition to the Singapore skyline (at least since I last visited the city-state, which I was figuring must have been about 7-8 years ago):</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201910214ccf4970c-pi" target="_blank"><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 20px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="The Marina Bay Sands in Singapore" border="0" alt="The Marina Bay Sands in Singapore" src="/assets/image_693981.jpg" width="480" height="282" /></a></p>  <p>Today was a meeting day, spent discussing various topics with teams here in Singapore. One of the more exciting sessions was with the Reality Capture team – led by my old friend and ADN colleague, Murali Pappoppula – who’s working on some incredibly interesting technology to be put on Autodesk Labs, later in the year. Watch this space, I’ll be blogging about it the day it’s public.</p>  <p>I’m now heading off for dinner, over which I’ll find out what’s going on with DesignScript (Robert Aish and Luke Church also happen to be visiting Singapore, this week, so it’s a good opportunity to catch up on what’s happening there). More soon!</p>
