<p>You’re hopefully by now familiar with <a href="http://apps.123dapp.com/catch" target="_blank">123D Catch</a> – a technology <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2012/05/new-versions-of-123d-catch-for-web-and-ipad.html" target="_blank">I’ve talked about before</a>, a consumer-focused tool for reconstructing 3D models from photos – but Autodesk is also providing a professional-grade version of the system on Autodesk 360 called <a href="http://autodesk.com/recap" target="_blank">Autodesk ReCap Photo</a>.</p>  <p>To get access to the trial version of this tool, simply log in to <a href="https://360.autodesk.com" target="_blank">Autodesk 360</a> and upload some photos of the scene you’d like to capture. You can then multi-select the photos, right-click and select “Create 3D model”. You’ll be presented with the “photo-to-3D settings” window that allows you to enter the name for the project and select options such as the quality of the output and the target formats (.RCS, .OBJ, .FBX and/or .IPM). You can also enable the “advanced settings” toggle to be able to register reference points/distances to generate a scale model as well as to specify which photos should be used for texture generation.</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2019102a0f705970c-pi" target="_blank"><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; margin: 20px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="Autodesk ReCap Photo photo-to-3D settings" border="0" alt="Autodesk ReCap Photo photo-to-3D settings" src="/assets/image_391692.jpg" width="470" height="334" /></a></p>  <p>For more detailed information on using ReCap Photo – as well as some sample projects – see <a href="https://360-rc.autodesk.com/lightbox/index.html" target="_blank">this page</a>. You might also want to check out the <a href="http://feedback.autodesk.com/cloudservices/products/cloudservices_recap" target="_blank">forum for ReCap Photo</a> (and <a href="http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/Autodesk-ReCap/ct-p/450" target="_blank">for ReCap Studio</a>) to ask any questions you might have or just see what others are saying.</p>  <p>Here’s a video on taking the right pictures for use with ReCap Photo, which is comparable to advice we’ve given for 123D Catch (and the Photo Scene Editor, before it).</p>  <br/> <p><iframe height="264" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vPIZlcwZQJM?rel=0" frameborder="0" width="470" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p> <br/>  <p>Another nostalgic aside (these seem to be happening a lot, lately – <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2013/04/40-and-a-day.html" target="_blank">hitting 40</a> has no doubt triggered them): the voiceover in the above video makes me think of “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_Skidmore" target="_blank">our Graham</a>”, the person doing the voice-over from the classic UK game show <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_Date_(UK_TV_series)" target="_blank">Blind Date</a>. To see what I mean, check <a href="http://youtu.be/VPkh8lxnxmQ?t=5m30s" target="_blank">this YouTube video</a> of a special <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comic_Relief" target="_blank">Comic Relief</a> episode featuring <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Bean" target="_blank">Mr. Bean</a> (and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Cumming" target="_blank">the actor who now plays Eli Gould</a> in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Good_Wife" target="_blank">The Good Wife</a> – wow, he’s a Scot!).</p>  <p>Here’s a voiceover-less video of a 3D model of the “launch cake”, captured (of course) using ReCap Photo:</p> <br/> <p><iframe height="264" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/x88LuDkEUKs?rel=0" frameborder="0" width="470" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p> <br/>  <p>Incidentally, if you’re an <a href="http://autodesk.com/joinadn" target="_blank">ADN member</a> who’s interested in working with this technology, check your inbox for a recent DevNews on the topic.
