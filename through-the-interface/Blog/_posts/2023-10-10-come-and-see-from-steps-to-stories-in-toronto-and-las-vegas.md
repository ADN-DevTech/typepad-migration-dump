<p>I’m very excited that our partners at <a href="https://thebentway.ca/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Bentway</a> have announced the upcoming exhibition they’re hosting that will showcase work being done by <a href="https://research.autodesk.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Autodesk Research</a>. Here is some information on The Bentway from <a href="https://thebentway.ca/about/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">their web-site</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Anchored under Toronto’s Gardiner Expressway and guiding its complex future, The Bentway is a growing public space, and much more. We are a new type of civic organization: a not-for-profit, powered by vital partnerships with the City of Toronto, residents, supporters, artists, city-builders, and dreamers. The Bentway is a creative catalyst rooted in experimentation, leading a creative movement to re-imagine the opportunities of urban spaces.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We’ve been running “walkshops” at The Bentway during the summer using technology integrated into a helmet (alongside a mobile phone) to capture the experience people have when using the space.</p>

<p>This feeds into our efforts on <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2022/09/human-centric-building-design.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">human-centric building design</a>, as capturing data on the human experience of architectural (and in this case urban) spaces is an important component of our work.</p>

<p>The exhibition where we’ll present the results of this effort is called <a href="https://thebentway.ca/event/from-steps-to-stories/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">From Steps to Stories</a> and will run from November 4th-9th 2023 at The Bentway Studio on Fort York Boulevard in Toronto. There’s also a <a href="https://thebentway.ca/event/from-steps-to-stories-public-opening/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">special opening night on November 3rd</a> where you can meet members of the Autodesk Research&#0160;team who have worked on the project. It’s free to attend, you just need to <a href="https://www.universe.com/events/from-steps-to-stories-public-opening-tickets-PF3W21" rel="noopener" target="_blank">RSVP</a>.<a href="/assets/image_650491.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Walking The Bentway" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_650491.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto 5px;" title="Walking The Bentway" width="500" /></a></p>

<p>I’ll be sharing more information about this exhibition in due course, but in the meantime here’s a sneak peek of the kind of graphics you can expect to see. (The visuals I’ve seen that we’re expecting to include in the final exhibit are amazing - I’m really looking forward to taking the experience exploration system for a spin!)</p>

<p>If you’re not going to be in Toronto during this period - but are planning on attending Autodesk University 2023 in Las Vegas - then you will also be able to visit a version of the exhibit there.</p>
<p>And not only that, we’re planning on bringing a number of our data capture helmets along to Vegas, and will be working closely with the AU team to capture data on people&#39;s experience in the expo hall. It should be a lot of fun!</p>
