<p>The AU team has announced the dates for Autodesk University 2022: it will be held from <span style="font-weight: bold;">September 27-29, 2022</span>, and – barring some regression in the current health situation – in-person for the first time since Autodesk University 2019! I can also reveal that we’ll be meeting in a city that isn’t Las Vegas. (Sorry to not say more about this, but we’ve been asked not to talk specifically about where’s it’s being held, for now.)</p>
<p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202942f9c0b09200c-pi" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img width="500" height="331" title="Autodesk University logo" style="margin: 30px auto; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Autodesk University logo" src="/assets/image_976865.jpg" border="0"></a></p>
<p>This is clearly earlier than the usual November/December timeframe, so the Call For Proposals (CFP) will logically be held that much sooner. In fact the CFP starts in just a few weeks – on <strong>March 15th</strong> – and will run for a month – until April 15th.</p>
<p>There will be a bit of a change in the way classes are held, this year: hands-on labs are not being held due to health &amp; safety concerns (a bit disappointing but a totally understandable compromise, under the circumstances) and there will be a new “case study” category, which I expect to be both interesting and very popular.</p>
<p>Voting on classes will be open until <strong>April 25th</strong>, with the selection decisions being announced in late May. As the voting will be taken into account during the selection process, it’s definitely worth submitting your classes as early as you can.</p>
<p>I’m likely to submit classes on VASA and/or Dasher (I didn’t present anything last year, so there’s definitely lots to talk about). I’ll post an update once I’ve submitted my proposals, of course.</p>
