<p><em>Thanks to Kristine Middlemiss, from our DevTech Media &amp; Entertainment team, for bringing this very cool application to my attention.</em></p>  <p>There a few Visual Studio Add-Ins that I can no longer do without. I use <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2006/08/some_cool_copyp.html" target="_blank">CopySourceAsHtml</a> for every blog post of mine that includes source code, and I’m now just beginning to form a similar dependency on <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/IntroducingRockScroll.aspx" target="_blank">RockScroll</a>. This Add-In integrates with Visual Studio (in my case 2008, as I’m typically slow to install the latest &amp; greatest VS release) to display a thumbnail view of your current source file in a fattened, still perfectly functional scrollbar:</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20133f34e68c4970b-pi"><img style="border-right-width: 0px; margin: 20px auto; display: block; float: none; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" title="RockScroll in action" border="0" alt="RockScroll in action" src="/assets/image_521061.jpg" width="475" height="238" /></a>This tool is very useful, indeed, when navigating very large source files.</p>
