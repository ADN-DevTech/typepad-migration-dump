<p>Now that I’ve recovered from this week’s trip to Paris – and from both the pleasure and the shock of seeing people physically in <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=meatspace" rel="noopener" target="_blank">meatspace</a> – it’s time to look ahead to another trip.</p>
<p>The Developer Advocacy and Support team have <a href="https://forge.autodesk.com/blog/announcing-forge-data-days-global-event-series" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announced a new worldwide event tour</a> where they’ll be talking to people about the upcoming <a href="https://forge.autodesk.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Forge</a> Data platform.</p>
<p>Here are the dates that were confirmed at the time of writing this post:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Europe</strong></li>
<ul>
<li>May 31st | Munich, Germany</li>
<li>June 2nd | Gothenburg, Sweden</li>
<li>June 7th | Birmingham, UK</li>
<li>June 9th | Milan, Italy</li>
<li>June 14th | Barcelona, Spain</li>
</ul>
<li><strong>Americas</strong></li>
<ul>
<li>June 21st | Detroit, Michigan</li>
<li>June 23rd | Boston, Massachusetts</li>
<li>June 28th | Denver, Colorado</li>
<li>June 30th | San Francisco, California</li>
</ul>
<li><strong>Asia Pacific</strong></li>
<ul>
<li>July 29th | Tokyo, Japan</li>
<li>August 1st |Singapore</li>
<li>August 3rd | Bangalore, India</li>
<li>August 5th | Pune, India</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>These cities should be scheduled before too long – and may well have been updated in the linked blog post by the time you read this – in case you’re closer to one of them:</p>
<ul>
<li>São Paulo, Brazil</li>
<li>Beijing, China</li>
<li>Shanghai, China</li>
<li>Shenzhen, China</li>
<li>Taipei, Taiwan</li>
<li>Sydney, Australia</li>
</ul>
<p>I’m going to try to make at least one of the stops (probably one of the European cities), schedule-permitting. If you sign up for a particular stop on the tour and would like to meet up, please let me know! (I can’t guarantee I’ll get to the city you chose, but it’ll certainly influence my decision on which to choose myself.)</p>
