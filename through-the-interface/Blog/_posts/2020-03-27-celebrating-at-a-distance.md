<p>We’ve just finished celebrating the 20th anniversary of a dear friend and colleague, Clayton Hotson, joining Autodesk. We were in the same team, way back when Clayton joined, both working from our San Rafael office.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2025d9b410fbb200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Back in the day" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Back in the day" src="/assets/image_479997.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Over the years we’ve ended up doing other things, but in the last few months have happily found ourselves back together in the Research Engineering team (the awesome group that was responsible for incubating Dreamcatcher…. it’s a serious honour to be working with this team).</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a51b0573200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="312" title="Clayton hits 20" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Clayton hits 20" src="/assets/image_356493.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Anyway, today we got together and had a surprise celebration for Clayton. We dug up some photos of Clayton etc. for virtual backgrounds and got together for a drink. It was 7pm for me, so wine was fine, which wasn’t super-fair on our Bay Area colleagues. But hey.</p><p>Many hearty congratulations to my old buddy Clayton. Let’s hope we’re working together for many years to come!</p>
