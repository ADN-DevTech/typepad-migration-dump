<p>Despite having worked for some time with a number of language features previewed for VS2008 and properly released in VS2010 (F# being a prime example), I’ve finally gotten around to installing VS2010 as my main .NET code development environment.</p>
<p>To make sure I could get code across properly into my blog, I was able to get <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2006/08/some_cool_copyp.html" target="_blank">my favourite source code copying tool</a>, <a href="http://copysourceashtml.codeplex.com/" target="_blank">CopySourceAsHTML</a>, <a href="http://blogs.microsoft.co.il/blogs/applisec/archive/2010/02/25/copyashtml-in-visual-studio-2010.aspx" target="_blank">working in Visual Studio 2010</a>.</p>
<p>And thanks to tips from <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/CADbloke" target="_blank">Ewen Wallace</a> and Scott McFarlane, I upgraded <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2010/08/rockscroll-my-new-favourite-visual-studio-add-in.html" target="_blank">my use of RockScroll</a> to switch across to <a href="http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/465a0d53-5133-4edd-a0cd-94484fe3d853/" target="_blank">AllMargins</a> (which includes the particularly handy OverviewMargin tool, as seen at the right of the below VS2010 screenshot).</p>
<p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2014e5fed6edb970c-pi"><img alt="AllMargins in VS2010" border="0" height="410" src="/assets/image_53223.jpg" style="background-image: none; margin: 20px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="AllMargins in VS2010" width="419" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/#!/owenwengerd" target="_blank">Owen Wengerd</a> has recommended installing <a href="http://daffodil.codeplex.com/" target="_blank">Daffodil</a>, which enables VS2010 to multi-target VS versions prior to 2008. <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/vcblog/archive/2009/12/08/c-native-multi-targeting.aspx" target="_blank">VS2010 can use VS2008</a> to build apps for AutoCAD 2010 &amp; 2011, as long as you have VS2008 installed, but Daffodil apparently allows you to build C++ applications using prior versions of Visual Studio, and therefore build ObjectARX applications for prior versions of AutoCAD. I very rarely have to do any C++ coding, these days – especially not for older AutoCAD versions – but I’ll file that one away until it’s needed (thanks, Owen! :-).</p>
