<p>I wasn’t sure whether I would stick with the Atari 2600 for this week’s Floppy Friday, but as I received a new batch of floppies by post at lunchtime, I decided to dig in and see what was there.</p>
<p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2026bdecd322a200c-pi" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="More floppies" border="0" height="354" src="/assets/image_568247.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="More floppies" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>After initially loading <a href="https://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=559" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Create with Garfield!</a> (and no, I won’t be loading that one again), I fell upon a single diskette with a pretty interesting little collection of games, and ended up just loading a handful of them. Here’s <a href="https://youtu.be/xrr3dNVVZmM" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the episode</a>:</p>

<p><br /></p>
<p>We started by playing <a href="http://www.gamebase64.com/game.php?id=539" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Back to Nature</a> (also known as “Frog”), and then a strange little game called <a href="http://www.gb64.com/game.php?id=7201" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Spider</a>. Then the arcade classic, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frogger" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Frogger</a> and a game called <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/c64/fast-eddie" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Fast Eddie</a>. And we wrapped up the set with a couple of moon-centric (or at least space-centric) games, <a href="https://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=1707" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Moon Buggy</a> (apparently a pretty poor clone of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon_Patrol" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Moon Patrol</a>) and <a href="https://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=1712" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Moon Shuttle</a>.</p>
<p>I really enjoyed the last one for its sound effects (which may or may not have been clear on the video recording), but it was hugely disliked by the critics, if <a href="http://www.zzap64.co.uk/cgi-bin/displaypage.pl?issue=015&amp;page=108&amp;thumbstart=0&amp;magazine=zzap" rel="noopener" target="_blank">this Zzap! 64 review</a> is anything to go by:</p>

<p>That’s it for this week. See you next time!</p>
