<p>My old friend Volker Joseph, over on <a href="http://dwf.blogs.com/" target="_blank">Beyond the Paper</a>, wrote recently about a planned <a href="http://dwf.blogs.com/beyond_the_paper/2008/03/api-overhaul.html" target="_blank">overhaul of the Autodesk Design Review API</a>.</p>

<p>If you currently use the ADR API, please be sure to check the list of interfaces that are slated for removal and let Volker know of any you consider important.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
