<p>This is likely to be somewhat &quot;off-topic&quot; for the majority of this blog&#39;s readership, but anyway, here goes. (It turns out an increasing number of traditional CAD customers are making use of adjacent visualization applications, so I&#39;m sure there are some people out there who will find this of interest... :-)</p>
<p>Many of you have probably heard (or read) me mention, by now, that my team (DevTech) is responsible for providing a variety of technical services for members of the Autodesk Developer Network (ADN). What many of you may not know is that this covers pretty much all Autodesk&#39;s &quot;platform&quot; products (products that expose programming interfaces and can be used as development platforms). This includes a number of our Media &amp; Entertainment products, such as <a href="http://www.autodesk.com/3dsmax">3ds Max</a>, <a href="http://www.autodesk.com/maya">Maya</a>, <a href="http://www.autodesk.com/motionbuilder">MotionBuilder</a> and even the newly acquired <a href="http://www.autodesk.com/softimage">SoftImage</a> products (or at least it&#39;s likely to be the case once the dust settles, which may take some time).</p>
<p>The DevTech M&amp;E team is putting together some online training for 3ds Max, Maya and MotionBuilder, and what&#39;s interesting about it - aside from the fact it&#39;s <strong><em>completely free</em></strong> for anyone to join - is that it&#39;s being held during just 1 hour per day over a 10-day period. This is the first time we&#39;ve tried something like this, so I&#39;m very interested to see how it works.</p>
<p>As always, our online training catalog is available <a href="http://www.autodesk.com/apitraining">here</a>, and if you want to go straight to the schedule &amp; registration page, <a href="http://www.adskconsulting.com/adn/cs/api_course_sched.php">here it is</a>.</p>
<p>Here are the dates and the direct registration links. Once again, each class is held over 10 days, with 1 hour of webcast per day:</p>

<p>If you&#39;d like more information on the contents and timing (right now I&#39;m not even sure <em>which</em> hour per day needs to be reserved :-), let me know and I&#39;ll find out.</p>
