<p>I’m currently putting the finishing touches on my material for Autodesk University 2019. To encourage a few last-minute sign-ups, here are a few teaser GIFs from my classes.</p><p>The first is from <a href="https://autodeskuniversity.smarteventscloud.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=322469" target="_blank">the class on Project Rediscover</a> (which is apparently now full at 109 sign-ups, so in quite a small room). I used Capturefinery to create a GIF of quite a large Refinery study, but this time highlighting the congestion in a more 3D context.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4e802ce200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="269" title="Showing congestion" style="margin: 30px auto; float: none; display: block;" alt="Showing congestion" src="/assets/image_804793.jpg"></a></p><p>The second is from <a href="https://autodeskuniversity.smarteventscloud.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=322461" target="_blank">the class on Project Dasher</a> – and using Forge for advanced data visualization – which still has 36 spaces in the 190-capacity room. This one is showing how we’ve used a reference bitmap to track mouse movement over sensors in the model, something we’ll discuss in the class.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4c35ae2200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="302" title="Sensor hovering reference image" style="margin: 30px auto; float: none; display: block;" alt="Sensor hovering reference image" src="/assets/image_534746.jpg"></a></p><p>At this stage my last big task is to practice my AU Theater Talk to make sure it fits into the scheduled 12-minute slot. Misquoting Marc Twain, “I didn't have time to create a short presentation, so I created a long one instead.” I have to fix that.</p><p>Otherwise my week at AU is starting to look really busy, as usual. Aside from the 3 presentation slots, I have a focus group and probably upwards of 10 customer meetings to attend. Oh, and 7 different evening events spread across the 3 nights of AU that I’m in Las Vegas for, too. I suppose I should consider those as optional, but they’re always so much fun. :-)</p>
