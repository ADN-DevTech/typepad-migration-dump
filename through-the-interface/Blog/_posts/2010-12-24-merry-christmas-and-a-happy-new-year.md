<p>Thank you all for reading and participating in this blog during 2010. It’s your comments and feedback that make it all worthwhile, at least from my perspective. (<em>“</em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_a_tree_falls_in_a_forest" target="_blank"><em>If a blog post gets written and no-one’s around to read it, why bother spell-checking</em></a><em>?”</em> ;-)</p>  <p>I’m heading off to the Alps this afternoon with my family: we’ve rented a chalet in <a href="http://www.nendaz.ch/" target="_blank">Haute-Nendaz</a> for the week between Christmas and New Year and so I’ll be fully offline until the first week of January.</p>  <p>I hope you all get to enjoy a break – as Autodesk employees do during our “week of rest” – and come back refreshed and ready for some more AutoCAD .NET coding in 2011! :-)</p>  <p><a href="http://www.autodesk.com/card2010/12_16_10_holiday_card_corporate.mp4"><img alt="Season&#39;s Greetings" border="0" height="320" src="/assets/image_650008.jpg" style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 0px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="Season&#39;s Greetings" width="485" /></a></p>
