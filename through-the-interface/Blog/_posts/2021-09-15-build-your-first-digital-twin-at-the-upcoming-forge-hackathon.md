<p>Other that <a href="https://keanw.com/retro-computing" target="_blank">my regular foolings-around with ancient tech</a>, I feel like I’ve been neglecting this blog in recent weeks. That’s all about to change, though, as we enter the busy period leading up to Autodesk University 2021. For one I have some interesting learnings I thought I’d share from some of the <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2021/09/a-minor-make-over-and-a-lot-of-core-work-for-dasher.html" target="_blank">foundational work I’ve been doing on Dasher’s codebase</a>, but there are also some interesting updates for people performing analyses of 2D (and 3D!) spaces. Fun stuff!</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202788048d382200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="250" title="Forge Hackathon at AU2021" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Forge Hackathon at AU2021" src="/assets/image_273063.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>First though, it’s worth reminding people of the <a href="https://forge.autodesk.com/blog/registration-forge-hackathon-au-2021-here" target="_blank">Forge Hackathon</a> that’s around the corner. It starts in just a couple of weeks, and it’s a great opportunity to <a href="https://learnforge.autodesk.io" target="_blank">learn Forge</a> (or showcase what you can do with it, if you’re already a <a href="https://forge.autodesk.com" target="_blank">Forge</a> expert) and have fun building something cool. My favourite prize category is clearly that of “most creative Digital Twin application”, where you can get bonus points for using the <a href="https://forge.autodesk.com/blog/now-available-bim-and-iot-data-integration-using-forges-iot-toolkit" target="_blank">Data Visualization Extension</a> (Project Hyperion, inspired heavily by <a href="https://dasher360.com" target="_blank">Project Dasher</a>). But there are several other prizes up for grabs, in case you’re more into XR, construction, task automation or building games.</p><p><a href="https://forge.autodesk.com/blog/meet-forge-hackathon-2021-judges" target="_blank">The judges have been announced</a>, if you want to check them out. I know at least a few of them, and am very impressed with the all-star line-up the organisers have assembled for this year’s event.</p><p>So please do <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/autodesk-university-2021-forge-hackathon-registration-164015283127" target="_blank">sign up today</a>, if you haven’t already. I have no idea whether the “free swag for the first 100 registrants” offer is still up for grabs, but I expect the window on that is closing quickly if it’s indeed still open. Remembering that it’s free to register, in a sense you’re actually being paid to participate with Autodesk merchandise that’s likely to be sporting <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2021/09/a-new-brand-for-a-brand-new-autodesk.html" target="_blank">a fancy new logo</a>.</p><p>And if you do end up wanting to build your own Digital Twin during the Hackathon, please do let me know. I’ll be around during the event and would be happy to give pointers based on my experience working on Dasher.</p>
