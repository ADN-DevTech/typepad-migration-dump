<p>For those of you who haven’t yet signed up, there’s still a little time left to <a href="https://forge.autodesk.com/devcon-germany" rel="noopener" target="_blank">register for this year’s European Forge DevCon</a> being held on <strong>October 14th 2019</strong>, just ahead of AU Germany on October 15th-16th. Once again both events are being held in Darmstadt (a nice town close to Frankfurt, for those who don’t know it). While AU Germany is primarily a German-language event, the Forge DevCon pre-conference is always in English. There’s a modest attendance fee for this year’s event: it costs 160 € per person, for which you get a gourmet dinner, snacks, drinks and a T-shirt.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://forge.autodesk.com/devcon-2019" rel="noopener" target="_blank">agenda is packed with interesting content</a>, as ever, and it’s always a great opportunity to meet helpful people from the Forge team as well as fellow software developers. I very much enjoyed the event last year. Here’s a video showing some of the highlights:</p>

<p>With all that said, I’m not able to attend myself, this year: I’ll be travelling to the UK – first to London, and then to Edinburgh – for <a href="https://www.dbeinstitute.org/event/bilt-europe-2019/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">BiLT Europe</a> during the week before, and will be travelling around the Scottish highlands with my family during the week of AU Germany.</p>
<p>Oh, if you do go along to AU Germany, be sure to check out the exhibit area, where you should be able to experience <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2019/09/a-major-update-to-dasher-360-now-showing-the-nest-building.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">NEST inside Dasher 360</a> on a large touchscreen on the BIM Facility stand. That should be pretty cool. :-)</p>
