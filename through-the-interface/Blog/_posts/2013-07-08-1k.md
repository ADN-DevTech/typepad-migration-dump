<p>This is the 1,000th post to “Through the Interface” – a milestone I mentioned was coming up <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2013/06/7-years-and-a-day.html" target="_blank">a few weeks ago</a>. Which means I’m hitting about 142 posts per year, which is pretty much on target (I aim for 3 posts a week, so that’s about right).</p>  <p>Something that occurred to me, over the weekend, is that it’s often not very easy to discover content contained in the blog: there’s search (which usually seems to work well, but even I have trouble finding posts I’m sure I’ve written, from time to time) and the post indices (“<a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/posts.html" target="_blank">Post Index</a>” and “<a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/reverse.html" target="_blank">Reverse Index</a>” in the left-sash, as well as category- and month-based indices in the right-sash), but I thought it was time to try something different.</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201901e2bcf52970b-pi" target="_blank"><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 0px 10px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; float: right; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="How random" border="0" alt="How random" align="right" src="/assets/image_72219.jpg" width="100" height="300" /></a>I’ve therefore added the “10 Random Posts” section in the right-sash, which picks out and displays a set of random posts from the blog’s content archive every time a page is loaded. This was surprisingly tricky to implement using TypePad: I had to jump through some hoops to generate the information I needed for the various posts and ended up storing hard-coded information on the first 999 posts in the sash itself (anything from 1000 onwards gets added to this list dynamically, so future posts will also be included). </p>  <p>This hopefully won’t impact the blog’s load times too badly: right now it’s an extra 140K of data that needs to be loaded – which doesn’t seem as though it would cause a problem, particularly – but I’m certainly open to switching it off, in case people start to complain (legitimately :-).</p>  <p>Give it a try and let me know if you find it helpful: the tooltip for each link contains the date the post was published, to help you decide whether it’s worth clicking on, or not.</p>
