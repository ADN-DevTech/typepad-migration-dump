<p>I've just come across the announcement for F#, and am pretty excited about it. Here's the link to <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/somasegar/archive/2007/10/17/f-a-functional-programming-language.aspx">Soma's blog</a>, and here's the <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/fsharp/fsharp.aspx">Microsoft Research F# site</a>.</p>

<p>F# is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming">functional programming</a> language. Functional programming has a long association with technical computing, one of the reasons <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_%28programming_language%29">LISP</a> was chosen as the initial programming interface for AutoCAD. On a personal note: aside from the work I've done with LISP over the years, I also studied an obscure functional language called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miranda_programming_language">Miranda</a> during my university days and have since worked a lot with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XSLT">XSLT</a> (which is at least influenced by functional languages).</p>

<p>So I'm keen to get my hands on F# and take it for a spin within AutoCAD (there's nothing to say it won't work, but then I haven't tried it, as yet :-). </p>
