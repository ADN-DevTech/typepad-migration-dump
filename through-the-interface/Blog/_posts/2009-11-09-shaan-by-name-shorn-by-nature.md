<p>OK, I suppose the title only really works if you have a British accent and mispronounce Mr. Hurley’s name, but anyway. :-)</p>  <p>For those of you heading to AU, you may be interested in a rather fun offer being made by Shaan Hurley <a href="http://autodesk.blogs.com/between_the_lines/2009/11/shave-my-head-at-autodesk-university-2009-for-a-good-cause.html">over on his blog</a>. For $2,000 donated to charity (<a href="http://ww5.komen.org/">Susan G. Komen for the Cure</a>, a foundation battling breast cancer) plus 2,000 followers on Twitter, Shaan will let someone shave his head.</p>  <p>I, on the other hand, would let someone shave my head for a <a href="http://www.sierranevada.com/">Sierra Nevada</a> and a $5 casino chip, but then I suppose everyone has their price. And to be fair anyone getting to shave my head would get a lot less out of it (or off of it) than they would shaving Shaan’s.</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20120a666301d970b-pi"><img style="border-right-width: 0px; margin: 0px 10px 0px 30px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" title="Shorn Shaan" border="0" alt="Shorn Shaan" align="right" src="/assets/image_530730.jpg" width="173" height="194" /></a></p>  <p>For fun, here’s a quick artist’s (well, it’s mine – I’m admittedly not much of artist) impression of the end result:</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20120a666301d970b-pi"></a></p>  <p>If you’d prefer to see the real thing, please go ahead and <a href="http://www.info-komen.org/goto/revit3d">make a donation</a> for this very worthy cause and <a href="http://twitter.com/mrcadman">follow Shaan on Twitter</a> (and for those who are interested, <a href="http://twitter.com/keanw">I’m also known to tweet</a>, from time-to-time).</p>
