<p>I attended a student event in Montreux last week, where students from the “<a href="http://www.hes-so.ch" target="_blank">Haute école spécialisée de Suisse occidentale</a>” from various sites in French-speaking Switzerland congregated to visit and find out about prospective employers.</p>
<p>We talked to students about the importance of checking <a href="http://autodesk.com/careers" target="_blank">the Autodesk careers site</a>, of course, but also the fact that students can download and use pretty much the full range of Autodesk software for free* from <a href="http://students.autodesk.com" target="_blank">the Education Community site</a>.</p>
<p>Many of the students I spoke to knew about this already – which was very encouraging, especially as <a href="http://news.autodesk.com/press-release/autodesk-consumer-group-and-education/autodesk-transforms-education-business-model-hel" target="_blank">the public announcement</a> was made just a few weeks ago – but I thought I’d mention it here, as well. This is great news for students around the world! (While the press release specifically mentioned North America, my understanding is that this is a worldwide initiative.)</p>
