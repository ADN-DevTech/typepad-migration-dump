<p>Nate Moore discovered something in a desk drawer that we both thought worth posting: if nothing else because we’d love to find out what on Earth it’s for.</p>
<p>It’s a “computer accessory” – these are literally the only words printed in its box – that looks like it fits a computer’s parallel port (back when computers had them).</p>

<p>The fun thing is that the other side of the plug is sealed!</p>

<p>Maybe you’re meant to pierce and wire in a cable? Or maybe it’s to terminate the port to avoid electrical discharge of some kind?</p>
<p>If anyone has any idea what this is for, please post a comment. I’d be more than happy to ship it to anyone who would like it, but I somehow doubt anyone has a need for it. Do <a href="mailto:kean.walmsley@autodesk.com?subject=I want a computer accessory that blocks my parallel port" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">let me know</a>, in case!</p>
