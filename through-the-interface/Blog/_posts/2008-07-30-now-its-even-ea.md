<p><a href="http://labs.blogs.com/its_alive_in_the_lab/2008/07/project-draw-07.html">Project Draw 0.7.6 is now available</a>, and this release includes the ability to obtain an API key via the web. All you need to do is <a href="http://draw.labs.autodesk.com/labsapi/index.jsp">go to a website</a>, log in to your Autodesk Labs account and fill out the required information:</p>

<p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/WindowsLiveWriter/Getting%20a%20Project%20Draw%20API%20key.png"><img height="317" alt="Getting a Project Draw API key" src="/assets/Getting%20a%20Project%20Draw%20API%20key_thumb.png" width="367" border="0" style="BORDER-TOP-WIDTH: 0px; BORDER-LEFT-WIDTH: 0px; BORDER-BOTTOM-WIDTH: 0px; BORDER-RIGHT-WIDTH: 0px" /></a> </p>

<p>When I submitted my request I received the key back immediately, inside the browser, completely automatically.</p>

<p><a href="http://draw.labs.autodesk.com/labsapi/draw_doc.jsp">The documentation page</a> includes some brief developer documentation, as well as a couple of samples (one server-side Java sample and a client-side VB.NET sample).</p>

<p>Another cool feature of this release is the ability to connect Project Draw designs with Project Freewheel. This means you can insert views on designs hosted on the Project Freewheel server into Project Draw. They come in as stretchable raster images that retain a connection across to the Freewheel model, allowing the user to adjust the view: pan, zoom, even rotate, if in 3D. Very, very cool stuff.</p>
