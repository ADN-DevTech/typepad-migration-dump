<p>It’s that time of year, where our engineering teams release the primary annual updates to our products. <a href="https://blogs.autodesk.com/autocad/autocad-2022/" target="_blank">AutoCAD 2022</a> was released a couple of weeks ago, and <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/products/revit/new-features#revit-2022" target="_blank">Revit 2022</a> dropped yesterday.</p><p>I unfortunately spend very little time in our products, these days, so I’ll leave others to extoll their various benefits. Aside from working with the Forge platform, the product (or perhaps feature-set) I spend the most time with is Dynamo. I’m always happy to see <a href="https://dynamobim.org/dynamo-core-2-11-release/" target="_blank">Sol’s public release announcements</a> on the <a href="https://dynamobim.org/blog/" target="_blank">DynamoBIM blog</a>, both for his unique writing style and the velocity of improvements the team is making to that technology. It’s getting hard to keep up!</p><p>The latest update is Dynamo 2.11, and it comes with <a href="https://github.com/DynamoDS/Dynamo/wiki/Release-Notes" target="_blank">some pretty juicy enhancements</a>.</p><p>There are a number of UX-related changes – such as resizable Watch nodes (albeit the sizing is yet to be serialized to the .DYN file, apparently, something that should come in the future) – and I’m very pleased to see the performance improvements, whether during geometry operations, multi-node graph modification or re-evaluating the graph on Undo/Redo.</p><p>As an extension author, I’m most happy to see the ability to publish <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown" target="_blank">Markdown</a> documentation that <a href="https://github.com/DynamoDS/Dynamo/wiki/Create-and-Add-Custom-Documentation-to-Nodes" target="_blank">integrates with Dynamo’s Documentation Browser</a> but also the ability to <a href="https://github.com/DynamoDS/Dynamo/pull/11347" target="_blank">serialize custom data to the .DYN</a>. Now I just have to a) work on some documentation and b) find something interesting to store in the graph. ;-)</p><p>Here’s a quick GIF from the online documentation showing how Markdown changes can be hot-reloaded by Dynamo 2.11. Very cool stuff.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2026bdec98a5f200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="313" title="Hot reload of Dynamo node documentation" style="margin: 30px auto; float: none; display: block;" alt="Hot reload of Dynamo node documentation" src="/assets/image_421369.jpg"></a></p><p>So there’s lots to be excited about in Dynamo. Given the rapid pace of change, it’s not surprising that the new release of Revit has the previous release of Dynamo (2.10), which has been out there for a little longer. There are still <a href="https://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/revit-products/learn-explore/caas/CloudHelp/cloudhelp/2022/ENU/RevitDynamo/files/RevitDynamo-Whats-New-in-Dynamo-for-Revit-html-html.html" target="_blank">lots of compelling enhancements in that version</a>, so I’m definitely going to be upgrading my Revit installation for working on Dynamo and Generative Design projects.</p><p>And speaking of Generative Design for Revit, here’s a video showing the enhancements to this feature in the 2022 release.</p><p align="center"><br></p><p align="center"><iframe width="500" height="283" title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yv8Kcz1XGBg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"></iframe></p><p><br></p><p>It’s great to see <a href="https://dynamobim.org/generative-design-in-revit-2022-updates/" target="_blank">things moving forward</a>!</p>
