<p>What a great week! The highlight – and that’s from a lot of great moments – was probably the AutoCAD + Kinect session: the demos were clearly fun to do, but there was a high degree of audience participation and we all laughed a lot. For those who weren’t able to attend in person, I’m going to try to find some time to record the demos and upload them to YouTube. Watch this space.</p>  <p>I’m now about to head home to Switzerland. For lots of very good reasons, I’m currently carrying the following electronic devices:</p>  <ul>   <li>MacBook Pro      <ul>       <li>This is currently my main machine </li>     </ul>   </li>    <li>Lenovo ThinkPad T61      <ul>       <li>An old PC I borrowed to run the Kinect SDK/runtime</li>     </ul>   </li>    <li>Kinect     <ul>       <li>For the above-mentioned AU session </li>     </ul>   </li>    <li>iPod Photo     <ul>       <li>An ancient iPod I use for music</li>     </ul>   </li>    <li>Kindle “Keyboard” (as they’re now known)      <ul>       <li>I love to read, and this has been my preferred reading device for some time, now</li>     </ul>   </li>    <li>iPad 2     <ul>       <li>A device I just bought for work purposes in the US </li>     </ul>   </li>    <li>Kindle Fire     <ul>       <li>A device I just bought for fun purposes in the US </li>     </ul>   </li>    <li>BlackBerry Torch 9800      <ul>       <li>The phone work provides (as when you live in Switzerland, you’re roaming more often than not, and BlackBerry still wins on data transfer)</li>     </ul>   </li> </ul>  <p>This is – quite clearly – nuts (and I’m not looking forward to transiting at Heathrow Terminal 5 – it’s going to be “fun” putting all this through security :-).</p>  <p>While some of the above can easily be consolidated (as I’ve just bought some of the items, for instance), it did strike me that while I would have expected to have reduced the number of devices I travel with, by this stage, the reality is somewhat different. Does anyone else feel the same way, or have you all managed to streamline your gadget-load?</p>  <p>Anyway – it was a great AU, and I really enjoyed interacting and hanging out with so many of this blog’s readers. I’m looking forward to next year’s event! :-)</p>
