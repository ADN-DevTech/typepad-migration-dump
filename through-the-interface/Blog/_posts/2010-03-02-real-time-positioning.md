<p>I’m just taking a few days off to visit family in Italy. We’re sitting in a brand-new EuroCity train on its way from Bern to Milano Centrale.</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20120a8edceca970b-pi"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: block; float: none; margin-left: auto; border-top: 0px; margin-right: auto; border-right: 0px" title="EuroCity to Milano" border="0" alt="EuroCity to Milano" src="/assets/image_960480.jpg" width="462" height="308" /></a> </p>  <p>Aside from it being very comfortable – which is new, most of the other times I’ve made this journey have been in cattle-wagons – it’s got one cool feature I hadn’t seen before and simply had to mention: real-time tracking of our progress inside Google Earth displayed on overhead screens inside the cabin. Now you needn’t even look out of the window to see where you are! Simply marvelous!</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201310f549b1a970c-pi"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: block; float: none; margin-left: auto; border-top: 0px; margin-right: auto; border-right: 0px" title="Where we are in Google Earth" border="0" alt="Where we are in Google Earth" src="/assets/image_759017.jpg" width="458" height="307" /></a> </p>  <p>Unfortunately this visualization of our progress is regularly being interrupted by tourist videos advertising regional attractions (although not location-based, which would actually have been quite neat), but then as so much of our trip is being spent without GPS reception inside tunnels beneath the Alps I suppose they had to put something on the screens.</p>  <p></p>  <p>Alright, that’s it, for now… back online at the end of the week. Ciao!</p>
