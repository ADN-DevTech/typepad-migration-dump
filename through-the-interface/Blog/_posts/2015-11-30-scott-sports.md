<p>A few weeks ago a colleague – and keen mountain biker – from the Neuchatel office, Nicolas Barras, pointed me at a video created by one of his favourite local brands, SCOTT Sports, showing their goggle manufacturing process. Nicolas – a huge SCOTT fan – was curious about their use of design software.</p>  <p style="text-align: center">&#0160;</p>  <p style="text-align: center"><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0faitA16IBM?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" width="560"></iframe></p>  <p style="text-align: center">&#0160;</p>  <p>Watching the video with Nicolas, I could see Autodesk Inventor being used for their tooling design at around the 43s mark. This made me curious, too: I wondered whether it was also used to design the goggles, themselves. SCOTT is located at Givisiez, near Fribourg (it’s about 45km from the Autodesk office in Neuchatel), so I decided to get in touch with SCOTT to find out more.</p>  <p>Ryan Bloodworth is the Lead 3D Digital Designer at SCOTT in Givisiez and was kind enough to get on the phone to tell me about SCOTT Sports. He explained a bit about SCOTT’s history in Switzerland, as well as providing some information about their use of design software.</p>  <p>I have a strong mental association between SCOTT and the United States; after all, the label SCOTT USA is still commonly found on mountain bikes and ski equipment. It turns out the company is now Swiss owned, having been through a series of management buy-outs over the last couple of decades. You can find out more from <a href="https://www.scott-sports.com/global/en/company/history/" target="_blank">the company’s history page</a>.</p>  <p>SCOTT has a few hundred employees at their Givisiez site: Ryan explained that their production happens elsewhere, however. In terms of the design work – for goggles, helmets and protection – SCOTT uses Autodesk Alias exclusively for all design and sketch modelling through to A surface (and sometimes B) production modelling. Designs are then handed over to engineering for their work in Pro-Engineer, however they never modify the base surfaces.</p>  <p>On the production side of things, it’s clear they’re using Autodesk Inventor, at least for mold design for their goggles.</p>  <p>SCOTT kindly provided some images of their goggle production process, which I’ve included below. I assume the shots were taken at their factory in Austria, as if you look closely they’re using German-language Inventor. :-)</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201bb0895bfc4970d-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="Using Inventor for goggle frame tooling" border="0" height="335" src="/assets/image_401272.jpg" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 50px auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" title="Using Inventor for goggle frame tooling" width="504" /></a></p>  <p>Goggle frames are injection molded:</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b8d17b5bb5970c-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="The mold for this model of goggles" border="0" height="335" src="/assets/image_297519.jpg" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 50px auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" title="The mold for this model of goggles" width="504" /></a></p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201bb0895bfc8970d-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="A box of molds" border="0" height="335" src="/assets/image_180672.jpg" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 50px auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" title="A box of molds" width="504" /></a></p>  <p>Once molded, goggle frames sometimes have patterns applied.
