<p>A number of colleagues from Autodesk Research have participated (as have I) in an activity to help people learn more about our organization, who we are are and what we do.</p>
<p>Here’s the video about me:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&#0160;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="283" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qRFy2BQHJ84?si=H610onV8Q2XZIaiF" title="YouTube video player" width="500"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&#0160;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It’s part of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5DhpoI3HKE-tt2C63xgoU9waHpYEkdzw">a playlist</a> on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@autodeskresearch">Autodesk Research YouTube channel</a>, so you can hopefully see the others once mine has played (or just skip mine to watch the others :-).</p>
<p>If you’re interested in getting to know more about our work, then I also recommend visiting the <a href="https://www.research.autodesk.com/blog">Autodesk Research blog</a>.</p>

The main Autodesk blog also has research-centric content, such as <a href="https://blogs.autodesk.com/autodesk-life/inside-autodesk/artificial-intelligence/">this recent post</a> talking with some colleagues who are working with AI (including Dagmara Szkurlat, with whom I work very closely).</p>
<p>If you have thoughts on what you’d like to hear from Autodesk Research, please do let me know. I’d be happy to pass the information on to our communications team (assuming I can’t just tell you what you want to hear myself ;-).</p>
