<p>It’s been an interesting year, so far, at many levels, and I have no major expectation that it’s going to become less so in its remaining months.</p>
<p>For starters there’s the weather. As someone who is walking a dog for an hour a day, I feel intimately in tune with the weather, these days. And it has sucked. Badly. Even nature seems to be rebelling at the amount of rain, which is in itself remarkable.</p>
<p>We’re about to head off to visit friends in Brittany and family in the UK, which means it may well get worse before it gets better. We shall see.</p>
<p>At work things are moving forwards: our research is progressing but also broadening in scope, which is exciting for the team. More will be shared on this in due course.</p>
<p>This week I <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7214184001337462784/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announced over on LinkedIn</a> that I’ve been promoted to Director, which is as much as anything a validation of the research my team is delivering. I’ve received lots of kind words about this news - along with requests for a blog post describing the change - so thank you all for that. My role isn’t actually changing - at least not right now - as this is more a recognition of the importance of the role I’m currently in. All of which is fantastic, of course.</p>
<p>Once we’re back from our trip, I’ll be looking forward to the rest of the year: in August I’ll be heading across to Baltimore to get our eldest son settled into his exchange year at Johns Hopkins University, and beyond that I’m expecting to be back in Toronto for a team meeting in mid-September, in San Diego for AU 2024 in mid-October, and then back somewhere on the west coast again for an offsite in November. And we’re coming across as a family to be with our son over the holidays. I hope my body adjusts OK to long-term melatonin usage!</p>
<p>Last night I had the chance to catch up with a whole bunch of current and ex-Autodesk folks, some of whom will be recognizable to many of you.</p>

<p>I’ll try to post some photos from the road, as I’ll be seeing a few more familiar faces in Brittany and beyond!</p>
