<p>I’ve been involved at some level in Autodesk’s annual Developer Days tours for as long as they’ve been happening (at least in a coordinated, worldwide fashion), although for the last few years it’s been purely as an attendee (and last year only in Las Vegas). This is the first year I can remember the event being publicised more broadly than to our existing ADN members: many non-ADN (or ADN Open) members may not realise that this tour is a benefit available to Standard and Professional members, so we’re helping spread the word.</p>  <p>DevDays is a great way to get a sense of what technology is coming from Autodesk, something that’s valuable even for Autodesk employees: the ADN team does a great job of synthesising what’s coming from our various product groups – a challenging task for lots of reasons (the timing of the event relative to development schedules, the volume of information to summarise and present within a limited amount of time, the difficulty of creating demo apps on pre-Alpha software, etc.).</p>  <p>Here’s some information on this year’s tour from the ADN team – I’ll carry on writing below it, in case.</p>  <hr />  <p><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; float: right; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="rEvolution" border="0" hspace="12" alt="rEvolution" align="right" src="/assets/image_763853.jpg" width="196" height="196" /><b><i><font size="3">rEvolution</font></i></b></p>  <p><em><strong>Where Desktop meets the Cloud</strong></em></p>  <p><em>Got great ideas for cloud and mobile apps? Want to learn where Autodesk is taking the convergence of desktop computing and cloud technology?</em></p>  <p><em>If you’re an innovator developing on Autodesk platform technology and have not yet attended an Autodesk Developer Network Conference join us for a deep dive as we take an in-depth look at Autodesk’s newest technologies and the next generation of products coming in 2014. The Autodesk Developer Network is holding its annual, worldwide Developer Day Conference and DevLab in cities around the world from November 2013 through February 2014.</em></p>  <p><em>Called Autodesk DevDays 2013, the theme for this year’s event is rEvolution – Where Desktop meets the Cloud.&#160; Come and learn about upcoming releases of several new web service APIs from Autodesk.&#160; You’ll see how these new web services extend the power of the desktop: delivering easy collaboration, limitless compute power and big data – and are platforms that can deliver the same to you and your customers.&#160; It’s an opportunity to learn about a range of “360 based” web service APIs delivering you Cloud based platforms for a number of industries - Manufacturing, AEC, Infrastructure and more. And, we will of course also cover what’s new in the next releases of our desktop products (AutoCAD®, Autodesk® Revit®, Autodesk® Inventor®, AutoCAD® Civil 3D® and so on)!</em></p>  <p><em>Note that material at Developer Days is forward-looking and highly confidential so ADN membership is required.
