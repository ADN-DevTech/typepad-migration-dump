<p>I saw an announcement for <a href="http://www.talenthouse.com/design-visualization-for-autodesk-morgan-motor-company-hp-nvidia" target="_blank">this competition</a> back at Autodesk University 2013, but haven’t yet posted about it on this blog. The competition is now in its final stages – the deadline is on <strong>March 26, 2014</strong> at 10am PST – but that means exactly 9 days left to enter from the time this post goes live.</p>
<p>The concept is simple: you have to use one of three Autodesk products – Inventor, Showcase or 3ds Max – to create a rendering of the <a href="http://www.morgan3wheeler.co.uk" target="_blank">Morgan 3 Wheeler</a> to be published as an advertisement in <a href="http://www.mogmag.co.uk" target="_blank">MOG Magazine</a>.</p>
<p>Aside from installing one or more of these products – and they’re all available as part of the <a href="http://www.autodesk.com/suites/product-design-suite/free-trial" target="_blank">Autodesk Product Design Suite trial</a>, in case – you will need to download the appropriate model(s) of the Morgan 3 Wheeler from <a href="http://www.talenthouse.com/design-visualization-for-autodesk-morgan-motor-company-hp-nvidia#download-files-anchor" target="_blank">the competition page</a>. The good news is that they&#39;ve provided decent models for each of the 3 products, so you won’t have to resort to <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2013/06/comparing-123d-catch-with-recap-photo.html" target="_blank">using ReCap Photo</a>, like I did. ;-)</p>
<p>Here’s a quick walkthrough video to get you started:</p>

<p>I’d love to have a crack at this, but a) I’m not eligible as I work for one of the sponsors and b) it wouldn’t be fair as I have <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2014/03/autodesk-and-morgan-at-the-geneva-motor-show.html" target="_blank">some awesome tech</a> <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2014/03/configuring-3-wheelers-at-the-geneva-motor-show.html" target="_blank">at my disposal</a>. I’d be very happy to hear that one of this blog’s readers managed to win, though – I suppose I’d have competed vicariously, at least.</p>
