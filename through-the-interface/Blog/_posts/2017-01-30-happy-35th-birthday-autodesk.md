<p>Autodesk turned 35 years old, today. To commemorate this event, <a href="http://autodesk.blogs.com/between_the_lines/2017/01/autodesk-35th-next-monday-wear-your-oldest-autodesk-shirt.html" target="_blank">Shaan has suggested we all wear our oldest Autodesk shirt</a>. I know I have an R14 ARX T-shirt somewhere, but I can’t seem to find it (it was always about 5 sizes too big, so it may well have been thrown out).</p> <p>The best I could do were these two polo shirts from circa 2000. I’m not sure which is oldest, so here they both are. I’d joined the company five years before that, in 1995, but was based in Europe: a notoriously merchandising-starved continent, back then. It wasn’t until I moved to the Bay Area in 2000 that my ’deskdrobe started filling out. :-)</p> <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b8d25a4c43970c-pi" target="_blank"><img title="First classic polo" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 30px auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="First classic polo" src="/assets/image_52805.jpg" width="265" height="281"></a><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b8d25a4c51970c-pi" target="_blank"><img title="Second classic polo" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 30px auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="Second classic polo" src="/assets/image_463018.jpg" width="261" height="281"></a></p> <p>Anyway, here’s to 35 years of the ’desk. I’m proud to have been part of the journey for a good chunk of that. Let’s see what the coming years bring!</p>
