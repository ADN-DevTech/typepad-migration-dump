<p><a href="https://youtu.be/w9GmefYuILI" rel="noopener" target="_blank">This week’s Floppy Friday</a> is once again floppiless, as we take a new old <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_2600" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Atari CX 2600 A</a> – with its gorgeous wood panelling – for a spin:</p>

<p>We focus on space-themed video games – which were apparently a favourite for early video game designers, as the emptiness of space lent itself to more limited hardware platforms – looking at Space Invaders, Asteroids, Phoenix and Defender. (In case people are interested, we looked at Space Invaders and Asteroids on the C6 in <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2021/01/floppy-friday-14.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Floppy Friday #14</a> and we saw some games on the Atari 2600 Jr in <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2021/03/floppy-friday-20.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Floppy Friday #20</a>.)</p>
<p>Here’s this week’s video:</p>

<p>I tracked down some information about the extra “joy-stick” that came with the console.</p>
<p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202788023686e200d-pi" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="LY-010B joy-stick" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_880097.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="LY-010B joy-stick" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>While I couldn’t find out who made it, the joy-stick did come with some handy (albeit in places quite bizarre) instructions.</p>

<p><em>“Pls don’t work to hard when you play on stick. That can keep more longer for you stick life.”</em> Words to live by!</p>
<p>Before we wrap up, here’s a fantastic history lesson on <a href="https://youtu.be/F_kEhHAMupU" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Rise &amp; Fall of Atari</a> – and how the company was connected to both Steve Jobs and Bill Gates – that’s well worth a watch. Many thanks for Fernando Malard for sharing this gem.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">It’s very interesting to see the information about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pac-Man_(Atari_2600)" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Pac-Man</a>: I was tempted to include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ms._Pac-Man" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Ms. Pac-Man</a> in this week’s episode, before I settled on the “Space” theme, but I haven’t yet played the infamous Pac-Man port (I don’t have the Pac-Man cartridge, only Ms. Pac-Man). It was fascinating to learn about its background!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">That’s it for this week. We’ll see whether we stick with cartridges or switch back to floppies for next week.</p>
