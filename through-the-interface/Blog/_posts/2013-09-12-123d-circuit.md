<p>This one came as a (very nice) surprise: Autodesk has collaborated with <a href="http://www.circuits.io" target="_blank">Circuits.io</a> to provide a new tool called <a href="http://123d.circuits.io" target="_blank">123D Circuits</a>. Here’s <a href="http://blog.123dapp.com/2013/09/introducing-123d-circuits" target="_blank">the announcement</a> along with <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/09/10/autodesk-releases-an-electronics-simulator-called-123d-circuits/" target="_blank">some</a> <a href="http://hackaday.com/2013/09/11/123d-circuits-autodesks-free-design-tool/" target="_blank">media</a> <a href="http://lifehacker.com/123d-circuits-is-a-free-collaborative-electronics-desi-1293193343" target="_blank">coverage</a>.</p>
<p>123D Circuits is a handy, web-based tool that allows you to create, share and collaborate on circuit designs such as those you&#39;d use with an Arduino microcontroller. And if you’re using an Arduino in your circuit, you can even code inside the embedded IDE and simulate its behaviour directly inside your browser – with almost no risk of blowing it up!</p>
<p>You can also embed these circuits into web-pages, which is clearly sweet music to bloggers&#39; ears. ;-)</p>
<p>For instance, here&#39;s a quick circuit I threw together based on <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2013/01/blinking-lights-and-other-revelations.html" target="_blank">the first Arduino project I talked about on this blog</a>, albeit with minor adjustments to the resistance applied to the LEDs (basically to make the results more visible during simulation):</p>

<p>Pretty cool stuff (not the circuit itself – the ability to create it online and embed it in an HTML page :-). Be sure to head on over and have a play.</p>
