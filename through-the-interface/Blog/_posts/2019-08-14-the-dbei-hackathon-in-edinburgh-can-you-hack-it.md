<p>The <a href="https://www.dbeinstitute.org" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Digital Built Environment Institute (DBEI)</a> has posted <a href="https://www.dbeinstitute.org/news/europe-can-you-hack-it/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">an announcement</a> about the Hackathon preceding BILT Europe. The Hackathon will be a one-day event in Edinburgh on <strong>October 9th, 2019</strong>, just before the main conference on October 10th-12th. This will be my first BILT: I&#39;ll be there to help out with a class about Refinery and so I&#39;ll absolutely be present at the Hackathon, too.<a class="asset-img-link" href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4764d41200c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false"><img alt="DBEI Hackathon" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83452464869e20240a4764d41200c img-responsive" src="/assets/image_529346.jpg" style="width: 500px; display: block; margin-top: 30px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="DBEI Hackathon" /></a></p>

<p>The theme of the Hackathon is &quot;Generative Design in Practice&quot;: it&#39;s going to be very interesting to see what the teams are able to put together and communicate (in a highly streamlined manner, given the short timeframe) in a one-day event. One way or another it should be a lot of fun. If you&#39;re interested in joining, <a href="https://www.dbeinstitute.org/event/dbei-hackathon-europe-2019/pricing" rel="noopener" target="_blank">go ahead and register now</a>.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll be arriving in Edinburgh early on October 8th, arriving with my family - our first time in Edinburgh! - on an overnight train leaving from Euston on the night of the 7th. While in London we&#39;ll be visiting the Harry Potter Studios, and then travelling up overnight in cabins on the <a href="https://www.sleeper.scot/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Caledonian Sleeper</a> (which somehow also feels well within the theme, even if the Hogwarts Express leaves from King&#39;s Cross and doesn&#39;t have sleeper carriages). We&#39;ll be staying on in Scotland for the best part of 2 weeks, which means I&#39;ll be skipping AU Germany and the accompanying Forge DevCon, this year. I&#39;m very much looking forward to this trip, though.</p>
