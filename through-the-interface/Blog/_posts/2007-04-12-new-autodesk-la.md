<p>Scott Sheppard - the original author of the very informative DWF blog, <a href="http://dwf.blogs.com">Beyond the Paper</a> - has launched a new blog talking about <a href="http://labs.autodesk.com">Autodesk Labs</a>, called <a href="http://labs.blogs.com">It's Alive in the Lab</a>.</p>

<p>I'm looking forward to seeing lots of cool information on Labs technology coming through this blog.</p>
