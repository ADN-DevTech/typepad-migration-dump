<p>As John Walker once said, <a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/autofile/e5/chapter2_94.html" target="_blank">many years ago</a>, Autodesk does not change CEO very often: during the first decade of the company’s history, only two people had the role. Like a lot of things John said back then, it turned out to be impressively predictive of the future: during the following 25 years we had just two more!</p><p>Here’s the list:</p><ul><li>John Walker, 1982-1986</li><li>Al Green, 1986-1992</li><li>Carol Bartz, 1992-2006</li><li>Carl Bass, 2006-2017</li><li>Andrew Anagnost, 2017-…</li></ul><p>As you can see from the last item, the search for our new CEO has ended: after some months during which Andrew and Amar Hanspal shared the CEO role – along with continuing their other, respective responsibilities – <a href="http://blogs.autodesk.com/inthefold/next-chapter-letter-andrew-anagnost/" target="_blank">the board selected Andrew to lead the company</a>, moving forward.<a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201bb09a738f8970d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="400" height="601" title="Andrew Anagnost" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Andrew Anagnost" src="/assets/image_279768.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Here’s a video message from Andrew:</p><p align="center"><br></p><p align="center"><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-XNR5BxNMd0?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0?ecver=1" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p align="center"><br></p><p><br></p><p>Included in <a href="http://news.autodesk.com/2017-06-19-Autodesk-Names-Andrew-Anagnost-President-and-CEO" target="_blank">the announcement of Andrew’s promotion</a> was the sad news that Amar has decided to leave the company. Losing both Carl and Amar is a really tough pill to swallow: both have played such a strong role in the company over the last 30 years that it’s hard to imagine Autodesk without either of them.</p><p>But Andrew brings a lot to his new role: while in recent years he’s been focused on running the company’s Business Strategy and Marketing organisation – including driving the company’s ongoing business model transformation – he has deep technical chops, too. Andrew once worked as an engineer at NASA and played a key role in bringing Autodesk Inventor to market, way back when. So we’re in good hands.</p><p>Any change can be disruptive – especially a change that happens just five times in 35 years – but this certainly marks the beginning of a new era at Autodesk. Congratulations on the new role, <a href="https://twitter.com/andrew_anagnost" target="_blank">Andrew</a>, and a fond farewell to <a href="https://twitter.com/carlbass" target="_blank">Carl</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/amarhanspal" target="_blank">Amar</a>. You’ll both be missed!</p>
