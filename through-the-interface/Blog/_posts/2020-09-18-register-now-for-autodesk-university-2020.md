<p>It’s been a crazy year, but there’s comfort to be had in certain things going ahead despite the craziness. For me Autodesk University is one of these things: my first AU was back in the year 2000, and I’ve probably only missed a few in the last two decades.</p><p>This year’s AU experience will be 100% virtual but also 100% free, so I’m really excited that so many more people will be able to experience AU!</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2026bde93cb26200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="340" height="500" title="AU mainstage" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="AU mainstage" src="/assets/image_491799.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>As of Wednesday, <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/autodesk-university/blog/AU-2020-Registration-Open-2020" target="_blank">registration is now open for this year’s AU</a>. It’s quick and easy – no need to fill out credit card details for the fee or the hotel reservation! – so there’s really no reason not to <a href="https://autodeskuniversity.smarteventscloud.com/portal/contactInfo.ww" target="_blank">go ahead and register today</a>.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2026bde93cb31200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="281" title="AU 2020 registration is open" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="AU 2020 registration is open" src="/assets/image_488949.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>If you still somehow need convincing of the value of signing up, <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/autodesk-university/conference/schedule" target="_blank">head on over to check out this year’s class list</a>. I’m really excited about the class I’m delivering – this year’s is focused very much on the work we’ve been doing recently on Project Dasher but will also include a bit of a “reveal”, which should be of interest to a lot of people.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2026bde93cb35200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="357" height="500" title="More mainstage" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="More mainstage" src="/assets/image_297477.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>There is, of course, lots I’ll miss about a physical AU. But if we can somehow capture the best of the AU experience without having to deal with the travel, the jetlag and the intense fatigue, I’m all in. I have a lot of faith in our events team, but we’ll find out soon enough how it’s all going to work. One of the “features” that I’m somewhat involved in is the Forge Hackathon, which I’m expecting to be a lot of fun. Watch this space for more information on that.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2026bde93cb39200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="259" title="Reimagine Possible" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Reimagine Possible" src="/assets/image_940803.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>In the meantime, I have to prepare my slides and my handout and then record the session, all of which needs to happen in the next month. Looking forward to seeing you all online for AU2020!</p>
