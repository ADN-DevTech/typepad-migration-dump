You will be able to join the join the session via&nbsp; <a href="https://live-macad.iaac.net" target="_blank">the IaaC MaCAD Facebook page</a>.</p><p>These presentations are the result of a studio on Artificial Intelligence in Architecture, with a particular focus on AI For Urban Resilience. During the studio, led by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/angeloschronis/" target="_blank">Angelos Chronis</a> and assisted by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/aleksandra-jastrzebska/" target="_blank">Aleksandra Jastrzębska</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nariddh/" target="_blank">Nariddh Khean</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/serjoscha-d%C3%BCring-920644173/" target="_blank">Serjoscha Düring</a>, the students developed AI-driven urban solutions for the city of Vienna, based on openly available data of the city.</p><p>I’ve already seen the majority of these projects during a midway check-in session, and I’m very much looking forward to seeing how they’ve progressed since. I hope to see you there!</p>
