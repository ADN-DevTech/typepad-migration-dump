<p>If you’ve visited <a href="https://intandem.autodesk.com/" target="_blank">the Tandem website</a>, this week, you may have seen a little footer saying “<strong><em>Unleash the power of digital twins with Tandem APIs | Now in Beta</em></strong>”.</p><p>This is interesting news for the many (100+, at the last count) developers using Forge to build digital twins. Those using Revit or IFC as a data-source will most probably find the possibility of building on Tandem to be of significant interest.</p><p>If you click on the <a href="https://intandem.autodesk.com/developing-for-tandem/" target="_blank">“Learn more about APIs” link</a> to the right of the footer, you’ll end up on a page that describes the API and SDK available for Tandem and points you at <a href="https://autodesk-tandem.github.io/" target="_blank">further resources</a>.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202942fae014f200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="353" title="Tandem API landing page" style="margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; float: none; display: block;" alt="Tandem API landing page" src="/assets/image_666503.jpg"></a></p><p>One that’s of particular interest to “hands-on” developers is the <a href="https://autodesk-tandem.github.io/tandem-sample-emb-viewer/#" target="_blank">Tandem SDK test bed</a>, an interactive environment that allows you to see what’s possible with the current API – using your own facilities.</p><p>I tried the test bed quickly with the NEST facility – this is the one that loaded by default for me when I logged in.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2027880804911200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="353" title="NEST in the Tandem SDK test bed" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="NEST in the Tandem SDK test bed" src="/assets/image_42967.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p align="left">I won’t dig into the capabilities of the SDK today – many of which we’ve used in our Tandem-based version of <a href="https://dasher360.com" target="_blank">Dasher</a>, of course – as this post is more a quick “heads-up” for people that want to go and have a play for themselves. We will talk more about the Tandem API and SDK in due course, for sure.</p><p>Have fun!</p>
