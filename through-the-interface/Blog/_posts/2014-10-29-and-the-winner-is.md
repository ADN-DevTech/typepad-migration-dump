I had a lot of fun seeing the responses roll in!</p>  <p>I didn’t actually expect anyone to get the “right” answer – as <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2014/10/autocad-io-api-a-new-batch-processing-web-service.html" target="_blank">the service the dashboard is monitoring</a> hadn’t been announced publicly, at the time – but I was impressed by the Autodesk employees who used their knowledge to try and get a free t-shirt – that’s the kind of initiative that helped build this company into what it is today ;-). With 20-20 hindsight I probably should have specifically excluded Autodeskers from participating. I’ll try to remember that for next time.</p>  <p>I had a hard time choosing the winning entry… it was pretty clear it was going to be based on humour rather than reality, and there were a few really good ones. In the end I chose <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2014/10/a-dashboard-but-what-for.html#comment-1649560563" target="_blank">the entry by Alex Stenz</a> – partly because I’m a huge fan of Douglas Adams and it’s been 30 years since the Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy was published. (For those Douglas Adams fans who haven’t seen it, you might want to try <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/1g84m0sXpnNCv84GpN2PLZG/the-hitchhikers-guide-to-the-galaxy-game-30th-anniversary-edition" target="_blank">the BBC’s 30th anniversary HGttG game</a>. I do love a good text adventure.) There’s also something oddly compelling about the idea of using AutoCAD I/O to calculate the meaning of life, the universe and everything.</p>  <p>On the topic of possible uses for AutoCAD I/O, do start thinking about what you might use the service for. I was part of an internal brainstorming session with members of the AutoCAD I/O team, last week, and there were a number of great suggestions for potential services (whether developed internally and shared via a global Activity library or developed externally). I think it’d be great to extend this discussion to a virtual brainstorm via a blog post. But that’s for another day – I want to present some possibilities in the post itself, to get the discussion started.</p>  <p>Congratulations, Alex – I’ll get in touch by email to see whether one of the t-shirt sizes I have will work for you. :-)</p>  <p><font color="#a5a5a5">photo credit: </font><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/garryknight/4876209724/"><font color="#a5a5a5">garryknight</font></a><font color="#a5a5a5"> via </font><a href="http://photopin.com"><font color="#a5a5a5">photopin</font></a><font color="#a5a5a5"> </font><a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/"><font color="#a5a5a5">cc</font></a></p>
