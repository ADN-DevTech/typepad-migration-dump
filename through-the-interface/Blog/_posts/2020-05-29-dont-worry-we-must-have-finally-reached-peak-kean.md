<p>I have the sense that I’m seeing my face too much at the moment (admittedly I’m very attached to it… haha). All I can say, in my defence, is that over the last few weeks I’ve started to receive more requests to participate in virtual activities. And I’ve mostly said yes, as it’s a reasonable alternative to travelling to meet people, given the current circumstances we’re all in.</p>
<p>In case you haven’t seen these various pieces of virtual content – and you’re actually interested – here’s a quick round-up of some current and future ones.</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">Getting Simple</span></h3>
<p>When my friend Nono Martínez Alonso asked me to participate in his Getting Simple podcast, I jumped at the chance: he has recorded some amazing episodes with people I admire greatly, and so I considered it a privilege to participate in it. Nono generally likes to do these in-person, but we did some tests and found a way to make it work remotely. Here’s an animation of us in action – we used Zoom to coordinate the discussion, but each recorded locally.</p>

<p>Here’s <a href="https://gettingsimple.com/kean-walmsley" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the podcast itself</a>:</p>

<p>It’s quite a long one – at 1 hour and 40 minutes you could spend the time watching a movie, instead – but when I listened through (I had to do a “proof listen”, as it were) I actually managed! I <strong>hate</strong> listening to my own voice, so I can only assume that Nono somehow worked some magic during the editing that made it tolerable.</p>
<p>If you’re interested in understanding more about Nono’s editing process – and I know he puts a huge amount of effort into this side of things – you can check his recently recorded livestream:</p>

<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">LinkedIn Live with Alejandro Mata</span></h3>
<p>Alejandro Mata has been using LinkedIn Live to record interviews with people from our industry. I was also very happy when Alejandro invited me to have a chat about Generative Design and Digital Twins.</p>
<p>I’m not sure how to embed LinkedIn Live content – if it’s even possible – so <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/video/live/urn:li:ugcPost:6672028902493442048/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here’s a link to the video from this morning</a>.</p>

<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">CanBIM</span></h3>
<p>The voice of Canada’s building and infrastructure community – the brilliantly named CanBIM – have invited me to participate in an event on June 16th entitled “<a href="https://www.canbim.com/events/calgary20" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Future of Work: Designing Resiliency and Building Safety Post-COVID</a>”. As I’m dialling in from Europe they kindly put me at the front of the schedule with a talk on “<a href="https://www.canbim.com/agenda/using-generative-design-and-digital-twins-to-improve-occupant-well-being" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Using Generative Design and Digital Twins to Improve Occupant Well Being</a>”.</p>
<p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20263e94c765e200b-pi" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="CanBIM event" border="0" height="266" src="/assets/image_806782.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="CanBIM event" width="504" /></a></p>
<p>The overall agenda looks really interesting, and the event is open to non-members to join, too (at a slightly higher fee, logically enough).</p>

<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">Archgyan</span></h3>
<p>Back at the beginning of the current pandemic crisis, Manish Paul Simon interviewed me for his Archgyan podcast. This is still a work in progress – Manish has understandably had other concerns over the last few months – but it should should be published sometime in the coming weeks to the <a href="http://archgyan.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Archgyan</a> site.</p>
<p>Anyway – I do apologise if you feel as though I’m spamming you both audibly and visually, at the moment: I do think it’s just a strange convergence that’s due to the unique nature of this period or just outright coincidence, so things should settle back down in the weeks to come.</p>
