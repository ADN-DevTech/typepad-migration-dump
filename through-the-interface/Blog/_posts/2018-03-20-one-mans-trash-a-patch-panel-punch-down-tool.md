<p>As we continue clearing out cupboards and desks in the Neuchatel office, another potential treasure was uncovered by Francesco Tonioni. It seemed like a very interesting – and probably very useful – tool.<p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b7c959d8e4970b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="375" height="500" title="Patch Panel Punch Down Tool" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Patch Panel Punch Down Tool" src="/assets/image_356076.jpg" border="0"></a><p>We weren’t at all sure what it was until Hashim Mundol recognised it from a previous life. He identified it correctly as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punch_down_tool" target="_blank">patch panel punch down tool</a> that’s apparently used by network technicians to wire network cables into patch panels.<p>I have no idea if it’s something a reader of this blog might find useful. If so, <a href="mailto:kean.walmsley@autodesk.com" target="_blank">drop me a mail</a> with your name and address and I’ll ship it off to you!
