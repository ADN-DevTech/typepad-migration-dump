<p>I’m on the train home after a whirlwind week in Las Vegas. Another great AU is “in the bag” and I’m looking forward to getting home to my family. But first a quick recap of the week…</p><p>I arrived on Saturday night, as usual, and managed to get a decent first night’s sleep. On Sunday I did a few things… I checked out the rooms I’d be presenting in during the week, which is always slightly surreal.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad37ab109200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="The classrooms are ready for business" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="The classrooms are ready for business" src="/assets/image_842842.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>I wandered along the strip: they’d closed it off for the Rock N Roll Marathon, which apparently caused incredible havoc for those arriving on Sunday.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad37ab10f200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="The strip was closed for business" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="The strip was closed for business" src="/assets/image_105921.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>As usual I ended up shopping a little at the Fashion Show Mall.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad37ab117200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="375" height="500" title="Fashion Show Mall" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Fashion Show Mall" src="/assets/image_756707.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>And then saw some runners finishing the Marathon.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad37ab11b200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Runners at the end of the Rock N Roll Marathon" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Runners at the end of the Rock N Roll Marathon" src="/assets/image_268798.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>After dinner with the Forge team – and another night’s sleep under the belt – it was time for the pre-conference events to kick-off. I managed to attend the mainstage for Connect &amp; Construct:</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad37ab11f200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Construct and Connect keynote" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Construct and Connect keynote" src="/assets/image_129144.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>I popped by the Forge Village, where I was delighted to see my colleague, Simon Breslav, sitting on the wall.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad37ab123200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Simon hanging out in the Forge Village" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Simon hanging out in the Forge Village" src="/assets/image_168591.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>My first session of the week was co-presenting with Lorenzo Villaggi, talking about the Van Wijnen project.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad3c0796e200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="261" title="The empty room" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="The empty room" src="/assets/image_805579.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>It was a genuine honour to be presenting with a colleague from The Living: they’re doing such cool stuff.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad3c07972200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="431" title="Kean and Lorenzo" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Kean and Lorenzo" src="/assets/image_189745.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>The aim of this class was to talk about the tool we created for Van Wijnen that was featured on last year’s AU mainstage.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad3a0d8aa200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="375" height="500" title="Introduction" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Introduction" src="/assets/image_291809.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Despite the fact the session was scheduled at the same time as the Forge DevCon keynote (it was part of Connect &amp; Construct), it was well-attended with standing-room only.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad3a0d8b2200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="A good crowd for our first class" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="A good crowd for our first class" src="/assets/image_52476.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>After this 90-minute session I had a short break before presenting my own 60-minute session on “Skeletons, Robots and Streamlines” as part of the Forge DevCon.</p><p>Once this was completed I was happy to kick back over a drink and chat with old friends (such as Simon Yorke) at the welcome reception.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad3c07976200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Kean and Simon" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Kean and Simon" src="/assets/image_244962.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Sometime after that I ended up at an internal mixer for the MCP (Manufacturing, Construction and Production) team.<br></p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad37ab133200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Evening event for the MCP team" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Evening event for the MCP team" src="/assets/image_432992.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Yes, I suppose I was (strictly speaking) gatecrashing, but for me it was a great chance to catch up with my old Neuchatel colleague (who moved to SF when the office closed), Emanuele Dias.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad37ab137200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Kean and Emanuele" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Kean and Emanuele" src="/assets/image_614510.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>On Tuesday the day started with the AU mainstage sandwiched between a few customer meetings on various topics. Andrew Anagnost kicked things off:</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad37ab140200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Andrew on the AU mainstage" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Andrew on the AU mainstage" src="/assets/image_741563.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>It was nice to see our CTO, Scott Borduin, taking the stage once again:</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad3a0d8c6200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Scott on the AU mainstage" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Scott on the AU mainstage" src="/assets/image_555787.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Erin Bradner, who heads up our AI and Robotics Lab in Pier 9, talked to us about a generative design colleaboration with NASA’s JPL:</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad3c0797a200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Erin talks generative" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Erin talks generative" src="/assets/image_954962.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>After this it was time for my second solo class, this time talking about Getting Started with AEC (i.e. Project Refinery). Another good turn-out!</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad37ab148200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="The crown for my Getting Started with Generative Design for AEC class" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="The crown for my Getting Started with Generative Design for AEC class" src="/assets/image_425833.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>I didn’t get time to try them myself, but it was fun to see the various VR exhibits attracting long queues.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad3a0d8d1200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Another VR experience" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Another VR experience" src="/assets/image_908274.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>I had a fun discussion with some old friends: Denis, Oleg and I debated the relative merits and inconveniences of remote working.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad3a0d8d9200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Kean, Denis and Oleg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Kean, Denis and Oleg" src="/assets/image_146804.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>The generatively designed lander that Erin had showcased was also on display in the Exhibit Hall.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad37ab152200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="The generatively design Mars lander" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="The generatively design Mars lander" src="/assets/image_174927.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>My Wednesday – the one day I didn’t have any sessions to present – ended up filling up with customer briefings. I did find time to pop by the AEC mainstage event, though.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad3a0d8dd200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="79" title="AEC mainstage" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="AEC mainstage" src="/assets/image_759711.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>I also killed a spare half-hour in the Exhibit Hall, catching up with more old friends. Here’s a picture with the one-and-only Rob Oud, someone I’ve now known for 23 years.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad37ab158200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Kean and Rob" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Kean and Rob" src="/assets/image_337163.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>It was also great to see my friends at CCTech, chatting about a number of cool tech topics.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad3c07988200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Kean, Sandip and Nem" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Kean, Sandip and Nem" src="/assets/image_757238.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Later on Lorenzo and I stopped by a suite in the Palazzo for an interview with Jacqueline Rohrmann, also known as That BIM Girl. You’ll hopefully see that show up soon on YouTube.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad3a0d8e9200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="No escaping the orange one" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="No escaping the orange one" src="/assets/image_483732.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Wednesday evening was the last one in Vegas for many attendees, myself included. For me this started with a “robotics happy hour”, followed by the OCTO mixer where Shaan, Scott and I chewed the fat and compared blogging notes.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad37ab163200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="OCTO bloggers" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="OCTO bloggers" src="/assets/image_248428.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>The main AU party was once again (the last time being 2 years ago) at The LINQ.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad3a0d9c8200d-pi"><img width="375" height="500" title="Nice specs" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Nice specs" src="/assets/image_562596.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>I ended up hanging out with Hali Larsen (who is the other main person working on Dasher besides Simon Breslav and myself) and our colleagues from The Living, Lorenzo, Danil Nagy and Ray Wang. Here we are just about to go on the big wheel.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad37ab16e200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Kean, Hali, Lorenzo, Danil and Ray" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Kean, Hali, Lorenzo, Danil and Ray" src="/assets/image_965189.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>By the time we came down the party had finished, so we headed on over to DynaNoche. Here’s a shot with Lorenzo and Jaqueline.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad37ab176200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Kean, Lorenzo and That BIM Girl (Jacqueline)" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Kean, Lorenzo and That BIM Girl (Jacqueline)" src="/assets/image_820843.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Dieter Vermeulen took a turn on the decks, at one point.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad3a0d8ed200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="375" height="500" title="Dieter on the decks" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Dieter on the decks" src="/assets/image_727097.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>After a late finish, I got up, packed and checked out before heading to Reto Largo and Thomas Mueller’s sesion on NEST. It was nice to see them feature (and demo!) the integration with Dasher 360.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad3c079a3200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Reto and Thomas talking NEST and Dasher" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Reto and Thomas talking NEST and Dasher" src="/assets/image_869690.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>I popped back, once again, via the AU Exhibit Hall. Here’s a snap of some innovating flooring that has been developed at ETH Zurich by tge Block Research Group that significantly reduces the amount of concrete needed in flooring.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad3a0d8f1200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="BRG flooring used in NEST" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="BRG flooring used in NEST" src="/assets/image_906323.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Lorenzo and I took our luggage with us for our last session at AU, a repeat of Monday’s session about the Van Wijnen project (this time squeezed into 60 minutes).</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad3a0d8f6200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Last session of the week" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Last session of the week" src="/assets/image_8580.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Once again it was very well attended – it’s clearly an interesting topic for people.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad3a0d8fa200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Another packed room" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Another packed room" src="/assets/image_115635.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>We headed straight to the airport afterwards, as we both had 5pm flights: Lorenzo’s to New York and mine to Zurich via Frankfurt. It was interesting flying with Condor Airlines: as an airline catering to holidaymakers they had some slightly strange concepts, such as charging for use of the entertainment system. Luckily I really needed to sleep, and did so for most of the way back.</p><p>I had a window seat on the connecting leg to Switzerland, and it was actually very nice to be able to look out of the window, for once.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad3c079a9200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Nice arriving home" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Nice arriving home" src="/assets/image_238436.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad3c079ad200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="375" height="500" title="Landing in Switzerland" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Landing in Switzerland" src="/assets/image_195143.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>As usual it was a fantastic week at Autodesk University. Thanks to all who took the time to say hello and introdcuce themselves: it was a genuine pleasure to meet so many new people (and old friends, of course!). It’s always super-motivating to hear about the cool things people are doing with Autodesk technology.</p><p>(Photo credits: myself, Lorenzo Villaggi, Thord Backe, Ben Muller, Marcel Ludwig.)</p>
