<p>If you’re curious about the AU Virtual experience (perhaps you’ve signed up and are wondering what it’s going to be like, perhaps you’re thinking about signing up but would like to know what you’re getting into, or perhaps you have no intention whatsoever of signing up but just want to know what 13,000+ other people are going to be doing next week :-) then check out this video:</p>  <p><object width="560" height="340"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/V6FngK_xiEs&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/V6FngK_xiEs&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="480" height="291"></embed></object></p>  <p>And if you end up attending AUv, I’m sure there are plenty of virtual seats left in <a href="http://au.autodesk.com/?nd=e_class&amp;session_id=5124&amp;jid=323682">my F# class</a>! :-)</p>
