<p>I’ve gone ahead and submitted two class proposals for Autodesk University 2022. If you think they should be part of <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2022/03/autodesk-university-2022-will-be-in-new-orleans.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">this year’s event</a>, I’d certainly appreciate you voting for them:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.autodesk.com/autodesk-university/conference/proposal/Voxel-based-Architectural-Space-Analysis-inside-Dynamo" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Voxel-based Architectural Space Analysis inside Dynamo</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Autodesk Research first created the Space Analysis toolkit - and its accompanying Dynamo package - to support 2D generative design workflows such as those used during Project Discover for the architectural layout of Autodesk&#39;s Toronto office. VASA - short for Voxel-based Architectural Space Analysis - takes these techniques to the next level, allowing the geometric exploration of architectural spaces in 3D for activities such as pathfinding, daylighting and visibility analysis. This session will look at the core algorithms underlying voxel-based space analysis and how they can be used from Dynamo, whether from Revit - and its generative design workflows - or FormIt.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.autodesk.com/autodesk-university/conference/proposal/Building-Digital-Twins-AEC-using-Forge" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Building Digital Twins for AEC using Forge</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Digital Twins have become a popular topic, in recent years, and Autodesk is heavily invested in helping customers and developers to use our platform technology to build their own. Autodesk Research began its journey exploring the integration of sensor data with BIM back in late 2009, when it started Project Dasher. Since 2016 Dasher has been using the Forge viewer for its visualization of IoT data alongside BIM - allowing its pilot users to gain insights from contextualizing real world performance data inside a 3D environment - and this session describes how Dasher&#39;s features have been integrated into the Forge platform via the Data Visualization Extension. It also looks at how Dasher has been able to harness Autodesk Tandem - the nascent Digital Twin platform for our customers to manage their facilities - to simplify workflows that would otherwise lead a tool such as Dasher to be unscalable for widespread adoption.</p>

<p>I have no doubt there are lots of great (and better!) proposals being submitted, so please do <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/autodesk-university/conference/call-for-proposals/voting" rel="noopener" target="_blank">search for classes that are of interest to you and vote for them</a>.</p>
