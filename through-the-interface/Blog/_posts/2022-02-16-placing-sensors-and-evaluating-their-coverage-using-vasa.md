<p>Last week I mentioned the <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2022/02/vasa-020-is-now-available.html" target="_blank">release of VASA 0.2.0</a>, which includes some new nodes and samples that raise some really interesting possibilities. I couldn’t help but come back to the “sensor coverage” sample (named <em>12-VASA-Sensor-Coverage.dyn</em>), in particular, as I can see so many possibilities for its use.</p><p>Here’s the description Rhys Goldstein included in the sample:</p><blockquote><p><em>A demonstration of how to combine sample point generation and proximity operations to select locations on walls and ceilings using the Voxel-based Architectural Space Analysis (VASA) package. In this example, the locations are used to place sensors and approximate their coverage.</em></p><p><em>First, sample points are generated using a path model and a set of parameters. The points are filtered to include only indoor locations.</em></p><p><em>Next, the points closest to walls are used to place wall-mounted sensors, each with a horizontally oriented pyramidal volume of coverage. The wall offset slider controls the fraction of wall-mounted sensors.</em></p><p><em>Finally, the remaining points are used to place ceiling-mounted sensors, each with a downward oriented conical volume of coverage.</em></p></blockquote><p>If you open up the sample you will see wall- and ceiling-mounted sensors placed throughout a building. Here’s an animation showing the selective display of the sensor locations themselves and the coverage cones, for wall sensors, ceiling sensors and then both together.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202942f999391200c-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="Sensor coverage" height="281" src="/assets/image_935459.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; float: none; display: block;" title="Sensor coverage" width="500" /></a></p><p>You can easily vary the parameters for the point sampling leading to the location of sensors. You can see the distribution being impacted by parameter changes.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20278806bdc46200d-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="Sensor spacing" height="312" src="/assets/image_490796.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; float: none; display: block;" title="Sensor spacing" width="500" /></a></p><p>Here you can see how parameter changes can affect the calculation of coverage cones for ceiling sensors (try saying that quickly).</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20278806bdc6b200d-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="Ceiling sensor cone angle and radius" height="312" src="/assets/image_257004.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; float: none; display: block;" title="Ceiling sensor cone angle and radius" width="500" /></a></p><p>I won’t dig more into the specifics of the sample’s implementation, in this post: to give it a try for yourself you can <a href="https://dynamobim.org/download/" target="_blank">install Dynamo Sandbox</a> (or just use Dynamo for Revit), install VASA 0.2.0 or higher from the Dynamo Package Manager (using <em>Packages</em> –&gt; <em>Search for a Package</em>) and then open the sample file (<em>12-VASA-Sensor-Coverage.dyn</em>). As a reminder, you can find the samples folder by opening the VASA package’s root folder from the Dynamo preferences… the sample is in the <em>extra</em> sub-folder.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202942f99945d200c-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="Finding the VASA sample folder" border="0" height="305" src="/assets/image_373334.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="Finding the VASA sample folder" width="500" /></a></p><p>This sample seems ripe for use as part of a generative design workflow: the inputs to the graph that place sensors could be modified by the generative design feature inside Revit, while metrics could be introduced that&#0160; measure the effectiveness of the placement. VASA has ready-to-use nodes that can count the voxels in a voxel model, something that would give you a numeric assessment of relative coverage of a space by a set of sensors.<br />An interesting trade-off to explore would be between the number of sensors (which you might want to minimise to keep costs down) versus the coverage in a space (as measured by counting voxels from the sensor cones).<br />There’s some really interesting potential here, I’m sure you’ll agree!</p>
