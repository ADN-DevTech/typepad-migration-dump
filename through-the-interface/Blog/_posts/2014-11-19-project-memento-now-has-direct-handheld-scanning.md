<p>Some <a href="http://www.recapproduct.com/blog/2014/11/whats-new-in-the-november-update-of-project-memento.html" target="_blank">exciting news</a> from the Reality Computing team: Project Memento – which has been <a href="https://beta.autodesk.com/callout/?callid=D69655022B4F42C880513D4E3085C7D0" target="_blank">updated to v1.0.11.3 on Autodesk Labs</a> – now supports direct input from the <a href="http://www.artec3d.com/hardware/artec-eva/" target="_blank">Artec 3D Eva scanner</a>. You can scan a 3D object or scene – generating a mesh – directly in the Memento software. I’ve been hoping/waiting for this to happen for some time.</p>  <p>Here’s a quick GIF showing – in broad strokes – how the process works. I’ve basically put a bunch of screenshots together – these were captured manually rather than at regular intervals – to show the flow in a lightweight manner, so please don’t attempt to use it to assess performance: the intention was just to show how scanner frames can lead to a mesh being generated.</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201bb07afcde6970d-pi"><img title="Artec scan" style="float: none; margin: 20px auto; display: block" alt="Artec scan" src="/assets/image_366014.jpg" width="400" height="218" /></a></p>  <p>You can currently only integrate a single scanning pass using Memento, but the team is working hard to support aggregation of multiple scans, too. They’re also hoping to support additional scanner models/brand… next on the list is Artec’s <a href="http://www.artec3d.com/hardware/artec-spider/" target="_blank">Spider</a>, which should be supported along with automatic alignment of multiple scans in a couple of weeks or so. I’d personally love to see <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2014/08/autocad-integration-samples-for-kinect-for-windows-2-part-4.html" target="_blank">scanning via Kinect v2</a> supported, but the initial focus is very much on professional-grade scanning devices: the Eva and Spider are currently in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=bl_sr_industrial?ie=UTF8&amp;field-brandtextbin=Artec+3D&amp;node=16310091" target="_blank">the $19-22K price range</a>, just to give you an idea.</p>  <p>More is happening with Memento, of course – the previously linked blog post mentions tighter A360 integration, reporting and export enhancements and <a href="http://www.3dconnexion.com/products/spacemousepro.html" target="_blank">SpaceMouse</a> integration – but for me this is the big ticket item of this release and nicely indicative of the direction in which things are headed.</p>
