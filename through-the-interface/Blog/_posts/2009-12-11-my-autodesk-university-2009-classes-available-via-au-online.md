<p>I’ve arrived at the end of my AU+East Asia tour, having spent the last 2 weeks in Las Vegas, San Francisco, Tokyo, Seoul and now Beijing. My blog is blocked by the Great Firewall of China, so while I can post this content via Typepad I can’t see the results (although I’m told I should be able to VPN into our Singapore office to bypass this restriction – I’ll give that a try, later on).</p>  <p>Later today (and today is currently Friday December 11th in China :-) you should be able to gain access to the sessions I delivered at this year’s <a href="http://www.autodesk.com/au">Autodesk University</a> via <a href="http://au.autodesk.com">AU Online</a>. One was an AU Virtual session on F# – which was recorded in a professional studio environment, and broadcast twice with live Q&amp;A during the week of AU – and the other was a physical session on IronPython and IronRuby which should have been recorded. I’m not sure how that one turned out – we’ll see. Both sessions related to using these programming languages in the context of AutoCAD development.</p>  <p>I also got interviewed – by chance, I happened to be in the audience – during one of the Design Slam events. It’s about 42 minutes in, in case the content is still accessible now that AU Virtual is over. Not that it’s of particular interest – I’d been at the event for about 5 minutes when someone stuck a microphone in my face… I couldn’t really comment on the event and felt more than a little foolish – but I I thought I’d mention it for completeness.</p>
