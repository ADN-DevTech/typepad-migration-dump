<p>Many of you will have noticed the blog's new design. Hopefully you will find the new look both pleasing to the eye and easier to read/navigate (I personally like the new design very much - even down to the way the comments are now listed and something as fundamental as the font's typeface and colour). There may be a few differences - such as the display of one month's post history in calendar view, rather than three - but I expect to readjust these items over the coming weeks. I'm also hoping to find a way to provide a master index with all the 270+ posts I've made to <em>Through the Interface</em> listed.</p> <p>If you have feedback or comments, please let me know, especially when it comes to issues or quirks with the new design. I'd like to share both positive and negative feedback with our web team, even if from my perspective I think they've done a great job. :-)</p> <p>For those of you who are new to the site, here's the previous look:</p> <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/WindowsLiveWriter/Through%20the%20Interface.png"><img style="border-top-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px" height="430" alt="Through the Interface" src="/assets/Through%20the%20Interface_thumb.png" width="409" border="0"></a> </p> <p>On another note: I've already received a comment asking whether the new blog photo is really of me. I can attest to the fact it was taken of me - in fact it was taken by an ex-DevTech colleague who is now a professional photographer in Las Vegas (please send me an email if you want his contact information - I'm sure he'd appreciate the business). I can't say what techniques he used to re-touch the photo, but I know he smoothed out at least a couple of blemishes. :-)</p> <p>And finally... I'd like to quickly pre-announce a couple of sister blogs that are in the works. Given the success of <em>Through the Interface</em> (and I'd really like to thank all of you readers who have kept me motivated to post so regularly over the last 2-and-a-bit years), we've decided to launch two more development-oriented Autodesk blogs. Here are a couple of teaser images - for now I won't say what topics they'll cover or who the authors will be, but I'd be curious to hear your guesses. :-)</p> <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/WindowsLiveWriter/Mod%20the%20Machine_1.png"><img style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="62" alt="Mod the Machine" src="/assets/Mod%20the%20Machine_thumb.png" width="244" border="0"></a> <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/WindowsLiveWriter/The%20Building%20Coder.png"><img style="border-top-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px" height="61" alt="The Building Coder" src="/assets/The%20Building%20Coder_thumb.png" width="244" border="0"></a></p>
