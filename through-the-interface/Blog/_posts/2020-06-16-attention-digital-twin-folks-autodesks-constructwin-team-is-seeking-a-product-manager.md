<p>There’s <a href="https://rolp.co/EaJSi">an exciting job posted</a> for a key role in a new project (product?) team at Autodesk named Constructwin. Here’s some information from the posting:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Do you want the opportunity to be part of a startup environment and have a big impact on a brand-new product? Are you looking to be at the forefront of innovative new technology that will ultimately help people imagine, design, and make a better world? If so, come join the Constructwin team at Autodesk! Our mission is to create Digital Twin technology and solutions that will transform how buildings are designed, built, and operated.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I won’t go into any more details on the technology, but this is an exciting opportunity for anyone fascinated by the potential for Digital Twins in the built environment and wants to help steer what could turn into a significant new offering for Autodesk. The Constructwin team is working closely with us over here in Autodesk Research, so there’s the added benefit that we’ll probably end up working closely together.</p>
<p>You may be wondering how Constructwin relates to <a href="https://dasher360.com">Dasher</a>: for now all I’ll say is that they’re highly complementary, so the Dasher team will be continuing to track and support Constructwin in whatever way we can.</p>
<p>So if you like the idea of becoming Product Manager for a new Autodesk product and steering it on its journey from 0 to 100, then apply today. I have no doubt it’s going to be a whole lot of fun!</p>
