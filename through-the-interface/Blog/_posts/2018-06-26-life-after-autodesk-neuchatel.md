<p>Given the <a href="http://keanw.com/2017/12/the-end-of-an-era-for-autodesk-switzerland.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">impending closure of our Neuchâtel office</a> – we have our big closing party on Thursday afternoon, although a few teams will still have people in the office until the end of August – there are a lot of former (and soon-to-be-former) Autodeskers starting to look for jobs in the region. Most were offered jobs in either Barcelona or the new Dublin office, but – given the salary differential to work in these locations and the currently booming Swiss economy, which has <a href="https://tradingeconomics.com/switzerland/unemployment-rate" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">around 2.5% unemployment nationwide</a> – the vast majority have chosen to accept their termination offers and stay local. Some will hopefully find jobs in the Neuchâtel region, but many will have to spread their nets further, whether to Bern, Fribourg or Lausanne (which are a tolerable commute away) or to Geneva or Zurich (which I’d say are not).</p>
<p>There are other options, though…</p>

<p>On Saturday I went to the opening of <a href="https://celestial.ch" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a new microbrewery</a> in our area. And when I say “our area”, it’s 550m from my home (score!).</p>
<p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad37c2ac8200d-pi" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img alt="My walk to the brewery" border="0" height="265" src="/assets/image_485025.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="My walk to the brewery" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>The brewer is an old friend of mine: when I joined Autodesk in the UK, back in 1995, Peter Danielsson was the European Escalation Support Manager based in Neuchâtel. He worked in a few different teams, over the years, until his departure from Autodesk a few years ago. Celestial Brewery is a dream of Peter’s that he’s managed to realise over the last year or two. It’s now open to the public and the beer is <em>really</em> good. If you know Peter or live in the Neuchâtel area and like beer, be sure to follow <a href="https://www.facebook.com/brasserie.celestial" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Celestial on Facebook</a>.</p>
<p>I’ve visited the brewery a few times over the last months in the lead-up to its opening. Here are a couple of snaps I took during these visits.</p>

<p>Saturday was a beautiful day and the opening was really well-attended. Peter gave several tours of the facility over the course of the day…</p>
<p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad37c2ad8200d-pi" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img alt="Peter giving a tour" border="0" height="500" src="/assets/image_504674.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="Peter giving a tour" width="333" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad37c2adc200d-pi" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img alt="A tour" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_118130.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="A tour" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>… and there was a tasting menu available for people to sample the various Celestial beers.</p>
<p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad35637e1200c-pi" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img alt="The list of Celestial beers" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_965183.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="The list of Celestial beers" width="500" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad39c0b96200b-pi" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img alt="6 out of 6" border="0" height="500" src="/assets/image_55667.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="6 out of 6" width="375" /></a></p>
<p>All were absolutely delicious. Peter’s clearly worked really hard to create a selection of interesting brews – ranging from a hoppy wheatbeer to a chocolatey stout, with a number of really interesting pale ales in-between – and I think he’s done an amazing job.</p>
<p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad37c2ae7200d-pi" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img alt="Me at the bar" border="0" height="334" src="/assets/image_549681.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="Me at the bar" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Peter is not the first ex-Autodesker to head in this direction, though. Here’s a picture of Peter with Philippe Martin, who left his job as a telecoms engineer at Autodesk back in 2014 to take over the family <a href="http://www.absinthe-originale.ch/homepage-absinthe-la-valote-martin/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">absinthe distillery</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad39c0b9a200b-pi" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img alt="The brewer meets the distiller, Peter and Philippe" border="0" height="500" src="/assets/image_630809.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="The brewer meets the distiller, Peter and Philippe" width="375" /></a></p>
<p>It’s of course purely coincidental that both of their businesses make alcoholic beverages, although I’m guessing that they have more than a few former colleagues as customers. ;-)</p>
<p>I find it really inspiring that both Peter and Philippe have managed to transition across from the software industry to (other) jobs that they love, in the process contributing significantly to the fabric of the local economy. I wish them every success in their respective endeavours, and look forward to discovering what they and other talented ex-Autodeskers will do in the future!</p>
