<p>I registered for AU 2012, yesterday. I had originally thought it was opening early for speakers, but apparently not: anyone can now <a href="https://www.autodeskuniversity2012.com/portal/newreg.ww" target="_blank">register to attend</a> and receive an early bird discount of $500 (before October 15).</p>  <p>If you’re interested in seeing what classes are scheduled for this year’s AU – which will be held from Nov 27-29 in the Mandalay Bay Hotel, Las Vegas – you can <a href="https://www.autodeskuniversity2012.com/connect/search.ww" target="_blank">browse the class catalog online</a>. Here are the classes I’m scheduled to deliver or participate in, for instance:<a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2017c3188cdca970b-pi" target="_blank"><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; margin: 20px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="My AU 2012 classes in the catalog" border="0" alt="My AU 2012 classes in the catalog" src="/assets/image_254847.jpg" width="465" height="397" /></a></p>  <p>As you can see, there’s more detail on the class timings than I provided in <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2012/07/thinking-about-au-2012-and-vacation.html" target="_blank">my previous post</a>:</p>  <ul>   <li><strong>CP3573 – AutoCAD Programming Gurus Go Head to Head</strong>       <ul>       <li>Tuesday, Nov 27, 10:30 AM - 12:00 PM </li>     </ul>   </li>    <li><strong>CP1914 – Moving code to the cloud – it’s easier than you think!</strong>       <ul>       <li>Tuesday, Nov 27, 1:30 PM - 3:00 PM <!--EndFragment--></li>     </ul>   </li>    <li><strong>CP4342-R – Cloud and mobile developer round-table</strong>       <ul>       <li>Tuesday, Nov 27, 3:30 PM - 5:00 PM <!--EndFragment--></li>     </ul>   </li>    <li><strong>CP1482 – AutoCAD – Meet the Experts</strong>       <ul>       <li>Tuesday, Nov 27, 5:30 PM - 7:00 PM </li>     </ul>   </li>    <li><strong>CP1921 – Developing a simple Metro-style application for Windows 8</strong>       <ul>       <li>Wednesday, Nov 28, 3:00 PM - 4:30 PM </li>     </ul>   </li> </ul>  <p>It looks like Tuesday is going to be a bit busy, but that’s how these things go – at least Wednesday will be a bit more relaxed. It does mean I won’t be spending much (probably any) time at Tuesday’s ADN DevLab, which is a bit of a shame.</p>  <p>I am happy my “cloud&quot; &amp; mobile” lecture is scheduled right before the associated round-table (this year’s name for the increasingly popular unconference sessions). It’ll be great to follow that topic with a more interactive (and no doubt quite animated) discussion.</p>  <p>I also have an AUv session that has been accepted:</p>  <ul>   <li><b>CM4783-V – <b>Secure Your AutoCAD Environment</b></b> </li> </ul>  <p>This one’s a bit different, in that it’s very much CAD manager/end-user focused. Should be an interesting experience.</p>  <p>On the Monday prior to AU starting, I’ll be attending <a href="http://au.autodesk.com/?nd=adn_conference_devlab&amp;und=1786" target="_blank">the ADN conference at AU</a>, as usual, and will try to pop by <a href="http://au.autodesk.com/?nd=designscript_workshop" target="_blank">the DesignScript Workshop</a> during the afternoon.</p>  <p>See you in Las Vegas! :-)</p>
