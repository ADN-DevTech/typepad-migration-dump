<p>Last night I completed a really interesting lab as part of <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2013/08/coursera-the-future-of-education.html" target="_blank">the linear algebra class that I’ve been studying</a>. The purpose of the lab was to build up – and make use of – some Python code to process an image taken at a certain angle and “straighten out” the perspective of an image. The processing was done using matrix operations to translate between coordinate systems – something that’s bread and butter when working with CAD, so I found it particularly interesting.</p>  <p>Here’s the image used as an example – a whiteboard with some writing that’s difficult to make out when viewed from this angle:</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2019104c069df970c-pi" target="_blank"><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 20px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="Angled view of a whiteboard" border="0" alt="Angled view of a whiteboard" src="/assets/image_225438.jpg" width="424" height="417" /></a></p>  <p>After running the code, here’s the resultant image that was generated and displayed (with some visual artifacts that I believe come from the display technology used, which basically creates a humungous HTML page with embedded SVG to generate the various pixels as skewed polygons with an RGB fill).</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2019104c0a1c0970c-pi" target="_blank"><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 20px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="Straightened view of the whiteboard" border="0" alt="Straightened view of the whiteboard" src="/assets/image_597324.jpg" width="470" height="344" /></a></p>  <p>The whole process had me thinking that there simply have to be interesting applications of this technique for CAD data, perhaps processing captured image data to de-skew it and map it into raster images in world coordinates. That was about as far as I got, though, even though I’ve tried to spend time today considering the possibilities.</p>  <p>Hence this blog post, which is really a call for suggestions. Does anyone have some ideas they’d like to share on a possible application for this type of processing? Right now the code is in Python – it would take some work to replicate in a more AutoCAD-friendly language (although that may be a good reason for me to look at <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2009/03/using-ironpython-with-autocad.html" target="_blank">IronPython</a> again, even if the code runs fairly slowly, as it currently stands). Please do post a comment to share your thoughts.</p>
