<p>After having <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2020/10/my-generative-design-presentation-from-sdsc-connect-2020-and-a-teaser-for-au-2020.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">talked about Autodesk Research’s collaboration with Philippe Starck and Kartell</a> to create the world’s first mass-produced, generatively-designed (and made from 100% recycled material!) chair, I decided to buy one. Well, two.</p>
<p>As I mentioned in the talk I gave at <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2020/09/register-for-thursdays-sdsc-connect-event-for-free.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the SDSC-Connect event</a>, I didn’t find a way to get an employee discount, but I’m proud enough of the work done by my colleagues in Research to put more money than I would normally into a couple of plastic chairs. This almost certainly makes my presentation for the SDSC-Connect event the most expensive I’ve ever given, at least in terms of what I’ve paid to deliver it. ;-)</p>
<p>Here they are:</p>
<p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2026be41cf307200d-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="AI Chairs" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_131977.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="AI Chairs" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Here are a couple of pics of the booklet the chairs come with. Mentioning Autodesk, of course!</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2026be41cf30f200d-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="Booklet front" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_731838.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="Booklet front" width="500" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20263e970bb2c200b-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="Booklet first page" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_539261.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" title="Booklet first page" width="500" /></a></p><p>Here’s a reminder of how the chair was generatively designed by the research team:</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2026be41cf317200d-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="AI chair optimisation" height="500" src="/assets/image_319024.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; float: none; display: block;" title="AI chair optimisation" width="500" /></a></p><p>Here’s the final output of the generative process:</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2026bde9e13d9200c-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="AI chair generative" height="540" src="/assets/image_629397.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; float: none; display: block;" title="AI chair generative" width="500" /></a></p><p>And here’s the final chair design after refinement by the Starck team:</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2026be41cf31b200d-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="AI chair final" height="540" src="/assets/image_563893.jpg" style="margin: 30px auto; float: none; display: block;" title="AI chair final" width="500" /></a></p><p>As I wanted two different colours, I didn’t get them delivered as a single unit. In fact, the black one came much sooner – as the retailer had plenty in stock – while they needed to order a pair of orange ones especially from Italy to fulfill my order (which means that <a href="https://pfister.ch" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Pfister.ch</a> probably now has a single orange chair in stock for someone else wanting to order one, in case).</p>
<p>This unfortunately meant that I didn’t get the fancy two-chair packaging. My manager, Tony Ruto, had bought himself a couple, earlier in the year, so he kindly shared a photo of the box they came in.</p>

<p>Anyway, it’s not often that you see the name of the company you work for on a product like this. Congratulations to Arthur Harsuvanakit, Mark Davis and the other members of the Autodesk Research team involved in making this awesome project happen!</p>
