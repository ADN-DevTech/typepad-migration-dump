<p>My successor over in the ADN team (and long-time friend and colleague), Stephen Preston, has just pointed me to <a href="http://careers.autodesk.com/san-rafael,-ca/consulting/jobid4357088-senior-developer-consultant-jobs" target="_blank">an online posting for a member of the DevTech team to be based in the Bay Area</a> (meaning either of our San Rafael or San Francisco offices).</p>  <p>They’re looking for a developer with AutoCAD experience who would be able to take a senior role within the DevTech organisation, interfacing with the local product teams and assuming some leadership responsibilities for DevTech’s worldwide, AutoCAD-focused workgroup. These positions come up very infrequently, so I strongly recommend applying if you’re interested.</p>  <p>The position has become available because Fenton Webb – who many of you will know from AU, DevDays or his online presence – has moved into a core development position within the company. The good news is that he’s still at Autodesk – and will no doubt be making important contributions to our products – but he’ll certainly be less visible externally. As his former direct manager, Stephen is certainly going to write something more detailed over on the AutoCAD DevBlog. I will simply wish Fenton well in his new role and anticipate great things coming from the group he has joined.</p>
