I was only really there to help kick things off and answer initial questions about using Dynamo with Refinery to implement Generative Design workflows, so it’s fantastic to see how things ended up.</p><p align="center"><br><iframe width="500" height="283" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/X_LNTIqhLPk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"></iframe><br></p><p>If you have follow-on questions about the various projects, I suggest contacting the <a href="https://twitter.com/UKDynUG" target="_blank">UK Dynamo User Group on Twitter</a>. I’m sure they’ll be happy to point you in the right direction.</p><p>While this was the first such Hackathon – one focused on the use of Dynamo and Refinery together – there will be others. One is happening in <a href="https://twitter.com/DynamoBIM/status/1121413001649823745" target="_blank">Melbourne, Australia on May 20-21, 2019</a> and I’ve already booked travel to come with my family to another just prior to BILT EUR in Edinburgh in October. I thoroughly recommend attending one, if you get the chance!</p>
