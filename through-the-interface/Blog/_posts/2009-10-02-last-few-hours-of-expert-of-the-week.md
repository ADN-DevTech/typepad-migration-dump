<p>Sorry for this somewhat lame post: today has not been the smoothest day, unfortunately. Firstly there was a minor systems glitch that meant my &quot;Expert of the Week&quot; session expired prematurely. This has now thankfully been resolved, so please go across to <a href="http://autocad.autodesk.com">the AutoCAD Exchange</a> and <a href="http://autocad.autodesk.com/?nd=ask_the_expert&amp;topic_id=29&amp;moderator_id=32">ask me some more questions</a> - there are now only a few hours left before the weekend! :-)</p>
<p>Even more frustratingly, I foolishly clicked on the &quot;a new version of Live Messenger is available, would you like to upgrade?&quot; piece of toast that popped up when I logged in, this morning. The installer process went ahead and upgraded Live Messenger (fine) but in the process chose to automatically upgrade my <a href="http://download.live.com/writer">Live Writer</a>, which I depend on for blogging (it&#39;s really a very cool tool). Unfortunately this upgrade process failed: it successfully uninstalled Live Writer but - try as I might - I have since found it absolutely impossible to install the new version or re-install the old one. Argh.</p>
<p>Which means I&#39;ve resorted to posting directly in the TypePad editor (which I haven&#39;t done for ages, although I do use it to tweak the odd post after authoring it). Hence the lame post.</p>
<p>Anyway, please do keep those questions coming - I&#39;d love to get past the 60 mark before the week is out!</p>
