<p>I’m back online after a great week in the Alps. One of the best parts of being back at home is having the chance to build my Christmas present – <a href="http://starwars.lego.com/en-us/Products/exclusive/10188.aspx" target="_blank">the LEGO Death Star</a>. At 3,803 pieces, it’s a bit of a monster: I could really have used <a href="http://ellipsis-autodesk.typepad.com/blog/lego-harry-potter-hogwarts-castle-instructions.html" target="_blank">a set of 3D instructions</a>, but had to make do with the 259-page, ring-bound instruction tome. I’m about halfway through and thoroughly enjoying it. :-)</p>  <p>I also had some fun playing with a present I bought my wife, a <a href="http://www.sony.co.uk/hub/nex-compact-camera-system" target="_blank">Sony NEX-5 camera</a>. I think I’ve managed to convince her it isn’t a <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Bowling%20Ball%20Present" target="_blank">bowling ball present</a>. The fact that I didn’t get <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_on_the_Fast_Lane" target="_blank">my name etched into the casing</a> probably helped.</p>  <p>In my attempts to understand the NEX-5’s feature-set – so I can educate others in my family in its use, of course (ahem) – I took some panoramas from the balcony of the chalet we’d rented.</p>  <p>As the sun was coming up, with fog covering the valley:</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20147e14379e3970b-pi" target="_blank"><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 0px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="Sunrise" border="0" alt="Sunrise" src="/assets/image_582097.jpg" width="479" height="75" /></a></p>  <p>By day:</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20148c74d07b1970c-pi" target="_blank"><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 0px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="By day" border="0" alt="By day" src="/assets/image_883029.jpg" width="479" height="75" /></a></p>  <p>And by night:</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20148c74d07c7970c-pi" target="_blank"><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 0px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="At night" border="0" alt="At night" src="/assets/image_998198.jpg" width="479" height="89" /></a></p>  <p>No manual stitching or editing required (although I’m sure they could be improved with a bit of Photoshopping).</p>  <p>I’m now almost done dealing with my email and comment backlog, so I expect to be back with more technical posts sometime this week.</p>  <p>Happy New Year to you all!</p>
