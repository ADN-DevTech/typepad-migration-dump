<p>It seems to come around sooner each year, but then that’s probably just me getting older, as everything else also seems to. :-)</p>  <p>The <a href="http://www.autodeskevents.com/au2010/?event=speaker.call">call for proposals for AU 2010</a> is now open, and will remain so until May 14. The event itself will be held from November 30 to December 2 at the Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas.</p>  <p>Over on the AU <a href="http://au.autodesk.com/?nd=blaug&amp;rss_data_id=16495">BLAUG</a>, it explains that we’re looking for:</p>  <ul>   <li>Fresh topics and content </li>    <li>More advanced courses</li>    <li>Business management solutions</li>    <li>Product specifics</li>    <li>Tips &amp; Tricks</li> </ul>  <p>Customization and programming topics are – as ever – extremely popular sessions at AU, and definitely fit into at least one of these categories. My team will be presenting a range of development-related sessions at this year’s AU. Go ahead and submit your own proposals, and perhaps we’ll see each other there!</p>
