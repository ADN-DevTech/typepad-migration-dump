<p>In this week’s Floppy Friday we stumble across a diskette from the German Commodore 64 magazine, <a href="https://www.c64-wiki.com/wiki/Game_On#1992" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Game On, from June 1992</a>.</p>
<p>It contains three games – <a href="http://www.vgmpf.com/Wiki/index.php?title=The_Pearl_of_Dawn_(C64)" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Pearl of Dawn</a>, <a href="https://csdb.dk/release/?id=131470" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Twin Down</a> and <a href="https://csdb.dk/release/?id=173919" rel="noopener" target="_blank">No Deeper Meaning</a> – and a couple of graphics/music demos – Mstocephaloid/XS and Destination ‘91. I didn’t know they were demos when I loaded them, of course, but we got there eventually.</p>

<p>Being on a floppy that basically came free with a magazine, none of these are especially “top shelf” (I use that in <a href="https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/top-shelf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the North American sense of the term, although in fairness it’s also true for the British meaning</a> ;-). It was still fun to explore, though, just to get a sense for what the C64 scene was like in the early 90s.</p>
