You have 3 weeks until it starts, so it’s a good time to consider joining the fun.</p>  <p>Here’s a note from Jim Quanci and Stephen Preston, describing the value of the event:</p> <center><iframe height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/zLKZB2sdxyA?rel=0" frameborder="0" width="420" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></center>  <p>At the risk of repeating what’s already been said: curated online marketplaces are becoming the preferred way for software users to find add-on functionality. This is also true of Autodesk software, with a million users a year visiting the Autodesk Exchange Apps store.</p>  <p>It seems to me that now would be a great time to get in on the action, if you haven’t already.</p>
