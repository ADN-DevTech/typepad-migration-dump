<p>In <a href="https://youtu.be/9KIb56eK5l0" target="_blank">this week’s episode</a> we take a look at three classic Commodore 64 games. The first game, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Ninja_2" target="_blank">The Last Ninja 2</a>, is a sequel to a game we played last week, of course. The second game, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghostbusters:_The_Video_Game" target="_blank">Ghostbusters</a>, is one I used to play on my ZX Spectrum as a child, although the C64 version looks quite different. The last game, <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/c64/fighter-pilot_" target="_blank">Fighter Pilot</a>, was basically incomprehensible, but there you go.</p><p align="center"><br></p><p align="center"><iframe width="500" height="283" title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9KIb56eK5l0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"></iframe></p><p align="center"><br></p><p>Here’s the cover art for these three games (although I’m not completely sure about the last one).</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2026bded93260200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="223" title="Last Ninja 2, Ghostbusters, Fighter Pilot" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Last Ninja 2, Ghostbusters, Fighter Pilot" src="/assets/image_750448.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>One of these days I’m going to have a “ZX Spectrum classics” episode, where I load games I used to play on the Speccie as a child. I don’t have most of these on floppy, so some work will be required to find C64 versions and transfer them to disk. High on my list are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tir_Na_Nog_(video_game)" target="_blank">Tir Na Nog</a> (the only Gargoyle game that made it to the C64) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lords_of_Midnight" target="_blank">The Lords of Midnight</a>.</p>
