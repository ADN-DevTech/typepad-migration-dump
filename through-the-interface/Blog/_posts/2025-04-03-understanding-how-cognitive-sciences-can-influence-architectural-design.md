<p>I'm roughly halfway through a class on <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2025/02/a-course-on-neuroscience-and-design-at-polidesign.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Neuroscience and Design</a>, which has introduced me to many interesting new concepts and many interesting new people, too. It's through this class that I've connected with the <a href="https://fcl.ethz.ch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Future Cities Lab</a> - which has staff both at ETH Zurich and its satellite location in Singapore - who are performing some really valuable research.</p>
<p>They’re currently running a survey to understand how cognitive sciences impact architectural design. Here’s a description of what they’re looking for in their own words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This research aims to explore how well knowledge from cognitive sciences is being integrated into architectural design. As more studies examine how our surroundings affect our experiences, it is crucial to apply these insights to improve design practices. Therefore, this study will investigate whether and how current research findings are being used in architecture and identify ways to enhance this integration for better design outcomes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you have worked as an architect or designer, it would be great if you could spend 20-30 minutes of your time to <a href="http://tinyurl.com/arch-cog" target="_blank" rel="noopener">complete this survey</a>.</p>
