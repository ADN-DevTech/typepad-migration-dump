<p>Last week I was in Singapore for our annual, internal, two-day technical summit. Upwards of 500 members of Autodesk’s various engineering and technical teams gathered together at the iconic <a href="http://www.marinabaysands.com/" target="_blank">Marina Bay Sands</a> for the event.</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b7c7a8bcca970b-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="To the Marina Bay Sands via the double-helix bridge" border="0" height="288" src="/assets/image_206256.jpg" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 20px auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" title="To the Marina Bay Sands via the double-helix bridge" width="420" /></a></p>  <p>The hotel was pretty amazing. Having been told my room number (4619), I first exited the elevator at the 4th floor. It’s only then that I realised the rooms on each floor were numbered in double digits, and so my room was on the 46th!</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201bb084be6fb970d-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="The view from my room" border="0" height="139" src="/assets/image_723745.jpg" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 20px auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" title="The view from my room" width="564" /></a></p>  <p>While I didn’t end up making much use of the hotel’s facilities – aside from the conference centre, of course – I did end up taking an early morning swim in the <a href="http://www.marinabaysands.com/sands-skypark/infinity-pool.html" target="_blank">infinity pool</a> on the roof (the 57th floor), each morning. From what I can tell there isn’t a time of day when the pool isn’t bristling with selfie-sticks held by narcissistic millennials.</p>  <p>Hypocritically, here’s a quick video I took using my GoPro. It wasn’t on a stick, though, in case that counts for anything. And yes, you don’t see that many selfies being taken in the background, so of course I was exaggerating for effect.</p>  <p style="text-align: center">   <br /><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JNF0hbKCfGU?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" width="560"></iframe></p>  <p>&#0160;</p>  <p>This is the first time the Tech Summit has been held in Singapore: prior venues have been Shanghai (2010 &amp; 2011), San Francisco (2012), <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2013/06/money-designed-with-autocad.html" target="_blank">Boston</a> (2013) and <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2014/06/toronto.html" target="_blank">Toronto</a> (<a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2014/06/3-things-i-learned-at-last-weeks-technical-summit.html" target="_blank">2014</a>). I’ve been lucky enough to have attended all but the first one of these (at the time I was managing a team and it was more relevant for some of them to attend than me), and each has been really valuable.</p>  <p>As usual, with such events, the value is partly with the information that gets shared but mainly from the connections that are made between participants: I interacted with a great many people from across the company, many of whom I’d (at best) interacted with previously by email. And people are working on such cool stuff… it’s such a great chance to interact with a diverse set of talented people.</p>  <p>I won’t go into details on any internal sessions – and there were obviously a lot of details shared on internal projects – but there were a few external sessions that stood out for me.</p>  <p><strong>Day 1</strong></p>  <p>The first day started with keynotes from <a href="http://autodesk.com/pr-buzzkross" target="_blank">Buzz Kross</a> (Senior VP of our Design, Lifecycle and Simulation division) and <a href="http://www.autodesk.com/company/newsroom/corporate-info/executive-bios/jeff-kowalski" target="_blank">Jeff Kowalski</a> (Autodesk’s CTO). Buzz talked about the company’s strategy for the Manufacturing industry while Jeff focused on opportunities for internal engineering collaboration. Both very worthwhile.</p>  <p>The rest of the morning I attended internal sessions, but the afternoon was spent in a great, hands-on workshop by an external trainer, <a href="https://twitter.com/shawndrost" target="_blank">Shawn Drost</a> from <a href="https://twitter.com/hackreactor" target="_blank">Hack Reactor</a>, who talked about the future of the Web platform. The vision Shawn presented is really interesting and relates to the increased use of compilers such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emscripten" target="_blank">Emscripten</a> to take code written in languages like C/C++ and target the browser via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asm.js" target="_blank">asm.js</a> and (in due course) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebAssembly" target="_blank">WebAssembly</a> (wasm). This – according to Shawn – is the next big wave of the web. The <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/webassembly/" target="_blank">WebAssembly</a> project looks to be really interesting – you can find out more about it <a href="https://medium.com/javascript-scene/what-is-webassembly-the-dawn-of-a-new-era-61256ec5a8f6" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/javascript-scene/why-we-need-webassembly-an-interview-with-brendan-eich-7fb2a60b0723" target="_blank">here</a>. While the initial focus of WebAssembly is to hook into <a href="http://llvm.org" target="_blank">LLVM</a> – which is used by much of the software industry – Microsoft’s participation presumably means that Visual Studio will eventually be able to target wasm, too. Interesting times.</p>  <p><strong>Day 2</strong></p>  <p>The second day’s keynotes were external. They started with one from <a href="https://twitter.com/dominicwilcox" target="_blank">Dominic Wilcox</a>, an artist/designer from the UK who wrote an excellent little book called <a href="http://variationsonnormal.com" target="_blank">Variations on Normal</a>. Dominic’s entertaining presentation was both whimsical and inspiring… but then I prefer <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2014/07/steampunking-a-morgan-3-wheeler-using-fusion-360.html" target="_blank">cars with three wheels</a>, so it was always going to resonate with me. :-)</p>  <p>Dominic tweeted about the session and happened to include a shot of me:</p>  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en">   <p dir="ltr" lang="en">Just gave a talk about creativity to 400 Autodesk 3d software engineers in Singapore. <a href="http://t.co/T1Jz8U5dt0">pic.twitter.com/T1Jz8U5dt0</a></p> — Dominic Wilcox (@dominicwilcox) <a href="https://twitter.com/dominicwilcox/status/613912078982590464">June 25, 2015</a></blockquote> <script charset="utf-8" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" type="text/javascript"></script>  <p>The next keynote was by Singapore-based <a href="https://twitter.com/sanguit" target="_blank">Sangeet Choudary</a>, who talked to us about “<a href="http://platformed.info" target="_blank">platform thinking</a>”. Music to my ears, given my focus on APIs and developer-oriented platforms.</p>  <p>The next five sessions I attended were internal, finding out more about projects as diverse as reality capture feature extraction, A360 viewing and collaboration (on web and mobile) and the extensibility of <a href="http://dynamobim.org" target="_blank">Dynamo</a>.</p>  <p>The second day wrapped up with a closing keynote from <a href="http://autodesk.com/pr-amarhanspal" target="_blank">Amar Hanspal</a> followed by the presentation of internal engineering awards (which have been branded “Techies” :-), the first time Autodesk has done such a thing. I’d been nominated in a couple of categories and ended up receiving the award for “Autodesk Technology Ambassador”: something that would not have happened if it weren’t for this blog and its readers. A great honour… especially as there were only six individual awards presented (another of which – for Open Source Evangelist – was won by my friend and <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2015/05/cooling-down-after-the-sf-vr-hackathon.html" target="_blank">VR Hackathon teammate</a>, <a href="https://github.com/larsxschneider" target="_blank">Lars Scheider</a>). The AutoCAD security feature team also won a well-deserved team award for their work in that area.</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201bb084cd04b970d-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="Award at the Tech Summit" border="0" height="271" src="/assets/image_445098.jpg" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 20px auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" title="Award at the Tech Summit" width="404" /></a></p>  <p>The trophies were – of course – designed using Autodesk software and then 3D printed in <a href="http://www.shapeways.com/materials/metallic-plastic" target="_blank">metallic plastic</a>. They’re very cool:</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201bb084cd053970d-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="My 3D printed &quot;Techie&quot; trophy" border="0" height="271" src="/assets/image_339668.jpg" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 20px auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" title="My 3D printed &quot;Techie&quot; trophy" width="404" /></a></p>  <p>Then it was off to the closing party, held at the incredible <a href="http://www.gardensbythebay.com.sg" target="_blank">Gardens by the Bay</a>. That place is <span style="text-decoration: underline">really</span> trippy at night: it’s like a cross between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fictional_universe_of_Avatar" target="_blank">Pandora</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endor_(Star_Wars)" target="_blank">Endor</a> (hmm – Pandor or Pendora?). The giant mushrooms all glowed blue when we were there, so presumably they’re all powered by <a href="http://meethue.com" target="_blank">Hue</a>… now there’s a remote control I’d like to hack: imagine going into those gardens and rotating the colour wheel!</p>  <p>After the official party wrapped up, we managed to find a bar on top of one of the glowing mushrooms to carry on the discussions until they, in turn, asked us to leave (but only because it was closing… honest :-).</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b8d13229d4970c-pi" target="_blank"><img alt="Gardens by the Bay" border="0" height="288" src="/assets/image_4037.jpg" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 20px auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" title="Gardens by the Bay" width="420" /></a></p>  <p>All in all another great experience. I hope I get to keep attending these summits… it’s like getting a brief, annual glimpse of geek heaven.</p>  <p><span style="color: #a5a5a5">photo credit: </span><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/51614308@N04/7617491362"><span style="color: #a5a5a5">Gardens by the Bay</span></a><span style="color: #a5a5a5"> via </span><a href="http://photopin.com"><span style="color: #a5a5a5">photopin</span></a><a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/"><span style="color: #a5a5a5">(license)</span></a></p>
