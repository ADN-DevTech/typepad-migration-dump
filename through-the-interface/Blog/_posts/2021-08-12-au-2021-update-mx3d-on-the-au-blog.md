<p>The count-down to Autodesk University 2021 continues, with <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/autodesk-university/conference/overview" target="_blank">registration for the event now open</a>. I’ve gone ahead and registered, as I expect many of you will at some point during the remaining 54 days. It’s free, after all, and I’m sure will have lots of great content, as usual. Be sure to put the dates in your calendar – October 5-7 for the Americas, October 6-8 for EMEA &amp; APAC, October 13-14 for East Asia.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20278803fafd1200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="312" title="AU 2021 calendar" style="margin: 30px auto; float: none; display: block;" alt="AU 2021 calendar" src="/assets/image_424504.jpg"></a></p><p>The timing of this year’s event – being several weeks earlier – means that it falls during our children’s half-term break. This year – all being well – we’ll be scuba-diving in Sardinia, so I’m not entirely sure what my level of participation in AU will be, after all: I don’t have a class to deliver, so at this stage I’m quite possibly going to keep my involvement to a minimum (despite <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2021/07/registration-is-now-open-for-autodesk-university-2021.html" target="_blank">my previous plan to host some kind of meetup</a>).</p><p>That said, the <a href="https://forge.autodesk.com/blog/registration-forge-hackathon-au-2021-here" target="_blank">AU Hackathon is happening the week before AU</a>, so I’ll definitely do my best to participate in that. If you’re working with Forge – or interested in learning it – then be sure to check <a href="https://forge.autodesk.com/AU" target="_blank">what the Forge team has planned for AU and the weeks leading up to it</a>.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2026bdee7e028200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="250" title="Forge Hackathon at AU 2021" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Forge Hackathon at AU 2021" src="/assets/image_976931.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Finally, <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/autodesk-university/blog/Amsterdams-3D-Printed-MX3D-Bridge-and-Future-Smart-Infrastructure-2021" target="_blank">the MX3D bridge project was featured on the AU blog yesterday</a>.
