<p>Well, through them, anyway.</p>

<p>Just letting you know that I'll be away from my desk, and from this blog, for the next week or so. We're heading through the Alps to Italy: first to Milan and then down to Ascoli Piceno, where an old friend is getting married.</p>

<p>We decided to take the train, which should be interesting. It's 4 hours from Switzerland to Milan, plus another 5 or so hours from Milan to the rail hub nearest to Ascoli P. Luckily we have family in Milan and so get to spend time with them and break the journey in each direction.</p>

<p>Back in a week!</p>
