<p>I’m up in the mountains, this week, but managed to record an episode of Floppy Friday over the weekend, so we don’t skip a week. At least not this week. :-)</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/YWALy8QX-vw" rel="noopener" target="_blank">This week’s episode</a> takes a look at four Commodore 64 games, three of which worked fine. We start with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rambo_(1985_video_game)" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Rambo – First Blood Part II</a> – a game I’d been looking for for some time – then play <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sword_of_Honour_(video_game)" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Sword of Honour</a>, a classic fighting game. We then try to play <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superstar_Ice_Hockey" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Superstar Ice Hockey</a>, and while it seemed to load fine, I couldn’t find a way to play it. Oh well. We then wrap up by playing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharaoh%27s_Revenge" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Pharoah’s Revenge</a>.</p>

<p>Rambo, in particular, seems to have been very well-received, getting <a href="http://www.zzap64.co.uk/cgi-bin/displaypage.pl?issue=053&amp;page=058&amp;thumbstart=0&amp;magazine=zzap" rel="noopener" target="_blank">an impressive 96% review in episode 56 of Zzap!64 magazine</a>:</p>

<p>That’s it for this week. Be sure to let me know if you remember playing any of these games, or have a game you&#39;d like me to look for to showcase in a future episode.</p>
