<p>After a longer-than-anticipated break, Stephen and Fenton are back with an all-new ADN DevCast. This one focuses on developing applications to work with AutoCAD for Mac.</p>  <p><a href="http://download.autodesk.com/media/adn/ADN_DevCast_Episode_5/ADN_DevCast_Episode_5.html" target="_blank"><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 0px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="ADN DevCast Episode 5" border="0" alt="ADN DevCast Episode 5" src="/assets/image_357452.jpg" width="479" height="299" /></a></p>  <p>They’ve managed to keep the timing of the DevCast down to 20 minutes, so we’re trying just posting this online (rather than having a separate download for offline viewing). Do post a comment if that doesn’t work well for you.</p>
