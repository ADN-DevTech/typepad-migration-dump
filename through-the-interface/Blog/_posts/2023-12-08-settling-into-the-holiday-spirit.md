<p>It feels good to be easing into the end of the year after a hectic - but fantastic - AU 2023.</p>
<p>For me it started with the Autodesk Switzerland holiday gathering in Bern.<a href="/assets/image_608407.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Autodesk Switzerland holiday gathering" src="/assets/image_608407.jpg" alt="Autodesk Switzerland holiday gathering" width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a>I was able to catch up with Jeremy Tammik, who I’m happy to say is recovering very well after a 6m (!) fall.<a href="/assets/image_839425.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Kean and Jeremy" src="/assets/image_839425.jpg" alt="Kean and Jeremy" width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>The week after I was invited along to the Lausanne Christmas Market for some hot wine and fondue with the team - and other fellow interviewees - from the Conversation Constructive podcast. (My episodes will be airing in the new year, in case you speak French and want a good laugh.)</p>

<p>Within our Research team we had a really fun virtual escape game. It was really a blast.</p>

<p>We’ve had some unseasonal (these days, anyway) early snow in the area, which definitely adds some magic.<a href="/assets/image_586980.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Holiday spirit in Neuchatel" src="/assets/image_586980.jpg" alt="Holiday spirit in Neuchatel" width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Which also means the ski resorts are open earlier than usual. Last Friday I headed up with my son to Adelboden (despite heavy snow, forgotten chains and a landslide-induced detour) and had the mountain to ourselves on the Saturday (it wasn’t great visibility) and shared it with huge crowds on the Sunday (it was sunny with fresh snow).</p>

<p>Aside from this I've been thoroughly enjoying my early morning coding sessions for this year’s <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2023" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Advent of Code</a>. It somehow seems harder (maybe I'm just getting older?) but I am having a blast.<a href="/assets/image_638952.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Advent of Code 2023" src="/assets/image_638952.jpg" alt="Advent of Code 2023" width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>If anyone is doing AoC and wants to join a Private Leaderboard, do drop me a note. I’m on a few right now (and being in Europe I have a natural advantage, as the puzzles drop at 6am ;-), but always happy to join more.</p>
