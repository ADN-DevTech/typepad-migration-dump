<p>Forge Accelerators have always been BYOD.</p><p>First they were “Bring Your Own Device”, then (on going virtual) they were also “Bring Your Own Drinks” and now for the upcoming event – on <strong>December 7-11 2020</strong> – we’re giving people the opportunity to “Build Your Own Dasher”. BYOD<sup>3</sup>!</p><p>Attendees at the <a href="https://forge.autodesk.com/accelerator-program" target="_blank">Candy Cane accelerator</a> (love those codenames) will <a href="https://forge.autodesk.com/blog/forge-data-visualization-components-early-access" target="_blank">get early access to to the Forge viewer’s Data Visualization Extension</a> – and the source code for <a href="https://hyperion.autodesk.io" target="_blank">the reference application that shows how to use it</a> – which will greatly simplify the process of building a Digital Twin using Forge. (Something that was talked about at Autodesk University 2020 during <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/autodesk-university/conference/forge" target="_blank">the Forge keynote</a>, <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/autodesk-university/class/Forge-Road-Map-2020" target="_blank">the Forge road map session</a>, <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/autodesk-university/class/Forge-Road-Map-Visual-Insights-Visualizing-Data-Your-Models-2020" target="_blank">this product briefing</a> and <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/autodesk-university/class/Lessons-Project-Dasher-Building-Digital-Twin-Using-Forge-2020" target="_blank">my own AU class</a>.)</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20263e97a9016200b-pi"><img width="500" height="312" title="Hyperion" style="margin: 30px auto; float: none; display: block;" alt="Hyperion" src="/assets/image_967279.jpg"></a></p><p>So if you’ve ever wanted to build something like <a href="https://dasher360.com" target="_blank">Dasher</a> – and would like to take advantage of focused assistance from Autodesk experts to help you do so – then this is a great opportunity. <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/autodesk-virtual-forge-accelerator-candy-cane-december-7-11-2020-registration-123156814347" target="_blank">Apply today!</a></p><p>Forge Accelerators are a great way to kickstart development projects: based on what I’ve seen during previous events, it’s pretty likely participants will have something functional in time for the holidays.</p>
