As it’s May the Fo<strong>u</strong>rth – yes, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_Day" target="_blank">Star Wars Day</a> – I thought I’d have a little fun and see what I could write using the venerable stack-based programming language, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forth_(programming_language)" target="_blank">Forth</a>. For those of you who aren’t aware, Forth has a long history with Autodesk and , having been at the core of <a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/atlast/" target="_blank">ATLAST</a>, the Autodesk Threaded Language Application System Toolkit. ATLAST had <a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/atlast/atlast.html" target="_blank">noble intentions</a>: to allow host applications to expose a common API or macro language that executed efficiently and with very low memory overhead.</p><p>By the time I joined Autodesk it was unfortunately no longer a thing, but 30 years later I thought it was probably time to have a crack at writing some Forth code. I found an <a href="https://repl.it/languages/forth" target="_blank">online Forth interpreter</a>, and started having a go.</p><p>Here’s what I came up with – you can <a href="https://repl.it/@KeanW/TieFighter" target="_blank">open the code</a> and run it yourself, if you’re interested. It’s a very rudimentary representation of a TIE fighter, in case you couldn’t tell.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20263e8607165200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="325" title="TIE Fighter created in Forth" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="TIE Fighter created in Forth" src="/assets/image_51494.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Forth is a tricky language, in that data needs to be placed on a global stack before being operated upon. So you can create sub-routines, but it’s a gnarly business to maintain and reuse the values on the stack within it. I’m sure there are ways I could have made the above code more maintainable (there’s lots of hardcoded nastiness) but I managed to get something working, at least.</p><p>So, with that… May the Forth be with you, always!</p>
