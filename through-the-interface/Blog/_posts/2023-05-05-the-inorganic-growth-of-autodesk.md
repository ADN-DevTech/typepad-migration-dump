<p>It’s been a fantastic week in Dallas at <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2023/04/putting-the-techx-in-texas.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">TechX 2023</a>. I’ll post more about the event next week, but in the meantime I just wanted to share a graphic that was displayed prominently in the exhibition area: it was a wild trip down memory lane for me, at least.</p>

<p>It plots Autodesk’s Merger &amp; Acquisition activity throughout the company’s history (from our founding right up to March 2023 and the <a href="https://adsknews.autodesk.com/en/news/connecting-aec-customer-data/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">acquisition of UNIFI</a>). Daniel Russell, from our HR organisation, kindly shared the source document. Daniel is working to help smooth the integration of people joining Autodesk through acquisition – we’re lucky to have him working on this, as my recollection is that this hasn’t always been a straightforward process.</p>

<p>It’s fascinating to see Autodesk’s inorganic growth plotted in this way. Having worked for many years in our Developer Network organisation, many former (and even a few current) partner names in the list are very familiar to me, although there are also many I don’t remember.</p>
<p>If the image triggers any good memories for you, please post a comment!</p>
