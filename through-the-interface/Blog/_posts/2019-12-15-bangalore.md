<p>On Wednesday morning I headed off at the crack of dawn to Geneva to fly back out to India. The sun was coming up across the lake – and the Alps behind it – as the train flew towards the airport.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4d2aa08200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Dawn across the lake from the train" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Dawn across the lake from the train" src="/assets/image_79600.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>I changed flights in Heathrow, heading onwards to Bangalore.<p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4d2aa0e200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="375" height="500" title="Flight to Bangalore" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Flight to Bangalore" src="/assets/image_780592.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>For once I had a World Traveller Plus seat – and a bulkhead, to boot – which I definitely enjoyed. The only downside was the combination of my aging Bose noise-cancelling headphones giving up the ghost partway through the flight with a tantruming toddler across the aisle from me. I don’t know whether the two things are linked (interestingly only the side nearest the toddler stopped working, which seems to indicate causality).</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4a980c3200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="A comfy seat for once" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="A comfy seat for once" src="/assets/image_465027.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>It was uneventful arriving in Bangalore and passing customs and immigration.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4f74eca200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Arriving in Bangalore" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Arriving in Bangalore" src="/assets/image_893610.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Bangalore airport continues to modernise: it had a number of new shops open outside, as well as a very handy Uber Zone.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4f74ed0200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="The Uber Zone" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="The Uber Zone" src="/assets/image_775713.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>On the way to the place I was staying I snapped this shot of the venerable Cantonment Station.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4a980cf200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Cantonment station" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Cantonment station" src="/assets/image_208628.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>I love being back in India for the colours and some of the smells.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4f74ef4200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Temple" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Temple" src="/assets/image_923008.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>It’s still a country of contradictions, of course.

I did try using Uber to hail an autorickshaw, which didn’t work well for me. It was fun seeing them zooming around on the app, though.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4a980fd200c-pi" target="_blank"><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4f74efa200b-pi" target="_blank"><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4f74ef4200b-pi" target="_blank"><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4d2aa4d200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="341" height="700" title="UberAuto" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="UberAuto" src="/assets/image_755656.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>One of the main reasons for me passing by Bangalore was to take care of some family-related admin: my uncle – who lived in Bangalore – passed away during the summer, and I needed to transfer some accounts. (Some people may not know that my mother is of Indian origin and grew up in Bangalore, which is one of the reasons I was open to moving there from 2003 to 2005.)</p><p>Anything bureaucratic in India is intensely frustrating, and I found myself at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayo_Hall_(Bangalore)" target="_blank">Mayo Hall</a> a few times to get copies of my uncle’s death certificates notarised as well as affidavits – on both 20 rupee and 100 rupee stamp paper – stating that both my and my uncle’s middle names were optional. (This is just an example of the types of hoops you need to jump through. Fun!)</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4f74ee2200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Notaries" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Notaries" src="/assets/image_949494.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>The notary who helped me was extremely competent, though, which was the cloud’s silver lining.<a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4f74eec200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="Our notary" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Our notary" src="/assets/image_264618.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>After two days of running around and dealing with paperwork (I could barely sign my name by the end of it), it was a pleasure to head to Autodesk Bangalore to catch up with Jim Quanci and his Bangalore-based team. It was pure – but a very happy – coincidence that Jim was passing through Bangalore at exactly the same time as me. Luckily Viru made me aware of it at AU in Las Vegas.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4d2aa30200d-pi" target="_blank"><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4a980fd200c-pi" target="_blank"><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4f74f04200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="375" title="On the roof of Divyasree Chambers" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="On the roof of Divyasree Chambers" src="/assets/image_238419.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Jim and I caught up for some time before heading up to the roof for one of my favourite views of Bangalore.</p><p><p><p><p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4d2aa38200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="375" height="500" title="Stylised sunset" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Stylised sunset" src="/assets/image_559506.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4d2aa38200d-pi" target="_blank"><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4a98106200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="165" title="Panoramic dusk" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Panoramic dusk" src="/assets/image_306604.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>The office building seems to have been refurbished significantly since I worked there back in the oughties.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4a98111200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="375" height="500" title="The top floor of the office" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="The top floor of the office" src="/assets/image_729213.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20240a4f74f13200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="375" height="500" title="Looking down through the floors" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Looking down through the floors" src="/assets/image_306450.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>For dinner we headed to Kudla, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mangalorean_cuisine" target="_blank">Mangalorean</a> restaurant I used to visit regularly with my family, back in the day.
