<p>On Monday I headed to Zurich airport with our eldest son to hop across to Oslo.<a href="/assets/image_746180.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Feeling the SAS" border="0" height="500" src="/assets/image_746180.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Feeling the SAS" width="375" /></a></p>
<p>He’s between semesters at Uni - waiting for his exam results to trickle in - and it’s great we’re getting the chance to get a change of air for a few days.<a href="/assets/image_33436.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Ready to fly" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_33436.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Ready to fly" width="500" /></a>It’s rare that I sit in a window seat, so I was sure to capture the view as we left Zurich...</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_990758.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Leaving Zurich" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_990758.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Leaving Zurich" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>… and arrived in snowy Oslo. The weather had impacted our trip very slightly - a 30-minute delay to our 2-hour flight - but we were still happy to touch down in Norway.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_869665.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Landing in Oslo" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_869665.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Landing in Oslo" width="500" /></a>We immediately got the sense it was going to be cold.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_968616.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Brrr" border="0" height="500" src="/assets/image_968616.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Brrr" width="375" /></a></p>
<p>I hadn’t been to Oslo in more than 25 years, but there was still something familiar about the airport, somehow.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_394368.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Oslo airport" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_394368.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Oslo airport" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>The best way to get into the city is via the Flytoget high-speed train.<a href="/assets/image_30319.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Taking the Flytoget into the city" border="0" height="500" src="/assets/image_30319.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Taking the Flytoget into the city" width="375" /></a></p>
<p>It’s really a fantastic train, made even better by the snowy views as you fly through the Norwegian countryside.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_564900.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="A great train" border="0" height="500" src="/assets/image_564900.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="A great train" width="375" /></a>And into the city, too.<a href="/assets/image_209208.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Zooming into the city" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_209208.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Zooming into the city" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Getting off at the National Theatre station, we had a fairly short walk through the park to our hotel.<a href="/assets/image_490030.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="The National Theatre" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_490030.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="The National Theatre" width="500" /></a></p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_864426.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Oslo in the snow" border="0" height="500" src="/assets/image_864426.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Oslo in the snow" width="375" /></a></p>
<p>As my son&#39;s marks were looking really very good, we decided on a nice local restaurant with Norwegian specialities. He chose the slow-cooked pork knuckle, which was crispy on the outside and like butter on the inside. Apparently - I don&#39;t eat meat, so took his word for it.<a href="/assets/image_957245.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Pig knuckle" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_957245.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Pig knuckle" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>The following morning we met Zach Kron for breakfast and then headed into the office for the official kick-off of the Forma Hackathon.<a href="/assets/image_942530.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Welcome snacks" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_942530.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Welcome snacks" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Daniel was the master-of-ceremonies, welcoming everyone.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_398988.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Daniel" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_398988.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Daniel" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Zach gave an inspirational speech (which was apparently half speech, half fever dream, as he’d just recovered from a bout of illness) to get folks in the mood.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_344105.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Zach" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_344105.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Zach" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Håvard helped form teams and get people to pitch their projects.<a href="/assets/image_248995.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Håvard" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_248995.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Håvard" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>I was very happy to catch up with old friends from the Developer Advocacy and Support team, Denis and Petr.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_893551.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Denis and Petr" border="0" height="500" src="/assets/image_893551.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Denis and Petr" width="375" /></a></p>
<p>Lunches were downstairs in the canteen.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_516926.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Lunch" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_516926.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Lunch" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Part of me was a little sad not to have time to explore Oslo, but my son spent many hours wandering through the snowy (and often treacherously slippery) streets.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_604103.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="The outside world" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_604103.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="The outside world" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>The Tuesday evening was spent hacking...</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_80129.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Evening hacking" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_80129.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Evening hacking" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>… with pizza.<a href="/assets/image_119529.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Pizza" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_119529.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Pizza" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Walking back, I did wonder how these scooters perform in the depths of a Norwegian winter, but decided not to find out.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_62449.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="No way" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_62449.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="No way" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>After a few more hours of hacking in the hotel room, I went to the hotel sauna for the last half hour. I had it to myself, but it’s clear people had been making the most of it. This particular scene reminded me of a mid-winter sauna in the Swedish city of Borås, back in the day. If we ever have a drink together, be sure to ask for the story about the Swedish fireman convention. Good times.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_425090.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Pre or post sauna" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_425090.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Pre or post sauna" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Aside from the hacking, there has been lots of chance to chat about technology - especially Forma, of course.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_145360.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Chats" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_145360.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Chats" width="500" /></a></p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_789934.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Hacks" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_789934.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Hacks" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>At 4pm it was time for the various teams to present. It was a very interesting session, as there was a really nice mix of “pure” Hackathon teams - made up of people coming together on the day - and companies who have sent their own teams to work on specific features they wanted to develop (more like our classic Accelerator model).</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_540742.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="The team presentations" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_540742.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="The team presentations" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>The jury - sat to the left of this photo - assessed the various team projects.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_724604.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="The jury watching the presentations" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_724604.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="The jury watching the presentations" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>The first team integrated Forma with Rhino Grasshopper.<a href="/assets/image_266936.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Team Formicae" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_266936.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Team Formicae" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>I presented my progress from the weekend, showing how views from inside the building could be assessed using VASA inside Forma.<a href="/assets/image_309867.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Demoing extensions to VASA inside Forma" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_309867.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Demoing extensions to VASA inside Forma" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>The next team had integrated AI into Forma to create geometry via a text interface.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_316173.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Integrating AI into Forma" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_316173.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Integrating AI into Forma" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>The next team focused on views onto a building using raycasting.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_828718.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Views onto objects" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_828718.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Views onto objects" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>My old friends from France, Alex and Charles Piro, presented their Augmented Reality integration with Forma.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_610745.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Les freres Piro" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_610745.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Les freres Piro" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>More friends from Greece - the PLEX-Earth team - had explored sourcing field data such as photos inside Forma.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_390706.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="PLEX Instant Photo" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_390706.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="PLEX Instant Photo" width="500" /></a><a href="/assets/image_308416.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="The whole room" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_308416.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="The whole room" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Saleem worked on analyzing satellite imagery to automagically integrate trees into Forma.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_34688.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Satellite trees in Forma" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_34688.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Satellite trees in Forma" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>The penultimate team was from Focus Software - an Autodesk reseller - who created an importer to bring geometry from GML into Forma. They also integrated Forma with AutoCAD!</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_629439.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Forma and AutoCAD" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_629439.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Forma and AutoCAD" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Last but by no means least was from Goldbeck, who integrated their car park configurator into Forma.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_703668.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Goldbeck s car park configuration" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_703668.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Goldbeck&#39;s car park configuration" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>While the judges deliberated, it was time for… more pizza!</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_493818.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="More Pizza" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_493818.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="More Pizza" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>And the winners were… the Piro brothers for their AR integration, Saleem for his Satellite Trees work and Team Formicae for their Rhino integration. Congratulations to all!</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_844525.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Saleem being congratulated" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_844525.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Saleem being congratulated" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>I was really impressed by everything the various teams were able to create during the all-too-short 2 days. (I think a 2-day Hackathon is a bit like a 45-minute flight that never reaches cruising altitude: by the time you’ve taken off it’s time to start the descent. ;-)</p>
<p>And congratulations also to the organizers - and the Forma staff who supported - for all their hard work, especially to Håvard and Daniel. I hope I get to attend another of these in the near future!</p>
