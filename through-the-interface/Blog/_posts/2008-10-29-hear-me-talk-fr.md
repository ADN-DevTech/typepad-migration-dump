<p>I've been meaning to do something like this for a while, ever since I bought a <a href="http://www.theflip.com/">Flip video camera</a>, back in July. Here's a (nearly) 10 minute segment where I talk a little bit about myself.</p><center><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/6PlAX5G-OgE&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1" width="425" height="344" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></center><p>If you found this interesting (or boring and irrelevant) please say so in a comment. Be sure to let me know if there are further topics you'd like to hear me talk about.</p>
