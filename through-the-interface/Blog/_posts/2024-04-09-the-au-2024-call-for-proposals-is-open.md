<p>It’s that time of year again: the Call for Proposals (CFP) for Autodesk University 2024 <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/autodesk-university/conference/call-for-proposals">opened on April 2nd</a> and will stay open until the end of the month (April 30th, 11:59 PM Pacific Time, to be precise).</p>

<p>I’ll be proposing at least one class, all being well, with the hope of getting to travel to San Diego from October 15th-17th for this year’s event. It’d be interesting to see AU in a new city. Fingers crossed!</p>
<p>If you’re a software developer who is thinking about submitting a proposal, then I recommend checking out <a href="https://aps.autodesk.com/blog/call-proposals-autodesk-university-2024">this post on the Autodesk Platform Services blog</a>. It contains some really helpful pointers about the topics of interest as well as some playlists that will inspire (and even educate) you. One of my classes from last year is on <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/autodesk-university/playlist#playlistid=8b3e9e75-c0cb-4c8c-b415-42849d86cf99">the Digital Twins playlist</a>, for instance. There’s some great content in these playlists (apart from this one class ;-). Be sure to check them out, whether you plan to submit a class proposal or not.</p>
