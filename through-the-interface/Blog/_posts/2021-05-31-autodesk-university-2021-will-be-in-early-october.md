<p>The big news of the last week or so – although I’m well behind the curve, given prior announcements by the <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/autodesk-university/blog/Join-Us-October-AU-2021-2021" target="_blank">AU</a> and <a href="https://forge.autodesk.com/blog/au-2021-dates-and-pricing" target="_blank">Forge</a> teams – is that the dates for <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/autodesk-university/conference/overview" target="_blank">Autodesk University 2021</a> have been fixed, and announced along with the event’s pricing.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2026bded550f0200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="186" title="AU2021 Save the Date" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="AU2021 Save the Date" src="/assets/image_840997.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>As anticipated from the <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2021/04/the-last-week-to-submit-your-au-2021-class-proposal.html" target="_blank">somewhat early CFP process</a>, this year’s AU will be held in early October. It wasn’t so long ago that AU was in December, so this is a significant shift for many – and will mean that speakers are likely to have to spend some time this summer getting their material together, given the time required to do so plus the delay for recording, posting, etc. Heads-up, fellow AU speakers!</p><p>Here are the dates, as already shared in the aforementioned blog posts:</p><ul><li><strong>October 5–7 | Americas</strong></li><li><strong>October 6–8 | EMEA and India</strong></li><li><strong>October 13–14 | APAC and Japan</strong></li></ul><p>And the pricing? I’m happy to see that once again it’s completely <strong>free</strong> to attend, just as it was for AU 2020.</p><p>I hope I’ll get to present some of the work we’ve been doing inside <a href="https://dasher360.com" target="_blank">Dasher</a> to integrate <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2021/05/its-officially-available-data-visualization-extension-for-the-forge-viewer.html" target="_blank">Hyperion</a> (the Forge viewer’s Data Visualization Extension). I already feel that I have more than enough content to fill an AU session, and have quite a bit more to work through between now and the summer. One way or another there will be some helpful knowledge to share, whether via an AU class or further posts on this blog. Let’s see!</p>
