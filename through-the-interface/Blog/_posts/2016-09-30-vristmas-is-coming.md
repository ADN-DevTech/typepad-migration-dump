<p>At Autodesk we’re in the process of equipping a number of our offices around the world with high-end VR showrooms. San Francisco and Boston are already set-up with a number of others currently in progress. It seems likely that Autodesk Neuchatel is going to be one of the next ones to come online, which is a source of great excitement to me, at least.</p> <p>As part of that effort, we’ve placed orders for two <a href="http://www.silverdraft.com/demon" target="_blank">Silverdraft Demon</a> systems as well as two <a href="https://www.vive.com/us/enterprise" target="_blank">HTC Vive Business Editions</a>. The first Vive arrived yesterday:</p> <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201bb093d0e69970d-pi" target="_blank"><img title="Trying out the fit of the HTC Vive" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 30px auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="Trying out the fit of the HTC Vive" src="/assets/image_367548.jpg" width="500" height="281"></a></p> <p>If you were at the Forge DevCon, you’ll already have seen the kind of system we’re going to have in place here. Here’s a photo of Merten in front of the VR set-up we had at the DevCon: we’ll soon have a nearly identical set-up in the Neuchatel office.</p> <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b7c8999bb2970b-pi" target="_blank"><img title="Merten in the Metaverse" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 30px auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="Merten in the Metaverse" src="/assets/image_262613.jpg" width="500" height="281"></a></p> <p>I’ve been working with our local facilities team, and we’ve identified a nice location on our 1st floor, not far from <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2015/10/autodesk-neuchatel-gets-a-new-shared-space.html" target="_blank">our new coffee area</a>.</p> <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b8d2237210970c-pi" target="_blank"><img title="Our prospective VR area" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 30px auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="Our prospective VR area" src="/assets/image_105296.jpg" width="500" height="281"></a></p> <p>I’m looking forward to being able to give demos… </p> <ul> <li>Collaborative design review using Autodesk VRED  <li>Using Autodesk LIVE to take Revit models into VR  <li>The WebVR-enabled Forge Viewer</li></ul> <p>The second two are works in progress (although one of them is literally coming “any day now”), but the first is very much working today. Here’s a video showing it in action:</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p align="center"><iframe height="281" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8aCPgWggwH4?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" width="500" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
