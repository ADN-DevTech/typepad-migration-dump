<p>For <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2020/10/au-2020-material-is-in-the-bag-a-few-upcoming-talks.html" target="_blank">this week’s talk for 10,000 codeurs</a>, my friend Jaime Rosales kindly put together some great slides that give a really succinct introduction to the Forge platform, including a number of helpful links to various online resources.</p>
<p>I made a few edits to make sure people could use the links in the exported PDF along with a few cosmetic tweaks, but otherwise the content is all Jaime’s.</p><p>At some point I may take the time to convert the content into native web elements (there are some cool animated GIFs for the various demos, for instance), but in the meantime here’s <a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/files/Getting%20started%20with%20Forge.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the PDF for you to download</a>, and here it is embedded in this post:</p><p><br></p>
