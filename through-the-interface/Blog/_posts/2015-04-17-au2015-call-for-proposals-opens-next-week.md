It will remain open until <strong>May 26th</strong>. I have a few ideas for possible topics to present at this year’s event…</p>  <ul>   <li>Virtual Reality using Autodesk’s View &amp; Data API </li>    <li>Developing JavaScript applications for AutoCAD using TypeScript </li>    <li>Processing drawings in the cloud using AutoCAD I/O </li> </ul>  <p>They all seem to be valid topics, but we’ll see if I can find the energy and motivation to submit all three. If you have an opinion on what you’d like to hear me talk about – even if you don’t expect to attend the event… any topic I cover will inevitably lead to multiple, related blog posts :-) – then please do post a comment.</p>  <p>I’ve heard from a few of you who are considering submitting proposals for this year’s AU. Please do! It’s a great way to increase your visibility within the Autodesk community and to expand your network. And it’s just plain fun. :-)</p>  <p>Looking forward to seeing you later in the year in Las Vegas!</p>
