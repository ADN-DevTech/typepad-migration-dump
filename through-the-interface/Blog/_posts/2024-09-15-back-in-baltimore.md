<p>I mentioned <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2024/08/transitioning-from-summer-mode.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">last time</a> that I was going to be busy preparing and delivering a number of presentations. I’m happy to say that crazy period has mostly come to a close. It was marked on Friday with the recording of <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2024/08/sign-up-for-au2024-classes-today-here-are-some-suggestions.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the Autodesk University 2024 class</a> that Håvard Høiby and I will be delivering again soon in San Diego.</p>
<p>It was a lot of fun preparing and delivering this class with Håvard, I must say. And I think people are going to really engage with the content (especially the information about Forma’s extension framework and SDK). Be sure to check it out once it’s available, whether virtually or in-person at AU.</p>

<p>This weekend I headed across to Dulles airport on my way to Toronto for some internal meetings with my research team.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_219932.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_219932.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Boarding" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>I managed to get lucky with my seat, for once: I snagged one with fantastic legroom, although I did get knocked by the meal service whenever it came by.<a href="/assets/image_224812.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" height="500" src="/assets/image_224812.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Legroom" width="375" /></a></p>
<p>Flying via DC meant taking Swiss from Zurich and then onwards with United from DC to Toronto, which luckily side-stepped the potential disruptions to Air Canada flights due to the pilots union salary negotiations stalling. Since flying over my friend and colleague, Tomas Lay Herrera, told me Air Canada had notified him of the negotiations succeeding, so both his flights and my return at the end of the week should go ahead as scheduled.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_420452.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Air Canada notification." border="0" height="500" src="/assets/image_420452.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Air Canada notification" width="375" /></a></p>
<p>I made the hop via DC so I could hang out with my son for a couple of days in Baltimore, which breaks up the journey nicely: if I’m going to adjust to the timezone it might as well be with him.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_229341.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="View from the halls." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_229341.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="View from the halls" width="500" /></a>My son is busy preparing for an exam this week, so I decided to get out of his way and head across the road to the Johns Hopkins Homewood campus to walk around.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_420468.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="It&#39;s a sign." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_420468.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="It&#39;s a sign" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>The weather is lovely here, right now: it’s still very warm but you get the first hints of autumn crispness in the air.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_981705.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" height="500" src="/assets/image_981705.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="The campus" width="375" /></a></p>
<p>One of my favorite things on the campus is to climb to the top of the bleachers and watch whatever sports team is training.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_405215.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_405215.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Football" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Despite his studies, he still needs to eat. We headed to Captain James’ Crab Shack down by the harbour to eat a half dozen chili crabs for lunch. Yum.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_974320.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_974320.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Crabs" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>They were so good.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_163549.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="A half dozen." border="0" height="375" src="/assets/image_163549.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="A half dozen" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>If a bit messy.</p>

I’ll be sure to post from there, as I have no doubt it’s going to be a really interesting few days.</p>
