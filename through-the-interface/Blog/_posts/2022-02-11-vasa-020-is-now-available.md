<p>Rhys Goldstein has been busy implementing some new features in the Voxel-based Architectural Space Analysis (VASA) package.</p><p>I’ve just published a new version to the Dynamo Package Manager containing the following enhancements:</p><ul><li><p>Added "PathModel.GenerateSamplePoints" and "DistanceField.GenerateSamplePoints", which generate sample points according to an approximate spacing parameter.</p><li><p>Added proximity operations ("NearestFilledAlongX", "NearestFilledAlongY", "NearestFilledAlongZ", and "NearestFilledHorizontally"), which find the filled voxel nearest to a point.</p><li><p>Added special operations ("AutoCrop", "AutoSplit", "DensityMap", "DensityMapWithWeights"), which automatically crop, split, and create density maps from voxel models.</p><li><p>Added new examples ("11-VASA-Path-Density.dyn" and "12-VASA-Sensor-Coverage.dyn"), which demonstrate the new features.</p><li><p>Fixed a bug in the fill from point operation, which previously failed to fill an empty region in rare cases.</p><li><p>Fixed a bug in the union operation, which previously hung if passed an empty list.</p></li></ul><p>The best way to check out what’s new is to load the above-mentioned sample files. The first covers path density – something that is extremely valuable for Generative Design workflows, such as the one implemented for <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/research/projects/project-discover" target="_blank">Project Discover</a>.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202942f9887e0200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="280" title="Path density sample in Dynamo 2.13" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Path density sample in Dynamo 2.13" src="/assets/image_868923.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Here’s an animation of the graph’s graphical output:</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202942f9887b1200c-pi"><img width="500" height="280" title="Path density sample" style="margin: 30px auto; float: none; display: block;" alt="Path density sample" src="/assets/image_819849.jpg"></a></p><p>The second is also one I can well imagine making use of, in the future, for IoT-centric projects: it allows you to calculate and display the coverage of sensors in a building.</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202942f9887d3200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="280" title="Sensor coverage sample in Dynamo 2.13" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Sensor coverage sample in Dynamo 2.13" src="/assets/image_584827.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>Here it is moving:</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20278806ad1a8200d-pi"><img width="500" height="281" title="Sensor coverage" style="margin: 30px auto; float: none; display: block;" alt="Sensor coverage" src="/assets/image_522195.jpg"></a></p><p>This is actually more involved than it might look: the sample isn’t just displaying the sensor coverage graphically, VASA is also providing sample points within the space that get used for the sensor locations:</p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202942f988822200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="281" title="Showing the sample sensor locations" style="margin: 30px auto; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Showing the sample sensor locations" src="/assets/image_390678.jpg" border="0"></a><p>This is exactly the kind of capability that we had to implement with significant complexity – using the centroid of Voronoi cells – to create neighbourhoods in the MaRS project. This is going to be very useful for various generative workflows, I’m sure!</p><p>I’m going to leave it there for now, but this is something I’d like to dig into in more detail in a future post. I’m sure Rhys will soon be recording another of his great videos to discuss this soon, in any case.</p>
