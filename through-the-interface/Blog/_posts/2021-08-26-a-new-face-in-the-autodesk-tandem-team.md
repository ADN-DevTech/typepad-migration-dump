<p>My friend and colleague Hali Larsen has joined the Autodesk Tandem team as a Product Manager focused on connected workflows and sustainability. This is <u>huge</u> news, for lots of reasons: for several years Hali played an absolutely instrumental role in <a href="https://dasher360.com" target="_blank">Project Dasher</a> – in many ways she was our de facto PM, but also worked through many gnarly issues related to bespoke configuration for various Dasher pilot projects. Hali has a wealth of experience working with customers in this space, and also knows where most of Dasher’s skeletons are buried, so she is <em>the</em> right person to take on this role, in my opinion. I have no doubt that Tandem – as a product and a platform – will benefit hugely from Hali’s involvement. </p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20282e11c0e5a200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="465" title="Hali joins Tandem" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Hali joins Tandem" src="/assets/image_70056.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>While I would have loved to continue working with Hali on Dasher, her taking this next step is exactly the right thing to have happen for our project, too. We’ll be continuing to research the use of Forge – and, indeed Tandem – to develop connected digital twins, but it’s time to take many of the learnings we’ve made, over the last 5 years of working with Forge (and 11 years, if you count the learnings from when we had a desktop client), and have them influence the direction of Tandem. Our AEC customers will be using Tandem to build and manage digital twins, and with Hali’s help these twins will increasingly integrate sensor data to connect to real-world performance. Exciting times!</p>
