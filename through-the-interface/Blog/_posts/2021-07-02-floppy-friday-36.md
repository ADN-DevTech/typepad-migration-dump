<p>In <a href="https://youtu.be/_2ByhPP7lwc" rel="noopener" target="_blank">this week’s episode</a> we take a look at three more Commodore 64 games loaded from a random floppy disk I found amongst the collection. The first, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_Manager_(1982_video_game)" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Football Manager</a>, is a stone-cold classic. Not the most visually interesting of games, but one that enthralled a generation.</p>
<p>The next two are on the stranger side. There’s <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/c64/hunchback-at-the-olympics" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Hunchback at the Olympics</a> – which is a <a href="https://genesistemple.com/quirky-weird-c64-hunchback-at-the-olympics" rel="noopener" target="_blank">very, very quirky</a> sequel in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunchback_(video_game)" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Hunchback</a> series – and then there’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocketball" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Rocketball</a>, which I’ve now found out was based on the movie Rollerball. It was set in 2010, so it’s another of those “where’s my hoverboard?” moments. It turns out <a href="https://genesistemple.com/quirky-weird-c64-rocket-ball" rel="noopener" target="_blank">you need to crouch down and pick up the ball</a>, which is the key piece of knowledge I was missing to play this game.</p>
<p>Here’s the episode:</p>

<p>The only one of these games that fell in the Zzap!64 years was the Hunchback one, and <a href="http://www.zzap64.co.uk/cgi-bin/displaypage.pl?issue=003&amp;page=032&amp;thumbstart=0&amp;magazine=zzap" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the review</a> was harsh (but very fair):</p>

<p>That’s it for this week. I’ll be pre-recording next week’s episode – as I’m travelling for most of the week – so there will be one as usual on Friday morning.</p>
