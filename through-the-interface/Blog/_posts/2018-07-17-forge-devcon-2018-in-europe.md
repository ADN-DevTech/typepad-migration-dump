<p>The Forge DevCon is coming back to Europe, specifically to Darmstadt, Germany (on October 16) ahead of AU Germany (on October 17-18). While the content for AU Germany is presented in the local language, everything at the Forge DevCon will be in English. And it’s free to attend!</p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2022ad35bcae4200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="250" title="Forge DevCon Europe" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Forge DevCon Europe" src="/assets/image_925590.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p><a href="https://www.rayseven.com/r7/runtime/autodesk/devcon2018/registration.visitor.php?l=en&amp;s=welcome" target="_blank">Registration is now open for the event</a>.
