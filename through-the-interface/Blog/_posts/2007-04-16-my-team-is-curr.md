<p>My team is currently working on a proposal to deliver a significant number of additional API- &amp; customization-related classes at this year’s <a href="http://www.autodesk.com/au">Autodesk University</a>. We’re planning to hold sessions covering many of our products’ APIs, including (hopefully):</p>

<ul><li>Platform products &amp; technologies<ul><li>AutoCAD</li>

<li>Component Technologies (RealDWG, AutoCAD OEM, DWG TrueView, DWF Toolkit, Design Review, Freewheel)</li></ul></li>

<li>AEC<ul><li>Revit Architecture</li>

<li>Revit Structure</li>

<li>Revit MEP</li>

<li>AutoCAD Architecture</li>

<li>AutoCAD MEP</li>

<li>AutoCAD Civil 3D</li></ul></li>

<li>Manufacturing<ul><li>Inventor</li>

<li>AutoCAD Mechanical</li>

<li>AutoCAD Electrical</li>

<li>Productstream</li></ul></li>

<li>Geospatial<ul><li>AutoCAD Map 3D</li>

<li>Topobase</li>

<li>MapGuide Enterprise</li></ul></li>

<li>Media &amp; Entertainment<ul><li>Maya</li>

<li>3ds Max</li>

<li>MotionBuilder</li></ul></li></ul>

<p>Here are the some of the sessions we’re thinking about for AutoCAD, for instance:</p>

<ul><li>API Comparison Seminar</li>

<li>Using the ObjectARX Wizard</li>

<li>.NET for LISP programmers</li>

<li>AutoCAD .NET in one day</li>

<li>Storing additional data in a DWG</li>

<li>Custom objects master-class</li>

<li>Exposing objects through COM and .NET</li>

<li>Writing an installer</li></ul>

<p>It’d be great to get feedback from this blog’s readership (especially those of you thinking about attending AU 2007) on what sort of material you’d like to see my team present: which products and topics. I can’t promise we’ll be able to cover every suggestion that’s made (of course), but I would certainly value your input. We’re finalising our proposal in the next few weeks, so please let me know any feedback or suggestions as soon as possible via comments to this blog or personal email.</p>
