<p>Just a quick note to say that you can now <strike>log in to the Autodesk University website</strike> <em>(this guidance has changed, please see below)</em> from today – June 23rd – to see the status of your class proposals and learn whether or not they were accepted for AU 2023 in Las Vegas.</p><p>I was very happy to learn that the two proposals I submitted this year were accepted:</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202c1b2576b6a200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="290" title="AU 2023 class proposals" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="AU 2023 class proposals" src="/assets/image_816124.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>I’m sure there’ll be an email sent very shortly, but I just thought I’d share this in case anyone’s impatient to find out their situation relative to classes at this year’s event.</p><p>Hoping to see you in Las Vegas!</p><p><strong><em>Update:</em></strong></p><p>The AU website is currently experiencing some issues, so submitters will soon be notified by email about the status of their class proposals.
