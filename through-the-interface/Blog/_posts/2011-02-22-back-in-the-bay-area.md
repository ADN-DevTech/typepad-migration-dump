<p>Earlier today, while transiting between flights from Geneva to San Francisco in Heathrow, I overheard one security agent describing the perfect “pat down” to a colleague:</p>  <blockquote>   <p><em>“You need to get them to hold their arms out wide. Not like that lady who kept her elbows by her sides, with her hands flapping around like one of those raptures [sic.] from Jurassic Park.”</em></p> </blockquote>  <p>I’ll be travelling over the next week or so, between San Francisco, San Rafael and Las Vegas. I’ll be posting on more technical topics, when I have time, but thought I’d share that little travel anecdote, in the meantime. :-)</p>
