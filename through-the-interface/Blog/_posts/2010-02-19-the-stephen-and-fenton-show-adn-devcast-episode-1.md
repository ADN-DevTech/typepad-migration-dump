<p>You may or may not be aware that my team, <em><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2006/06/introduction_to_1.html">DevTech</a></em>, writes and publishes <em>DevNotes</em> on the ADN website, answers support questions submitted by ADN members using a tool we call <em>DevHelp Online</em>, records <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/devtv/"><em>DevTV</em></a><em> </em>sessions, participates in events known as <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2009/04/introducing-devlabs.html"><em>DevLabs</em></a>, talks about our upcoming products at <em>DevDays </em>and delivers <a href="http://autodesk.com/apitraining">API training</a>. (Seems like we need to get the branding police to work on that last one. :-)</p>
<p>So, in keeping with our theme we have started a new activity…</p>
<p>I’m proud (and not unamused, which is putting it mildly) to announce our first <em>DevCast</em>. Recorded recently by Stephen Preston and Fenton Webb from DevTech Americas (and yes, like me they both hail from the UK, as you will most likely be able to tell from their accents), this DevCast talks about some useful programming tips (such as using smart pointers in ObjectARX), some handy development tools (such as ArxDbg, MgdDbg and Inspector) and includes some live footage taken at the recent DevLab held in San Francisco, showing off some interesting work being done by developers working with AutoCAD.</p>
<p>It’s around 45 minutes in length, which is perhaps a touch long for a classic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast">podcast</a>, but there’s a lot of great stuff in there: even with my admittedly shrinking attention span I sat through the entire show in one sitting.</p>
<p>A quick side comment… in case you’re unfamiliar with Stephen’s legendarily <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadpan">dry sense of humour</a>, I need to point out that Stephen and Fenton were not being entirely sincere in their comments about me (I’m really not that good at football, for instance ;-).</p>
<p>Anyway, enough with the introduction. Sit back and enjoy our first ADN DevCast, and be sure to let us know whether you like it and whether you have suggestions for future episodes.</p>

<p>As mentioned earlier, there are some handy tools used in this episode:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>ArxDbg</strong> - a tool I talk about regularly that can be found on the ObjectARX SDK (for those who don&#39;t have the tools to compile C++ projects, here&#39;s <span class="asset asset-generic at-xid-6a00d83452464869e20120a8b10cc6970b"><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/files/arxdbg_2010.zip">a pre-built version of the .ARX for AutoCAD 2010</a>).</span> 
<li><strong>MgdDbg</strong> - a .NET application comparable to ArxDbg which can be found <a href="http://adn.autodesk.com/adn/servlet/item?siteID=4814862&amp;id=12990239&amp;linkID=4900524">on the ADN site</a> (for those of you without ADN access, here&#39;s <span class="asset asset-generic at-xid-6a00d83452464869e2012877b3dab1970c"><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/files/mgddbg_2010.zip">the .DLL and its accompanying source project&#0160;for AutoCAD 2010</a></span>). 
<li><strong>Inspector</strong> - a tool that has been extremely popular since its mention in the <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2007/11/devtv-introduct.html">Introduction to AutoCAD .NET Programming</a> DevTV session. Here are versions of this tool&#0160;<span class="asset asset-generic at-xid-6a00d83452464869e2012877b3e173970c"><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/files/inspector_2007-9.zip">for AutoCAD 2007-2009</a></span> and&#0160;<span class="asset asset-generic at-xid-6a00d83452464869e20120a8b11810970b"><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/files/inspector_2010.zip">for AutoCAD 2010</a></span> with their respective C++ source projects. </li>
</li></li></ul>
<p>All of these tools are provided &quot;as is&quot;, bugs included.</p>
