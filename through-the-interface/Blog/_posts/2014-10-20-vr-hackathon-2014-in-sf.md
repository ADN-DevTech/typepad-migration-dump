<p>It’s been a busy few days. After being in full-day meetings on Thursday and Friday, I headed down with Jim Quanci to the <a href="http://vrhackathon.com" target="_blank">VR Hackathon</a>’s kick-off event on Friday night. It was held at the newly refurbished Gray Area Theater in San Francisco’s Mission district.</p>  <p>The Friday night “mega meetup” was a great way to kick the event off, with presentations from <a href="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov" target="_blank">NASA’s JPL</a> on how they teamed up with Sony to develop a prototype VR system to control robots for asteroid mining.</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b8d0808d56970c-pi" target="_blank"><img title="Asteroid mining" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 20px auto; border-left: 0px; display: block; padding-right: 0px" border="0" alt="Asteroid mining" src="/assets/image_8266.jpg" width="394" height="223" /></a></p>  <p>There was also an interesting presentation on the evolution of VR tech from <a href="https://www.leapmotion.com" target="_blank">Leap Motion</a>’s founder and CTO, David Holz.</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201bb079bacc1970d-pi" target="_blank"><img title="David Holz from Leap Motion" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 20px auto; border-left: 0px; display: block; padding-right: 0px" border="0" alt="David Holz from Leap Motion" src="/assets/image_366022.jpg" width="394" height="223" /></a></p>    <p>Jim and I set up a table – as Autodesk sponsored the event – and over the course of the weekend talked to various people about the Autodesk Viewing &amp; Data API (and about our products and APIs, in general).</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b7c6f685c5970b-pi" target="_blank"><img title="Jim talking 3D" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 20px auto; border-left: 0px; display: block; padding-right: 0px" border="0" alt="Jim talking 3D" src="/assets/image_572529.jpg" width="394" height="223" /></a></p>  <p>To help demo the stereoscopic viewer – and to attract people to ask us to check it out – I had some fun putting together a version that auto-orbits and explodes the contents (once fully loaded). <a href="http://safe-reef-1847.herokuapp.com/stereo-explode.html" target="_blank">This version</a> is best viewed in a browser, of course, as it doesn’t respond to device tilt. </p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b7c6f685ce970b-pi" target="_blank"><img title="Our DODOcase and PCs on the last day" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 20px auto; border-left: 0px; display: block; padding-right: 0px" border="0" alt="Our DODOcase and PCs on the last day" src="/assets/image_858334.jpg" width="394" height="223" /></a></p>  <p>I wasn’t sure whether I’d end up participating in a team, or not, but I ended up having so much fun hanging out with Jim and chatting to people that I stuck with that.</p>  <p>There were lots of fun things going on with the various teams…</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201bb079bacde970d-pi" target="_blank"><img title="Lots of medically oriented devices" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 20px auto; border-left: 0px; display: block; padding-right: 0px" border="0" alt="Lots of medically oriented devices" src="/assets/image_192009.jpg" width="394" height="223" /></a></p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b7c6f685e2970b-pi" target="_blank"><img title="A team working with Google Cardboard" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 20px auto; border-left: 0px; display: block; padding-right: 0px" border="0" alt="A team working with Google Cardboard" src="/assets/image_647300.jpg" width="394" height="223" /></a></p>  <p>There were even a few Autodeskers present. Lars Schneider – a member of the Infraworks team in Potsdam, Germany – formed a team with Torsten Becker, a friend of his who was also visiting SF. They’re pictured here with Michael Beale, who has worked on our web-based viewing technology and is currently on the rendering-as-a-service team.</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201bb079bacea970d-pi" target="_blank"><img title="Michael, Torsten and Lars" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 20px auto; border-left: 0px; display: block; padding-right: 0px" border="0" alt="Michael, Torsten and Lars" src="/assets/image_481531.jpg" width="394" height="223" /></a></p>  <p>Aside from answering questions and giving demos, I also spent some time checking out the other sponsor’s technology. Sony’s asteroid mining tech was neat:</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b8d0808d82970c-pi" target="_blank"><img title="Kean in Morpheus" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 20px auto; border-left: 0px; display: block; padding-right: 0px" border="0" alt="Kean in Morpheus" src="/assets/image_952951.jpg" width="165" height="240" /></a></p>  <p>As was the combination of Leap Motion with Oculus Rift:<a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b8d0808d91970c-pi" target="_blank"><img title="Leap and Oculus" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 20px auto; border-left: 0px; display: block; padding-right: 0px" border="0" alt="Leap and Oculus" src="/assets/image_649595.jpg" width="394" height="223" /></a></p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201bb079bacfe970d-pi" target="_blank"><img title="Leap Motion&#39;s Oculus Rift demo - keeping balls in the air" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 20px auto; border-left: 0px; display: block; padding-right: 0px" border="0" alt="Leap Motion&#39;s Oculus Rift demo - keeping balls in the air" src="/assets/image_215024.jpg" width="394" height="223" /></a></p>              <p>Aside from seeing Leap Motion with Oculus Rift, at least one team was using an alpha version of the Android SDK to provide input into a Google Cardboard-based game. Something I intend to do myself, once I manage to get a phone that supports the SDK.</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201b7c6f68603970b-pi" target="_blank"><img title="Someone using Google Cardboard with Leap Motion via the Android SDK" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 20px auto; border-left: 0px; display: block; padding-right: 0px" border="0" alt="Someone using Google Cardboard with Leap Motion via the Android SDK" src="/assets/image_796703.jpg" width="394" height="223" /></a></p>  <p>Sunday afternoon was all about judging. A number of the more tethered solutions were judged by a roving panel of expert judges…</p>  <p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201bb079bad1a970d-pi" target="_blank"><img title="Judges judging" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 20px auto; border-left: 0px; display: block; padding-right: 0px" border="0" alt="Judges judging" src="/assets/image_906218.jpg" width="394" height="223" /></a></p>  <p align="left">… but several others ended up being presented on the main stage. Here’s a section of a video of Lars &amp; Torsten’s Oculus Rift + Leap Motion app that I’m very happy to say ended up winning the WebVR category. </p>  <p align="left"><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e201bb079bad24970d-pi"><img title="Lars and Torsten&#39;s Hackathon demo" style="float: none; margin: 20px auto; display: block" alt="Lars and Torsten&#39;s Hackathon demo" src="/assets/image_900686.jpg" width="200" height="121" /></a></p>      <p align="left">(Lars tells me they’ll be posting the code soon – I’ll be sure to link to it here.)</p>  <p align="left">Way to go, guys – makes me feel good to see a fellow Autodesker doing so well at this event. :-)</p>  <p>Overall it was a great weekend. There were some really cool projects – such as a Leap Motion-based hand tremor detector, a procedurally-generated game world (which reminded me of <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2013/10/an-interview-with-ian-bell.html" target="_blank">Elite</a>) and a CAD-like tool that allows you to tweak the design of a lamp shade by tweaking the position of shadows on the wall. Awesome stuff.</p>  <p>Many thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/MetaverseOne" target="_blank">Damon Hernandez</a> and members of the Web 3D consortium for all the hard work. I hope I’ll be able to make it across to the next event!</p>
