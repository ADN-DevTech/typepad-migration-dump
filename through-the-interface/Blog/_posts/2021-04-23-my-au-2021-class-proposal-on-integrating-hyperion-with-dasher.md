<p>On Friday I went ahead and submitted my one and only class proposal for the all-digital Autodesk University 2021. Let’s hope it gets selected.</p><p>In case you’re interested, here’s the content of the proposal:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Title:</strong> Dasher and Hyperion: using Data Visualization in a Forge viewer application<p><strong>Class ID:</strong> SD500020<br><strong>Product(s):</strong> Forge<br><strong>Topics:</strong> Building Information Modeling (BIM), Building Operations, Internet of Things (IoT), Software Development<h4><font style="font-weight: bold;">Session Description</font></h4><p>Autodesk Research started Project Dasher in 2009 to explore the possibilities around integrating IoT data with BIM. In 2016 it was ported to work on the Forge platform, to understand the feasibility and potential for such a client application to work in the browser. This work eventually inspired Project Hyperion, which has been made available to Forge Viewer developers via the Data Visualization Extension.<p>While Dasher inspired Hyperion, work was needed to take this new public API and use it to replicate Dasher features. This session takes an in-depth look at this journey, exploring how Forge developers can harness the Data Visualization Extension from existing viewer applications.<h4><font style="font-weight: bold;">Learning Objectives</font></h4><ol><li>Know the history and features of Project Dasher
<li>Understand the origin and capabilities of Project Hyperion
<li>Integrate the Data Visualization Extension into an existing non-React web application
<li>Plan development activities based on Data Visualization features coming in the Forge viewer</li></ol></blockquote><p>If you’d like to see this as part of AU 2021, feel free to <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/autodesk-university/conference/proposal/Dasher-and-Hyperion-using-Data-Visualization-Forge-viewer-application" target="_blank">vote for it here</a> before <strong>May 12th</strong>. This is my last reminder that you still have <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2021/04/the-last-week-to-submit-your-au-2021-class-proposal.html" target="_blank">a few days left</a> to <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/autodesk-university/conference/call-for-proposals" target="_blank">submit your own proposals</a>, too!</p><p>Now, as I’ve submitted a class proposal about integrating Hyperion into Dasher, it seemed like an excellent time to start integrating Hyperion into Dasher. ;-)</p><p>The timing was great, as the Forge team have started a new virtual Accelerator today. Which means I can participate in the event as an Acceleree rather than an Accelerant, for once. That’s fun!</p><p>Over the weekend I got started on this, but largely with some house-keeping and prep work (I’ll talk more about this in some coming posts). I did manage to get some early success today with integrating sprites for displaying sensor dots in Dasher. Here’s a teaser screenshot:</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e202788025ef56200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="312" title="Hyperion sensor dots in Dasher" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Hyperion sensor dots in Dasher" src="/assets/image_535479.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>I’ll do my best to document this journey, to give a sense of what’s involved for people. Watch this space.</p>
