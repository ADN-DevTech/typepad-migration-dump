<p>Microsoft has released Visual Studio 2008 and the .NET Framework 3.5. For the announcement see <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/somasegar/archive/2007/11/19/visual-studio-2008-and-net-framework-3-5-shipped.aspx">Soma's blog</a> and for more detailed information see <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/11/19/visual-studio-2008-and-net-3-5-released.aspx">Scott Guthrie's</a>.</p>

<p>I haven't yet worked with this version of Visual Studio, but I'm told it installs side-by-side with previous versions of Visual Studio, so I'll be taking a look after AU.</p>

<p>Some of the areas I'm especially interested in - and this is not an exhaustive list of all the cool stuff the release includes... :-)</p>

<ul><li>C#/VB language features, many of which have come from the world of functional programming<ul><li>Automatic properties, extension methods, lambda expressions, object &amp; list initializers, etc. etc.</li></ul></li>

<li>Enhanced HTML/CSS editing<ul><li>I still hand-hack a fair amount of HTML</li></ul></li>

<li>LINQ - language integrated query<ul><li>Allows you to create/manage data(-base) queries via code rather than SQL</li></ul></li>

<li>Integrated browsing of the .NET Framework source</li></ul>

<p>As for AutoCAD development: there should not be a problem writing .NET applications for AutoCAD with Visual Studio 2008 - especially as it allows you to build applications for prior versions of the .NET Framework - but you should <strong>not</strong> attempt to build ObjectARX applications. The supported C++ compiler for ObjectARX in AutoCAD 2007 &amp; 2008 is Visual Studio 2005.</p>

<p>I'll be back on the subject of metaprogramming in my next post...</p>
