<p>I know I’m late to the party on this one - if you’re a software developer working in the Autodesk Platform Services ecosystem then you’ll by now already have heard the news and marked your calendar - but anyway: <a href="https://aps.autodesk.com/blog/autodesk-devcon-returns-2024">a number of Autodesk DevCon events were announced last week</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_203680.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Autodesk DevCon 2024" src="/assets/image_203680.jpg" alt="Autodesk DevCon 2024" width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>The flagship DevCon event is being held in Munich, Germany, from May 28-29, 2024. (This recognition that Europe is at the centre of the world is long overdue, just sayin’. ;-P)</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_100992.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Autodesk DevCon Munich 2024" src="/assets/image_100992.jpg" alt="Autodesk DevCon Munich 2024" width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>A satellite DevConX with more limited capacity is being held in Boston a few weeks beforehand, from May 14-15, along with further events in Asia/Pacific being held later on in July (I expect).</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_869405.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Autodesk DevCon 2024 Events" src="/assets/image_869405.jpg" alt="Autodesk DevCon 2024 events" width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>You can already register for the Boston and Munich events: in fact you should hurry up and do so, both to guarantee your spot (especially for Boston) and to take advantage of the early bird discount of $100/€100 for registering before March 31.</p>
<p>I’m almost certain that I’ll be at the main event in Munich: it worked very well <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2023/09/autodesk-devcon-2023-in-munich-part-1.html">last</a> <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2023/09/autodesk-devcon-2023-in-munich-part-2.html">time</a>, coming across by Flixbus and staying with a friend.</p>
<p>As I’ve managed to post nearly all the promotional images in a single post, here are a couple more to complete the set.</p>

<p>See you in Munich!</p>
