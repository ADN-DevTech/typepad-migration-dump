<p>As mentioned in <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2008/08/through-the-int.html">this recent post</a>, I've been meaning to create a master page of all the posts I've made since the blog was born in mid-2006. Well, <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/posts.html">here is that page</a>. Please check it out and let me know what you think. Once I get feedback on the page, I'll go ahead and add a link to it from one or other of the navigation sidebars.</p>

<p>I can also apply the type of view used on the page to the various category-/date-based archive pages, if people generally consider it to be more helpful than the current approach (which is for each archive to include the full content of each of the various posts). Again, let me know... :-)</p>
