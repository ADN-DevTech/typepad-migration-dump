<p>I came across this classic tome while wandering the halls of the Neuchatel office, this week. It’s one I remember reading when in my last year at University (in fact I’m almost certain I have a copy gathering dust in my basement).</p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20224e03dadc0200d-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="402" title="Bjarne Stroustrup's seminal programming book" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Bjarne Stroustrup's seminal programming book" src="/assets/image_828595.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>This particular volume once belonged to James Carrington (at least that’s my best guess from a Post-It on the inside that mentions his first name), who was an early member of the Developer Support team at the ESC (European Software Centre) in Neuchatel, way back when. This edition is from 1986, which I’m pretty sure makes it a reprint of the <a href="http://www.stroustrup.com/1st.html" target="_blank">1st edition</a>.</p><p>Anyway – if you don’t already have it and would like it, <a href="mailto:kean.walmsley@autodesk.com?subject=I want a book on C++" target="_blank">drop me an email</a>. You should know the drill, by now.</p><p>This week many of my esteemed Neuchatel colleagues are leaving the company, very sadly. The Localization and Finance teams have now almost gone, with a few people staying on until July or August. We’ve had regular “<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ap%C3%A9ro" target="_blank">apéros</a>” at the end of each month to say goodbye, but May is a month where a lot of people are leaving. The weather was nice yesterday for the May apéro, so at least we could share a glass of wine together outside:</p><p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e20224df36bf9f200b-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="243" title="Our May leavers apero" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Our May leavers apero" src="/assets/image_791185.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>I’m going to be travelling for the next month pretty much solidly, so will only be back in the office for the June apéro. Here are my travel plans:</p><ul><li>June 4-7, <a href="http://www.simaud.org/2018/" target="_blank">SimAUD 2018</a> (the Symposium on Simulation for Architecture + Urban Design) at TU Delft in the Netherlands</li><li>June 12-15, the <a href="http://autodeskcloudaccelerator.com" target="_blank">Forge Accelerator</a> in Barcelona</li><li>June 16-17, the <a href="https://youtu.be/G90CXQ1hAro" target="_blank">Autodesk Football Tournament</a> in Bordeaux</li><li>June 19-20, <a href="http://au.autodesk.com/london" target="_blank">Autodesk University in London</a></li></ul><p>This year’s football tournament is going to be the last one with a Neuchatel team, which will be very poignant. I’m looking forward to the event but it’s going to be tough knowing it’s the last one where we play together as a team.</p><p><strong><em>Update:</em></strong></p><p>The book will soon be on its way to Lisbon to Francisco Silva, its new&nbsp; owner. Congratulations, Francisco!</p>
