<p>Yesterday my two sons – who are now 6 and 4, both great ages – managed to get me to sit (several times, of course) on a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whoopee_cushion" target="_blank">whoopee cushion</a>. Which brought back many fond memories of my brother and I playing similar tricks at around that age. What amazed me most was how the technology has advanced: this latest generation of cushion <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Henbrandt-Self-Inflating-Whoopee-Cushion/dp/B00307RFQM" target="_blank">self-inflates</a>! A simple enough innovation – the rubber now contains a small hole and a sponge – but in many ways revolutionary. Ah, if only I had a time machine I could make a small (but very noisy) fortune. :-)</p>  <p>Anyway, enough about that. In today’s post I wanted to share a potentially useful resource that was brought to my attention by Augusto Gonçalves (thanks, Augusto! :-), the <a href="http://mwinapi.sourceforge.net" target="_blank">Managed Windows API</a>.</p>  <p>Here are excerpts from this site regarding the problem…</p>  <blockquote>   <p><em>If you want use Windows functionality in a .NET application which is not covered by the .NET framework (there is no &quot;managed API&quot; available for it), you usually have to use PInvoke, an interface that allows to invoke raw API functions from C# and VB.NET.</em></p> </blockquote>  <p>And the solution…</p>  <blockquote>   <p><em>&quot;Managed Windows API&quot; is a collection of C# components that wrap Windows API functionality. It contains those features the author needed for his C# development, but if you have components yourself you want to share, please submit them so that this project can grow.</em></p> </blockquote>  <p>Before going any further I should state that <strong>I haven’t actually tried using this myself</strong> – and so cannot comment on its capabilities or quality – but the concept is promising and it’s available with full source code.</p>  <p>If you have any experience with this layer – or take the time to look into – please do post a comment.</p>
