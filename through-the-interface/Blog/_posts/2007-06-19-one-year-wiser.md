<p>Well, would you believe it: <em>Through the Interface</em> was started exactly a year ago today.</p>

<p>I hope you've found this blog helpful over the past 12 months; I've certainly enjoyed sharing my (and above all, my team's) knowledge with you, and look forward to doing so for a long time to come. But please keep the post suggestions coming, as many of the best posts over the last year (in my opinion, at least) have originated from suggestions from this blog's readership.</p>

<p>By the way, for those of you who are interested: I'm now back from Beijing - we arrived in Switzerland a little over 2 weeks ago, having stopped by Bangalore for 2 weeks on the way home to spend time with the DevTech team there and catch up with friends and relatives. As you can imagine, 2+ months away (7 weeks in China, 2 weeks in India) was quite tough, even if we were all together as a family. We very often missed our home comforts, it has to be said, but the experience was certainly valuable.</p>

<p>Two days after getting back from the trip to China &amp; India, I had to head across to Munich for some internal meetings. This afternoon I'm heading to Boston for some more. But all being well I should have another technical post for you by the end of the week.</p>
