<p>For those of you who were unable to attend various <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2008/07/au-2008-class-s.html">Developer Track sessions</a> at this year's Autodesk University (or would just like a refresher for sessions you found useful), my team is beavering away at recording our various AU sessions as DevTV episodes.</p> <p>As a quick taste of how they'll (most likely) look, here's the first: Stephen Preston's popular "AutoCAD .NET Basics" session, which went by the session ID of DE205-4, this year. Here it is for <a href="http://download.autodesk.com/media/adn/AutoCAD_DotNet_Basics/AutoCAD_DotNet_Basics.html">view</a> and for <a href="http://download.autodesk.com/media/adn/AutoCAD_DotNet_Basics.zip">download</a> (139.1 Mb). It's possibly a slightly larger session to stream or download than you may have seen in the past from us as we're experimenting with a higher-quality publication format (feedback welcome).</p>
