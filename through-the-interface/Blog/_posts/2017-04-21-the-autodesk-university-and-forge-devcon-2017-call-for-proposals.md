The event is being held from November 14-16 in Las Vegas. Being accepted as a presenter is a great way to get exposure within the Autodesk community, as well as being a sure-fire way of attending the conference itself.</p> <p>Something that’s likely to be of interest to this blog’s readers: this year’s Forge DevCon is now sharing the same CFP process as AU2017 (as some of you may be aware, the DevCon has shifted from its original June date in SF to being held on the Monday before AU starts). So if you have a software development topic – ideally one that relates to the Forge platform – that you’d like to talk to people about, be sure to submit it via the AU2017 CFP site and answer “Forge DevCon” in response to the question “would you be willing to present your class during a Monday pre-conference event?”.</p> <p>From my side, I’m a little sad about the fact I won’t be submitting a proposal, this year, as during these dates I’m expecting to be somewhere in India during <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2017/03/flights-are-booked.html" target="_blank">my family’s upcoming round-the-world trip</a>. But I’m very much planning on being at AU2018. :-)</p>
