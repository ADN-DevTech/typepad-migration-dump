A perfect umbrella topic for a session on GD!</p><p>The event was originally going to be held in-person in Zurich, but with recent developments it became clear that it would have to be held online.</p><p><a href="https://sdsc-connect.ch/#register" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="349" title="SDSC-Connect" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="SDSC-Connect" src="/assets/image_72941.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>This is bad and good, of course: it’s bad because I won’t get to meet attendees in person – and they sound like a really interesting group of people – and it’s good because a) there’s no travel – even local rail travel – involved, b) more people can attend and c) it’s completely free to do so! This is very much the story of virtual conferences during this pandemic, of course.</p><p>Anyway, this session is going to be a little different for me: the original request was to present some information about Autodesk Research’s collaboration with Philippe Starck and Kartell to create the AI Chair – a project that was delivered by colleagues in research using technology with which I’m only cursorily familiar. So I’ve broadened the scope to cover four projects: two created using GD for Manufacturing – the AI Chair and the JPL Lander – and two using GD for AEC – the MaRS office and the Van Wijnen generative urban design project (both of which I know much more about).</p><p><a href="https://through-the-interface.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83452464869e2026bde972745200c-pi" target="_blank"><img width="500" height="260" title="Generative designs for SDSC-Connect" style="margin: 30px auto; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;" alt="Generative designs for SDSC-Connect" src="/assets/image_775389.jpg" border="0"></a></p><p>I’ll do my best to do justice to all four projects, but either way it should be an interesting event. My session is at <a href="https://sdsc-connect.ch/#SDSCCONNECT2020" target="_blank">11am in Central European Time</a>: I know this won’t work for all but the earliest risers from the Americas, but hopefully some of you further east will be able – and motivated – to attend.</p>
