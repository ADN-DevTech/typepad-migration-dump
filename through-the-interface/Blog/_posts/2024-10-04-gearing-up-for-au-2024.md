<p>We’re once again in the craziness before the storm (hmm - wasn’t there meant to be some calm?!?) that is Autodesk University. Requests for meetings are gradually filling up calendars… from my side it’s looking like another busy (but very fun) event.</p>
<p>As a reminder, <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2024/08/sign-up-for-au2024-classes-today-here-are-some-suggestions.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here are the classes that I’ll be part of</a>, in some capacity this year. <a href="https://conferences.autodesk.com/flow/autodesk/au2024/sessioncatalog/page/inperson/session/1714403202332001pGmI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The class on extending Forma</a> - where I’m co-speaking - has the slides and handout posted, in case you want to check it out ahead of time.</p>
<p>In anticipation of this year's event (and the chance to connect with academic partners, customers and internal product folks working with XR) I went ahead and picked up a Meta Quest 3.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/image_848281.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="display: block; margin: 30px auto;" title="Trying the Quest 3" src="/assets/image_848281.jpg" alt="Trying the Quest 3." width="375" height="500" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>It’s been a while since I’ve paid active attention to the XR space, I fully admit: my previous device was the original Quest, so I’ve somehow skipped the Quest 2, the Quest Pro and the Apple Vision Pro. At least for now. But I am interested in my team exploring opportunities around using XR (mainly VR, but eventually MR, too) to capture data that’s valuable during the design process. Whether this is using tools such as Autodesk Workshop XR or something else entirely remains to be seen.</p>
<p>I will be posting a bit more about this renewed interest in XR over the coming months, but for now here’s a “blast from the past”. I used an internal build of Workshop XR to explore the old Autodesk office in Toronto - the one at 210 King Street East - which was the original demo model in <a href="https://www.research.autodesk.com/projects/project-dasher/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dasher 360</a>. I’ve spent so much time in that model - albeit in the APS viewer - that it feels like a second home, but I’d never successfully visited it in VR. (I say “successfully” because I remember trying to do something with it - perhaps with Revit Live? - that was less than compelling.)</p>

It’s certainly something for which we’d occasionally hear requests, back in the Dasher days.</p>
