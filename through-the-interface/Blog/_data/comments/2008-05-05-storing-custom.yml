  body: 'Hi Kean,


    Yes, disable UAC...I have done this on my first Vista day. Guess UAC is more suitable
    for commom users.


    Regarding to this post, I remember some articles about Microsoft saying that registry
    will be removed soon from Windows on the next releases.

    In this case, there is a better solution to store user settings (by profile) which
    is through XML configuration files.


    What are Autodesk plans regarding AutoCAD user profile settings, windows Registry
    and XML configuration files?


    Could give us some trends and overview bout this so we can avoid investing time
    into features that will be soon deprecated?


    Regards,

    Fernando Malard.'

    and frankly I''d expect the API used in this example to simply write to wherever
    we store profile information in that Brave New World. :-)


    As mentioned above, I''m planning on looking more into System.Configuation in
    a future post - hopefully this go some way to address your question about config
    files vs. the Registry.

    Excellent post.  Looking forward to the next one too!


    Is it possible to bind a windows control to one of these registry settings?  For
    example, a text box to your "TestString" property.  I''m already planning an additional
    tab in the Preferences dialog, and this would eliminate quite a bit of additional
    validation code.  Maybe I need to create a custom class that handles the registry
    settings and bind the control to a property of the class?'

    I''m getting exception reading:

    I believe this is supported by System.Configuration, but I''ll need to do some
    research. And I have a few other posts that may come in between, I''m afraid.


    Jose -


    Did you change the code, at all? It sounds as though you have a "type mismatch"
    between what was written and what you''re trying to read back in.

  body: 'It appears that the values stored in the Registry via the API all get converted
    to strings (type REG_SZ). This API doesn''t appear to work for reading arbitrary
    values of non-string type (such as REG_DWORD).


    So it''s good for storing/retrieving your own values in a profile, but not for
    retrieving profile settings - you should stick to standard Registry access techniques
    for those.
