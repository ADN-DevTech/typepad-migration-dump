  body: I am a little confused. If I build a form with the Visual Studio UI designer,
    it will extend Form. Do you mean, I cannot then do myForm.ShowDialog()? How am
    I supposed to use the Editor?

    My mistake. My edits were incorrect: I should have put Application instead of

  body: My experience with the Application.ShowDialog or Application.Show ist that
    it works fine with a parent or main form.  However, if I have child forms that
    spawn after a button click, then the Application.ShowDialog functions are not
    reliable.  Unfortunately, I don't have a specific example to submit to you or
    DevHelp to show you what I mean.  But the long and short of it is that I use the
    Application.Show functions for generating the parent form, and then I use the
    forms built-in / inherited method of .Show for the child dialogs.

  body: '"2. Dialog size and position will be persisted automatically"


    This probably not .NET API issue, but the automatic persisting could be a problem,
    when you sometimes have to connect your computer to different number of monitor.
    Say, if you use your laptop in office with 2 screens, you place one of your .NET
    API dialog box (modal!) on second screen and close it there. Then you carry your
    laptop to a presentation with a projector (only one screen), start AutoCAD, run
    your commend to show the dialog box. Now your AutoCAD would appear frozen without
    reason. You can only kill the Acad process from task manager. That is because
    the dialog box is shown somewhere outside the screen (the persisted position on
    second screen). I was embarrassed when running into this in the exactly situation,
    and I could not show anything in that presentation until I came back to my desk,
    connected back to my second screen, dragged the dialog box back to primary screen
    and close it from the primary screen.


    So, if I want to show a dialog box, and the first 3 reasons you listed are not
    important to me (1. I''d like my own icon; 2. I do not want Acad remember dialog
    box location, it should always on primary screen, and 3. Since it is dialog box,
    one cannot access other Acad window anyway), what other unexpected behaviors would
    be if I simply use System.Windows.Forms.Form.ShowDialog()?


    Of course, if Acad is clever enough to detect if the persisted location is valid
    in available screen(s), if not, show dialog box in primary screen, then the reason
    2 would be a benefit as you say.'

    and unhides forms that are not shown via the Application methods, before/after
    the form code calls a GetXxxxx() method of the Editor.

  body: 'Yes - Tony''s point is likely to be a concern for modeless dialogs not displayed
    using ShowModelessDialog().


    Around the dialog display issue: one option, in lieu of AutoCAD checking the bounds
    of a dialog before display, would be for you to manipulate (or simply remove)
    the location information stored for the dialog:


    HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Autodesk\AutoCAD\R17.2\ACAD-7001:409\Profiles\AutoCAD\Dialogs\MyApplication.MyForm

    Are you trying to check this from an external COM application? If so, you''re
    probably going to get some kind of COM server time-out that you might be able
    to trap programmatically and then use SendKeys to fire off some escape characters
    to the application, hoping to cancel the open dialog(s).

    Modeless dialogs are intended for top-level modeless input (e.g. Property Palettes,
    Tool Palettes, etc.). I haven''t heard of them being launched and used within
    a particular modal context (i.e. with a number of other modal dialogs being displayed).


    I''m actually surprised this has ever worked, to be quite honest.

    You should be able to do what you want by calling Form.Show(), although this means
    you won''t get the 4 advantages listed in the article.

    It sounds as though you''re not locking the document.


    The best way to address this is to launch your own custom commands from your modeless
    UI, rather than modifying the drawing directly. Commands typically lock the current
    document automatically, which makes life easier.
