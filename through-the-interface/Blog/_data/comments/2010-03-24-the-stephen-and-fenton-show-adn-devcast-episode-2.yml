    Great tips.

    I''m glad to "meet" Cyrille who helped me a lot through ADN support channel when
    I''ve started with ObjectARX back in 1996.


    Keep doing these videos, they are really cool!


    Cheers.'

  body: 'I noticed the text that was displayed when hard and soft relationship was
    explained. It was indeed very helpful to have this subtitle, without which it
    could be very difficult to understand.


    It will be more productive and efficient, if the entire video is subtitled - I
    know it is a big work, but then the benefit that comes out is also great.


    Thanks again.'

  body: "Hi Narayanan,\n\nThank you for you kind comments. I'm glad you liked it.\n\
    \nHowever, we're not planning to subtitle the entire video. This being a podcast,\
    \ its something we record and produce quickly and with quite low production values\
    \ - and subtitling everything would turn producing each episode into a major operation.\n\
    \nThat said, its good to know the callout text we used was effective. Now I've\
    \ discovered this feature in Camtasia, I am planning to use it more in the future\
    \ to highlight key points.\n\nCheers,\n\nStephen \n-----"
