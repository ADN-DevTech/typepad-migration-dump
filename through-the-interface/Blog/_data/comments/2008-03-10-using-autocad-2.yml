  body: "Hi Kean. Thanks for another great example.\n\nOne thing you and your readers\
    \ may want to make note of, is regarding:\n\n\"We do not currently have a viewChanged\
    \ event exposed through the managed API, so we check for DocumentLockChanged and\
    \ then see whether the view has changed there\".\n\nI've also tried using this\
    \ method of detecting view changes, but found that it is not reliable, mainly\
    \ because no document locking event fires when you change the current view using\
    \ transparent middle-button pan or mouse wheel zoom. \n\nAfter giving up on that,\
    \ I built a mixed-mode managed wrapper for AcEditorReactor2, which I've also made\
    \ freely available for anyone who needs a more reliable means of detecting view\
    \ changes:\n\n  http://www.caddzone.com/AcEditorReactor.zip"

    Having finally got a point to reflect the current PDMode (using a call to SetDatabaseDefaults())
    I am still unable to get a text entity (with anchorpoint) to display or a polyline
    with lineweight... are these limitations of me or the TransientManager?'

  body: 'Hi Crispin,


    I haven''t tried myself, but I know it is possible to get text to display... in
    fact, if I recall correctly it''ll be part of the demo in next week''s Transient
    Graphics API webcast (it''s on May 15th - see the <a href="http://www.adskconsulting.com/adn/cs/api_course_sched.php">API
    training schedule</a> to sign up).


    Not sure about the polyline with lineweight - you''ll be able to ask during the
    webcast or simply submit the question via the ADN website.


    Regards,
