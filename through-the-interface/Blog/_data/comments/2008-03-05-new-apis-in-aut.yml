    do you have an example of making use of the geo-location functionality? in germany,
    it appears that gauss-krueger coordinates are very commonly used, for instance
    when building tunnels. these cause huge coordinates, and this causes precision
    problems when calculating and comparing geometry in autocad. maybe this new geo-location
    functionality could help alleviate these problems?


    cheers

    That .NET reference is nice but it is just a REFERENCE. The Object Browser in
    the VS shows the same (or the Reflector). A real ''Developers Guide'' with samples
    would be much more usefull (just like ObjectARX API).

    No, I don''t have a sample, but if you want to work on one, I''ll post it for
    you. :-) Unfortunately I don''t know whether the Geo-Location feature addresses
    those precision issues.


    (For those of you who don''t know Jeremy, he''s a member of the DevTech team in
    Europe.)


    Zolee -


    Yes, but it''s a first step. The plan is to integrate more and more samples directly
    into the reference. Incidentally, the existence of samples doesn''t automatically
    make it a Developer Guide, which is typically more a step-by-step guide for creating
    certain types of application functionality.


    So this reference will definitely grow over time, and potentially will be completed
    by wiki-style community documentation (what this space).

    Looking forward to the in depth look at some of the APIs.


    I''d like to see more on the ribbon, .. using the API do you think we will have
    the ability to create a second Ribbon to dock elsewhere for our custom apps/code.

    about working with the single Ribbon inside AutoCAD.


    This type of UI functionality may well be in other applications of ours, over
    time, but I don''t see the underlying framework being made available to be used
    freely in standalone applications.

  body: 'Hi Kean,

    because of some trouble we have sometimes with the large coordinates, I told this
    to Jeremy and he has written it here.

    The new class AcDbGeoData sounds interesting, but till now I didn''t founnd an
    example.

    But the point, that don''t sound good is:

    "AcDbGeoData also provides coordinate transformation functions to convert coordinates
    between DWG drawing space and geographic space."

    If I have still a coordinate conversion, I think the problem with the precision
    stays the same

    We''ll see if we can come up something you can use to test this issue again (please
    continue to work with Jeremy). As you''ve said, if it''s largely about coordination
    transformation I''m doubtful it will be of much help in this particular scenario,
    but then you never know.

    the problem here is, that it''s really hard to know when it works, because the
    bugs with the large coordinates show up not very often (but still too often).
    But we will see

    Jeremy, I guess you are attempting to use GeoLocation to transform coordinates
    from Gauss-Krueger to WGS84 (and vice-versa). It''s simply up to setting proper
    transformation parameters - coordinates (neither their precision) themselves don''t
    have much to do with this issue. Autodesk has been using Mentor library within
    MAP to enable coordinate transformation services. Mentor library is open source
    now, I guess. Other popular open source library targeting coordinate transformation
    and reprojection is PROJ4.

    In a very small number of cases some changes are needed (usually because "incorrect"

    happen, which is also true of genuine compatibility issues).
