  body: 'Hi Kean.


    I have to switch to 2D wireframe mode constantly when working with 3D objects.


    I have to do that, because for some strange reason that I cannot seem to find
    a reasonable explanation for, Grips on 3D objects cannot be selected even when
    visible, if they''re obscured behind a surface. That''s true for all modes that
    have some kind of shading, and also true for "X-Ray" mode.


    Grips are user-interface elements, not model elements, and the fact that they
    can''t be used in that context is particularly-puzzling.'

    Actually my input-gathering is less about driving towards a unified GS than it
    is about reducing the dependency on a specific GS and its behaviours (and quirks).


    That''s probably about as much as I can say, at this stage. :-)

  body: 'Possibly. But the needs of a 2D graphics system can be quite different to
    those of a 3D graphics system, so the answer is unfortunately much more complicated.
    WHIP has evolved to be a *really* good 2D GS, over the years. Unifying under a
    single GS might appear to be a good thing, but a lot depends on the specific GS
    and its capabilities.

  body: 'Hi Tony,


    Thanks - interesting feedback.


    The foreground objects must be absorbing UI events when even partially shaded.
    The Wireframe Visual Style appears to behave as 2D Wireframe, in this respect,
    so at least it''s consistent across 2D and 3D graphics systems (even if it''s
    not what you''d like to have happen).


    It might be interesting to allow the user to enable background grip manipulation
    when in (for instance) the X-Ray VS, though. There are no doubt issues related
    to this that I''m smoothing over, but I can see how it would be useful.

    Actually, as Alex pointed out, there was a new sysvar added in AutoCAD 2011 that

  body: 'Very interesting topic.


    We have somewhere around 150 custom enties and have some very complex viewportDraw()/worldDraw()
    implementations and make heavy use of both the AcGi*Draw interfaces and the transient
    graphics API.


    In our structural modeling package users want to use 2D (or 3D Wireframe) to create
    the system, and use 3D to check a solid/mesh representation (e.g. extruded cross
    sections along beams, etc.). While we switch to a different visual representation
    on-the-fly, we also have a setting in our visualization options UI that allows
    the user to control this behaviour in more detail.


    While technically it works OK most of the time, there are two main issues with
    3D for us:


    1) Caching: Invalidation is required to keep the two GS representations in sync,
    and sometimes that fails and in any case, requires quite some tweaking.


    2) The 2D GS in combination with 3D Orbit behaves funny/unexpected at times, but
    this may at least partially because of the two representations we provide.


    In our detailing package different aspects of the 2D GS are way more important
    and I totally understand why 2D can be harder than 3D to get "right", for some
    definition of "right" (having implemented 2D editors myself).


    One recent issue that comes to my mind, is the handling of draw order: For example,
    custom entities, AutoCAD entities, hatches, wipeouts are created in a certain
    draw order to yield a specific visual result. Unfortunately, at the moment we
    run into issues where the draw order changes unexpectedly (checked using the API)
    if some of the objects are modified/updated or new objects are created. This can
    result in a different plot - which is not really acceptable.


    Looking forward to hearing about what you guys come up with!'
