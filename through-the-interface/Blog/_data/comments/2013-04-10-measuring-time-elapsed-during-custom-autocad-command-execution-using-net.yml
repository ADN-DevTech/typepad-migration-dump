  body: 'Thanks, Kean. Exactly, it is running very fast now. Nevertheless, I guess
    it brought us some interesting discussions.


    Also, I think that you guys should look into allowing parallel programming into
    AutoCAD. With multiple CPU cores now being the industry default, the best way
    to take advantage of that hardware is to allow ''parallelization''.


    Also, thanks Scott McFarlane for his great AU2012 class, it helped me a lot.'

  body: "\"return ids.Count<Line>();\"\n\nHi Kean.  You can't use Enumerable.Count<>()\
    \ to time execution of getting items from an IEnumerable.\n\nThere's a difference\
    \ between counting items and getting them. For starters, if you give Count<>()\
    \ an array, ICollection or IList, it simply returns the value of the Length/Count\
    \ property.\n\nSecond, the work that must be done to produce each element requires\
    \ a call to IEnumerator.MoveNext() and reading the IEnumerator.Current property\
    \ to actually get the value. \n\nSince any implementation of IEnumerator.Current\
    \ could do some work if necessary, the time required to do that work evades your\
    \ measurement. \n\nMy own 'informal' test code always calls ToArray() to ensure\
    \ that all the work that must be done to produce a result, is measured.\n\nHave\
    \ a nice day."

  body: 'Hi Tony,


    Right. The point wasn''t about measuring the time to iterate over the contents
    (in this case), as much as it was about just making sure the elements were generated
    in the first place. We know we''re not dealing with arrays, ICollections or ILists,
    here, so we know we''re not just getting the Count or Length property directly.


    It''s helpful for people to know your approach for reliably measuring complete
    iteration, for cases where there may be additional things going in in the Current
    property accessor. Not the case here, but still good to know.

  body: "Hi Kean. FWIW, my comment was in-part referring to this (apparently more\
    \ generic) comment from your post:\n\n\"Bear in mind that as we’re dealing with\
    \ lazy results, we need to include the Count<>() method in the measurement for\
    \ the results to be representative \"\n\nIn any case, I'll see if I can find out\
    \ if the discrepancy that I'm seeing between the timing of Count(), and the timing\
    \ of a simple foreach() loop that gets each element (but does nothing with it)\
    \ has another reasonable explanation. \n-----"
