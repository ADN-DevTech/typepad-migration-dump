  body: 'Hi,


    How to know if a entry in the search result pane is a "web result"? Please do
    a search for "Jig". The problem seems to be that the search engine make first
    a search in the official AutoCAD docs, if there is no entry there,  then there
    is no web search, so if you search for Jig, there is no results.

    If you make a search for "VLAX-" and filter on developer and Autolisp, you obtain
    a list of vlax-functions, but the order is random, and there is no way to sort
    the result. What we need is a content tree in the left pane, and at least a way
    to sort the results, an alphabetic list of function is almost impossible to obtain.

    Why not to copy the MSDN style and that''s it.'

    I''ll pass your feedback on to the TechPubs team.


    This isn''t an area I''m very familiar with, personally, so I won''t try to address
    your points myself.

  body: 'yah, the lack of a contents tree on left is critical as lots of "about" pages
    do not have links to the actual content they are introducing.

    This kind of improvement really should be happening all the time. Things like
    help and DG interface format are never mission critical so adesk should be aggressive
    in evolving them.'

  body: This is great! As a developer I always found it difficult to find the information
    I need, but this looks really helpful :) And the first few queries I fired off
    gave me good results \o/

    I had an unrelated question to this topic, so please do accept my apology.


    Is it possible to export a .dwg file to .fbx file through Autocad .Net Api?'

    I don''t know - it may be possible to script the FBXEXPORT command (assuming that''s
    what it''s called), if not.


    You might try asking on the AutoCAD .NET Discussion Group.

    Im having trouble converting my Autocad 2013 file into photoshop. I came across
    this tutorial (<a href="http://www.cadtutor.net/tutorials/autocad/autocad-to-photoshop.php)">http://www.cadtutor.net/tutorials/autocad/autocad-to-photoshop.php)</a>
    I wanted to follow the ''plotting to EPS'' instruction however Autocad 2013 didn''t
    give me the option of  ''adding a plotter wizard''. do you have any idea on how
    i can open my cad files into Photoshop?


    Thanks'

    Have you looked at other import formats Photoshop supports? I''m sure there are
    better formats than EPS, but then I''m not a Photoshop users. I would have thought
    DXF worked...
