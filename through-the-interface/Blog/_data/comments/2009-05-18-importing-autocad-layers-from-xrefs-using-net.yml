    are there two identical readme.txt files in the ZIP and apparently two identical

  body: 'Hi Patrick,


    I''m glad you found it (even before it gets announced publicly on Tuesday :-).


    The ReadMe is duplicated because I wanted it to be outside the source folder,
    but also in the project (so it appears in the solution explorer window inside
    Visual Studio). When you add a file to a project that''s outside the project folder,
    Visual Studio copies it into the project folder. So it was a choice: only have
    it in the project folder (bad), don''t have it in the project (a little less bad),
    or have the file duplicated (the choice I went for).


    You''ll hopefully find the DLLs only to be "apparently" identical: one is for
    use in 32-bit and the other is for use in 64-bit AutoCAD versions. The source
    used to build the DLLs is indeed identical, but you need to include different
    reference assemblies (i.e. different versions of both AcMgd.dll & AcDbMgd.dll)
    depending on whether you build for a 32- or 64-bit platform. So one (the one found
    in the win32 folder) should only work on 32-bit AutoCAD, and the other (the one
    in the x64 folder) should only work on 64-bit AutoCAD.

  body: 'Hi

    Is it possible to have a .Net application, similar to NCOPY lisp, that would copy
    entities as well as it''s layers from xref to working drawing? any solution in
    this regard would be infinitely appreciated.

    Thanks,

    Johny'

  body: 'Hi Johny,


    It''s absolutely possible, and the code in the XrefOffsetCopyLayers() function
    is a good starting place (although it would also be worth experimenting with Wblock()
    and Insert(), to see whether that streamlines the process if we''re also bringing
    across entities).


    I''ll add this to my list of things to look at, when I have time, but there are
    no guarantees I''ll be able to reach it soon, I''m afraid.

  body: 'This application works with "simple" entities, such as lines, arcs, circles,
    and new-style polylines. Complex entities - such as old-style 2D polylines - may
    need some additional work to support, as the lowest level entity that gets returned
    by the selection process is likely to be a vertex. If you can make use of the
    enhanced, lightweight polylines, then that''s more likely to work without modification.


    Incidentally OFFSET only works with 2D polylines - not 3D polylines - so that''s
    not going to be enabled by this application.

  body: 'Hello Kean,


    I really like your site about automating AutoCAD, so thank you for that!

    But i am a enthausiast and not a professional. I am used to wrting my code in
    vb.net. Mostly this is not a problem as there are code-converters available on
    the web.

    The code above however does not convert correctly. For example the ''sub initialize''
    present''s a problem for me.


    Would it be possible for you to post the VB.NET code for this topic?


    Kind regards,


    Wouter'

  body: 'Hello Wouter,


    I expect it''s the delegates that have been used to implement event handlers...
    you may need to move that code into separate functions and then use AddHandler()
    in VB.NET to register the event handlers.


    I''m afraid I''m busy preparing for a trip, so I won''t be able to do this myself.
    You might try posting a link to this post to <a href="http://discussion.autodesk.com/forums/forum.jspa?forumID=152">the
    AutoCAD .NET Discussion Group</a>, in case someone there can help.

    establish the blocks that exist in the Xrefed DWG (checking which layers they''re

    but anyway - it''s doable.
