  body: 'Hi Wes,


    There''s really one main reason: the application started off as a Winforms application,
    but we wanted to add in a ribbon UI using WPF. So we packaged up the original
    UI into a User Control that gets hosted by an outer WPF application.


    The benefit being we didn''t need to rewrite the entire app to use WPF, at least
    not for now.


    Regards,

    We had considered putting a configurable option of the path to the executable
    you wish to launch (which would cause it to be launched and closed prior to the
    batch process, which should cause it to be called from then on).


    Viru is planning to add it into the next release.


    Thanks for the feedback!

  body: 'Hi Wes,


    One option would be to find a drawing that fails, for some reason, or you might
    also reduce the delay so AutoCAD just doesn''t have time to start before being
    closed (I assume that would work).


    The new version should actually be live on <a href="http://labs.autodesk.com/utilities/ADN_plugins/">Labs</a>
    right now (posted late last night), with an announcement going out on <a href="http://labs.blogs.com/">Scott''s
    blog</a> later today.


    Let us know how you get on,


    Kean'
