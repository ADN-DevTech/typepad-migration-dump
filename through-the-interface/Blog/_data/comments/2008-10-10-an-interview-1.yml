  body: 'Nice interview, but a bit disappointing that the author could not bring himself
    to credit the programming language where most FP concepts were born, which is
    LISP (now 50 years old - and from what I can tell from Murphy''s original writings,
    just a few weeks older than I) :)


    If I may also endluge in a bit of fortune telling, I believe LISP will resurge
    in a very profound way, run on the CLR and JVM, and foreshadow most other functional
    languages.


    My opinion about that stems from the most basic and interesting concept underlying
    LISP, which in Murphy''s own words, is quite simply that "LISP code is LISP data".
    In a LISP program we can manipulate one as easily as the other.


    That''s also what makes metaprogramming with LISP so easy that you don''t even
    realize you''re doing it (unfortunately, AutoLISP never gained the language features
    that make metaprogramming easy, like defmacro and friends), hence the tendency
    of many AutoLISPers to do metaprogrammming in what I''ll call the ''John Walker
    style'' (by smashing together strings containing LISP expressions), a la his original
    (autoload) function.'

  body: 'Thanks, Tony.


    There was nothing at all sinister about me not mentioning LISP, so it''s very
    good that you brought it up.


    And I''ll be very interested to see whether your prediction comes to pass.

  body: Nice job again, Kean. Tony beat me to it with the LISP comment. :)

    \ -> F#\n\nMapping all this must be tricky - the concepts that influence a language's\

    Sorry, by ''author'' I meant the author of F# (Don Syme), not this blog post.'

    In Don''s defense, he answered the questions I put to him, and I didn''t ask any
    on the general history of FP. So it really was down to me. :-)

    \ Dylan and many others have already adopted quite few attributes that have their\

    \ at all times, by virtue of Reflection.Emit, and that they are 'just-in-time'\

    \ Lambda expressions, and 'expression trees', the last of which may initially\
    \ seem puzzling to LISP programmers, merely because the LISP equivalent of an\
    \ expression tree is quite simply, a list. \n\nI also think much of that can be\
    \ attributed to the fact that one of the key architects of the CLR, Patrick Dussud\
    \ (who designed the GC) has an extensive background in LISP that goes way back\
    \ to the TI Explorer project, and also includes major language architecture roles\
    \ at Schlumberger and Lucid.\n\nA bit of trivia regarding Pat, is that he originally\
    \ prototyped the CLR's Garbage Collector in Common LISP, and then built another\
    \ LISP based tool to automate its translation to C++."
