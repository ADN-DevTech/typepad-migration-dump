    are there any other ways to force the Idle-Event to fire, instead of "changing"
    the cursor''s position? Unfortunately, this leads to extensive cursor flickering
    for me.


    Thank you!'

    Really? I didn''t see any flicker when setting the cursor to be at the same location.


    Unfortunately I don''t know of another way - you might try asking ADN or posting
    to the forums.
