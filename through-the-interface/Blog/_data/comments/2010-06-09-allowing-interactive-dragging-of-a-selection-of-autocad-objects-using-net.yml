  body: 'Hi Kean,


    I''m having trouble with translating the lambda expression into VB.NET. The code
    converter sites i used can''t translate it. Can you say how it is done in VB.NET?

  body: 'Hi Adri,


    The simplest would probably be to define a method in the Commands class and pass
    a DragCallback delegate for it to the Drag function.


    I''d need to spend some time looking at this, which won''t be until tomorrow at
    the earliest - hopefully someone out there can post a solution in the meantime.

    Change the PromptPointResult line like so:

    Dim ppr As PromptPointResult = ed.Drag(psr.Value, vbLf & "Select text location:
    ", New DragCallback(AddressOf MyDragCallback))


    And to make that work you have to pull the declaration of mtLoc out to the class
    level so it can be accessed by the delegate function'

    Thanks for another interesting post, Kean.'

    Yes - VB doesn''t require (or allow) backslash as an "escape" character to indicate
    in-line character codes (you''d typically use Chr(10) instead of "\n", for instance).
    So while we need double-backslash in a C# string to generate a single backslash
    on the output, only one is needed in VB.


    Tip: if you prefix your string with @ in C#, it''s considered literal (in the
    sense backslashes will not denote control characters). Very useful when defining
    literal paths:


    string path = @"C:\Users\walmslk\Documents";

    Why is it that when it is called from a modeless dialog it fails, even if inserting
    LockDocument(). Can you say how it is done?

    I have no idea, although I always recommend calling a command from yoru modeless
    UI via SendStringToExecute(), rather than putting the code there directly.


    It avoids all kind of subtle issues (such as this one).
