  body: 'Where can I find detailed description of the .NET api for AutoCAD. The guide
    provided by AutoDESK is basic level. As compared to the help provided for Visual
    Lisp in AutoCAD developer''s help section. There is not such help section for
    .NET. Does Autodesk have any such plan.


    Thanks.'

    You can also find AutoCAD .NET reference material in the docs folder of the ObjectARX
