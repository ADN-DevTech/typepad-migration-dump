  body: 'Barry - a great question!


    The link does need to be a hyperlink (a URL, although presumably that could contain
    a link to a local file... you might want to play around with it to see what you
    can make it do), and the only notification you get is the Closed event (for the
    status bar version) - as shown in this example.


    You''d have to implement your own balloon mechanism to call into your own code,
    right now, and it''s not clear to me how much of the existing feature could be
    re-used or whether you''d be starting from scratch.

    How can I handle the closed event on the TrayItemBubbleWindow in VB.Net 2005 and
    AutoCAD 2008?  I don''t believe VB.Net 2005 has inline delegates.'

    That was just a choice of mine - there''s no particular need to create the delegate
    inline. Just create your event handler as you would normally in VB (hitting tab
    a few times after writing "bw.Closed += " should do it).

  body: 'Hi Kean,


    I have tried both of these methods but I am experiencing a problem with the SBB
    command (which is the one I prefer). When the command is run in 2008 or 2009,
    the icon appears on the status bar but the bubble does not show. I have the tray
    settings set to display notification. The ICB command behaves corectly. Any ideas?

    Further to my earlier post. Seems the problem occurs because I have a two monitor
    display and AutoCAD is not in the main monitor. Once I swapped it over, everything
    worked fine.

  body: The bubble window does not display until the mouse is moved or some other
    various window events are fired. So in my case the user enters a command, on the
    command line, that should create a notification. They don't see one and decide
    to type exit on the command line. There is a brief outline of the bubble as AutoCad
    exits, but the user is basically unaware that a notification existed. Folks driving
    the mouse around obviously don't encounter this issue. Might there be a way to
    force that notification to appear?

    \n  ri.Title = title;\n  ri.Category = msg;\n  ri.Uri = new System.Uri(hlink);\n\

    I have a slightly unrelated question with regards to the IC Balloons. I''ve created

    least have it only display the first time the plugin is loaded?
