  body: 'Hi Kean,


    Thanks for the article. So far, I was in an opinion that PInvoking cannot be done
    for member functions as the initialisation of a type is not possible. So, I am
    using PInvoke only for global and C function calls (not sure about static functions).


    I was little surprised to read your blog saying "Viru pointed me at an interesting
    technique he’d used for P/Invoking unmanaged <b>member</b> functions". Can you
    invoke a member function without instantiating an object? I am eager to know how.


    Thanks,

    Narayanan'

  body: My preference is to switch to C++/CLI once P/Invoke starts to get complicated;
    and I roughly define "complicated" as needing classes/structs from C/C++.

    It''s a free addin to visual studio which parses entire header files (even windows.h
    !) and then generates pinvoke signatures which can be inserted into your code.'
