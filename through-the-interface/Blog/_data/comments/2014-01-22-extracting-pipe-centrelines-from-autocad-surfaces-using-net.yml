  body: 'As we (users) preform more quantification of files, and interact with competing
    products solutions like this will become mandatory. Once Autodesk released AutoCAD
    Version 2.18 in January 1986 our community was provided capable tools to solve
    design and drafting challenges.

    Twenty eight years later the user community continues to solve everyday problems
    with tools Autodesk provides.

    There are a number of disparate AutoCAD software add-ons which encounter difficulty
    in attaching lengths, or other valuable geometric values to the objects they create,
    then export.

    Somewhere downstream a person is responsible to validate payment based on quantity
    of materials placed. This solution frees that person from the drudgery of manually
    drawing 3D polylines for weeks at a time.'

    It would be great to get some feedback on what tweaks might help save users from
    even more drudgery (e.g. joining lines automatically, etc.).

  body: 'Hello Juan Carlos,


    You will need to copy & paste it into a Class Library project in Visual C# Express
    and add some project references (<a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2006/07/getting_started.html">this
    post</a> should help - if not try asking <a href="http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/NET/bd-p/152">the
    AutoCAD .NET Discussion Group</a> for help).


    I don''t post compiled files here to avoid certain financial/legal concerns.


    Regards,

    Lucrosol.com and email me a request.

  body: "I'm musing on how one might code up the logic of creating a single continuous\
    \ 3D poly from the horrid collection of surfaces the step file (.sat) make.\n\
    This is a daunting logic issue. As humans we can \"visually\" prescribe a pipe.\
    \ How does one ask a machine to do it? \nThen after you solve the simple piping\
    \ route how do you explain to the machine there are many to one relationships\
    \ of pipes, like a tree? Hmmm, growing a tree....."

  body: 'You''ve made an excellent point: how about asking the user to select the
    pipes, one after the other, and the code validates whether they connect or not
    before proceeding?


    It would also be possible to crank through and look at centrepoint intersections,
    although for large models I''d expect that to become extremely time-consuming...
