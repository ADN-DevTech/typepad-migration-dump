    If my memory serves me correctly, you can simply throw an exception (e.g. eNotApplicable)
    from your overruled Erase function to prevent the entity being erased.


    Give it a try over breakfast :-).


    Cheers,


    Stephen'

    Your memory has served you perfectly - I even tried it before breakfast, I was
    so impatient. ;-)


    I''ll post the code tomorrow.


    Thanks!
