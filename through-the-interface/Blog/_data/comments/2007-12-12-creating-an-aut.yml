  body: "Hi Kean,\nI have an anomoly in that the contents of pts collection change\

    \ place the following \"Before\" and \"After\" the above SetFrom line:\nDim s\
    \ As String = \"\"\ns = \"Before\"\nFor i = 0 To pts.Count - 1\n  s = s & vbCrLf\
    \ & \"ID \" & i & \"  X: \" &pts(i).X & \"  Y: \" & pts(i).Y\nNext i\nMsgBox(s)\n\
    SetFrom appears to return pts scaled to fit in the 1x1 base graphic? Regards,\

  body: Hi Kean, I believe you will find that running your code a few times in the
    one drawing will result in a Fatal Error, or inconsistant results. Life is one
    big mystery... Regards, Dale

  body: 'Hi Dale,


    Yes - it seems the pts array is used to return some data to the caller (perhaps
    it''s related to the clip boundary - it''s not fully clear to me what the data
    represents).


    I found that the application did freeze, if CW was called repeatedly. Interestingly
    this stopped happening if I declared the array as being exactly 5 items long,
    rather than using the default constructor (which creates a 10-item array). I''ve
    adjusted the code by passing 5 to the Point2dCollection constructor. I haven''t
    tested whether this helps in situations where a different number of vertices is
    passed in (at which point I''d use a different number to 5, of course).


    I''d be curious to know whether this helps on your side,

  body: 'Hi Kean, I have a continuing problem with multiple Wipeouts which ADN has
    stated requires a product modification. If several Wipeouts are created in the
    one drawing, AutoCAD will Fatal Error, randomly the Wipeout will have a single
    grip instead of 4, and the displayed boundary is not the same as the actual boundary.
    I thought 2009 may have resolved. Do you happen to have a brilliant workaround?
    Don''t say draw them manually...

    Thanks, Dale'

    Please send me the case and/or change request IDs by email, and I''ll take a quick

    Is there a way to programmatically hide the frames of the wipeouts created this
    way?

  body: 'Hi Leonardo,


    Not that I''m aware of. I see there''s a read-only property Wipeout.HasFrame,
    but I can''t see a way to control that programmatically (whether in the Wipeout
    class, its parent RasterImage class or the parallel COM interface).


    You might try ADN or the AutoCAD .NET Discussion Group (please let me know what
    you find out).
