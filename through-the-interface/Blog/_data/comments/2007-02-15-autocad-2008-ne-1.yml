  body: 'Great, managed C++ wrappers could be very interesting.


    The problem with that is when the custom object class/data is too complex and
    frequently updated. It''s a pain the keep the wrapper syncronized with the C++
    code.


    Maybe some macros could automate this task but it won''t help too much once the
    method''s parameters may vary a lot.


    I''m not able to think now about anything else to do this better than by hand.
    Maybe you guys from Autodesk can create a pattern or wizard to do that.


    In fact we are talking about how to fill the lack of not being able to create
    custom objects inside .NET API. The rest of the unmanaged C++ API will be covered
    soon by .NET wrappers (guess we are almost covering 90% of ObjectARX API except
    the custom object part). I don''t know much of Autodesk strategy about migration
    of the AutoCAD core to .NET but maybe this will happen soon.


    I''m just concerned about the great number of wrappers like COM and, most recently,
    .NET created just to expose the C++ core to other APIs.


    Just to think about... :)'

    I''m glad to see the updated CUISamp.  I spent a bit of time working on what I
    wanted to be a full stand alone CUI installation application before Bill Z. and
    I discussed some of the limitations of that approach.'

    Autodesk.AutoCAD.ComponentModel appears to be related to the Data Extraction feature...
    I''ll add it to my list to research and cover in a future post.

    I would like to draw a solid3d in one viewport with c#.net (AutoCAD .NET)

    It is like command SOLDRAW or SOLPROF.

    Do you know to do that?

    Where could i find a good documentation about AutoCAD .NET?


    Thanks a lot my friend.'

    I haven''t done it myself, but you might try creating a Section object and calling
    GenerateSectionGeometry() with your Solid3d.


    The best place to get documentation on AutoCAD .NET is in the <a href="http://www.autodesk.com/objectarx">ObjectARX
    SDK</a>, otherwise you might try searching the <a href="http://discussion.autodesk.com/forum.jspa?forumID=152">AutoCAD
    .NET Discussion Group</a> or this blog.
