  body: 'Hi Kean!


    I think this is definitly useful but I think you may explore more with this technology.


    Do you know Microsoft Channel 9 website?

    What about an Autodesk Channel with tech videos not only from you but from other
    ADN members?


    BTW, the video quality is really good. What is this camcorder recording resolution?


    Regards,

    Fernando.'

    Thanks for the feedback.


    I''m a hug fan of Channel 9 (and have mentioned it in <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=channel+9&btnG=»&domains=through-the-interface.typepad.com&sitesearch=through-the-interface.typepad.com">quite
    a few posts</a>), and would love to see more of this type of video (and on more
    techncial topics) from members of my team, over time. Watch this space.


    I just used the default resolution of the device (640x480), although I did need
    to post-process using VirtualDub to amplify the audio.


    Regards,


    Kean'

    Thanks for the feedback!


    We''re using Camtasia heavily for <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/devtv">our
    DevTV sessions</a> - it''s really a great tool.


    Quick videos are very unlikely to replace written posts: I do think they complement
    each other nicely and that there''s a place for both.


    Jon -


    Yes, I remember teaching you quite clearly, even though it was indeed many moons
    (and follicles) ago!


    I hear regularly from my AEC team that you''re one of our most advanced developers
    (when you ask a question they''re almost certain it''s a real problem and not
    something straightforward... and that''s a good thing :-).

    It''s very interesting to know who is behind this blog. I start programming under
    autocad one year ago and with your blog it''s easier to learn autocad .net. (I
    have 15 years old experience of MDL language developping under MicroStation)

    Thanks very much for your Help and the help of your support team (sincerely very
    efficient help)


    What I can say now that it''s very fantastic to work with autocad .net


    I''m fine to know that you speak French and you know Paris because it''s difficult
    for me to use English language.

    years ago.


    We still do all our stuff w/C++/STL/COM/MFC; lots of custom entities and object
    behavior - for Civil 3D/Land Desktop/Map -- hence, I''m not Dot Netted.


    The predominate explanation I''ve heard to move from C++ to .Net is that UI is
    maybe easier to write...but we''ve had all that nicely standardized for years
    (although I could still strangle someone at MS at least once a week/month.)


    We tend to minimize external API use, whether ObjectArx/Win32/MFC, and try to
    have portable code. Granted, it''s mostly Win32 dependent and perhaps lacks the
    latest "cool" interface widget, but our code base has to support AutoCAD 2000-latest.


    I''ve poked at your solutions at various times, but always feel that C++ seems/feels/looks
    better - or that .Net doesn''t look persuasively better.


    So sell me. Why should we switch to .Net?


    Cheers,

    <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2008/07/choosing-the-pr.html">This
    post</a> may be of some help. It doesn''t actually answer the question, but it
    does cover some of the questions I''d ask.


    I''m thinking of using your question as the basis for a post, this week. It feels
    like a good time to talk about some of the innovation I see happening in the .NET
    platform that is likely to make it increasingly compelling over the next few releases
    of the framework.

    Thank you. You''re help is and insights are appreciated.


    For us, we often find a custom entity solution provides a more complete and more
    user-friendly solution. (For example, taking dumb text and making smart labels,
    or taking limited block functionality and making smart symbols and objects.)


    We also find command line user interaction can be limiting and often clumsy, so
    we look at the desired results and work back to find the most complete solution
    with the most flexibility in changing the results. Predominately this means putting
    the behavior with the object/custom-entity.


    And most importantly, the solution should behave in a way familiar to the AutoCAD
    user. This reduces the learning curve and increases the desirability of the custom
    entity. (And is sometimes the most difficult problem to solve.)


    Clearly, our solutions require C++. Although .Net may provide a prettier/easier-to-code
    UI (although, that could be argued), I still prefer the object be responsible
    for its interface.


    I look forward to reading your take on the .Net directions.


    Cheers,

    Bill
