  body: very forward thinking. So far, with the whole 3d fab topic, the issue I have
    seen is no easy way to get the model in the computer. The photo to model tools
    have not performed well in my tests. They choke on common things like a model
    car door that is open. Maybe I missed the optimum way of doing all this, as it
    seems the only robust tools are the laser scanners that cost a bit. The fab end
    is also young, as the powder congealing type machines are not cheap enough for
    hobbyists. I'm thinking the people that can aford 3d printing, do not care about
    smell yet as the things you would waqnt to smell are alrady manufactured in other
    materials with lifelike finishes. Is there a scenario you can think of that needs
    smell involved? Not a criticism but a challenge :)
