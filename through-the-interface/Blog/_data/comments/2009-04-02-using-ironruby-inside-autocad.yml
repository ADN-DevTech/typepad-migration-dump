  body: 'Cool! Extending existing applications with IronRuby is definitely a scenario
    that we''re interested in.


    Ruby assumes that files are encoded as ANSI text. If you have a UTF-8 encoded
    file with a BOM at the start, you''ll run into trouble. For compatibility sake,
    we''ve duplicated Ruby''s behavior with UTF-8 encoded files in IronRuby, though
    we''re thinking simply ignoring the BOM if we find one when running in Ruby 1.9
    compat mode.'

    your .rb file:


    include Autodesk::AutoCAD::ApplicationServices


    Anyway: great stuff!
