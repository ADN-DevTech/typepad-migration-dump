  body: 'Interesting suggestion - thanks, Fred.


    I''ll have a think on this one - my instinctive reaction is that having the options
    hidden away may prove a little confusing and possibly harder to automate (but
    it all depends on how it''s done, of course).


    Regarding the n-state control: you could probably achieve what you want with a
    custom WPF control (assuming it''s to be embedded in a ribbon). The WPF session
    recordings on <a href="http://www.adskconsulting.com/adn/cs/api_course_sched.php">the
    API training schedule</a> may help.

  body: 'I like Fred''s suggestion and understand Kean''s concerns about hiding options.
    Why not display the last used options at the command line. If the user pressed
    enter they are used, if they enter an "O" they can change the option.

    That would be something like the native FILLET command.

    It shows current settings but allows for changes.


    On another note this tool will be interesting but unusable for me. I draw with
    a black editor background. That makes screenshots a real problem when it comes
    to printing.

    At the risk of causing scope creep, a black-and-white option would make this a
    real winner for me.'

  body: 'as long as you give command line access to options, do whatever you want.  The
    hard part is if you put options in a dialog only (no command line interface).

    I''ll make three key-ins, one for each window option or more if there are any.

    The classic command that got this wrong was qleader. That one was sure a pain
    to implement with real users.

  body: Kean, sometimes it is very important to get higher resolution than it is used
    in current AutoCAD window (e.g. the drawing is too big to be seen all). So I vote
    for having option to control resolution.

    The current implementation is just capturing the screen graphics, so I''m not
    sure how this could be made to work. You could certainly take a snapshot at a
    custom resolution if <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2007/04/taking_a_snapsh_1.html">using
    a GsView</a>, but that''s quite different.


    Maybe you have some ideas on how this could work?

  body: 'Chris,


    It''s certainly feasible, but I suspect it might be confusing... And selecting
    a window is two picks, while selecting the document or application is only a single
    letter (plus space/return), so I''m going to see how it feels with the window
    as default.


    I''m hoping to post a test later today - please do let me know what you think
    once you try it...

    Thanks for the congrats, though, even if I can''t help but feel they''re not completely
