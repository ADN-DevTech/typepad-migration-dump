    There''s no official certification for AutoCAD .NET. My team delivers Autodesk''s
    <a href="http://www.autodesk.com/apitraining">API training</a> and does provide
    an AutoCAD .NET training.


    Looking at your profile it seems you''re based in India. The next class we''re
    holding there (according to <a href="http://www.adskconsulting.com/adn/cs/api_course_sched.php">the
    schedule</a>) is April 9th & 10th, 2009, in Bangalore.


    The class is based on the AutoCAD .NET Labs which is downloadable from the <a
    href="http://www.autodesk.com/developautocad">AutoCAD Developer Center</a>, in
    case you''d rather study offline.


    Regards,

    Sorry - I''m not familiar with the .NET APIs to ACA and MEP. They should be callable
    from F#, just as they are from other .NET languages, of course.
