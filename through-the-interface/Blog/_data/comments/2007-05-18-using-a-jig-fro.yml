    If you ever get around to doing an example that supports 3D, keep in mind that
    with the Dynamic UCS feature, you have to read the current value of the Editor''s
    CurrentUserCoordainateSystem property in each jig update, and transform your block
    using that. If you do, then the jig will support DUCS like any good 3D jig should'

  body: 'Hi mspan,


    Here''s the description of the AcEdJig class (the underlying ObjectARX class for
    a jig) from the ObjectARX Reference, part of the SDK:


    >>>

    The AcEdJig class is used to perform drag sequences, usually to acquire, create,
    edit, and add a new entity to the database. If you are deriving a new entity class,
    you will usually want to implement your own version of AcEdJig. This class enables
    the AutoCAD user to define certain aspects of an entity using a pointing device,
    and it gives the programmer access to the AutoCAD drag mechanism. (The class takes
    its name from “jig,” a device used to hold a machine part that is being bent or
    molded in place.)

    <<<


    I don''t know of a pre-existing sample to do what you want - the requirement you''ve
    got is quite unusual, but not particularly difficult to solve. You have the control
    to do this from your app, for sure. Perhaps someone on the <a href="http://discussion.autodesk.com/forum.jspa?forumID=152">AutoCAD
    .NET Discussion Group</a> will be able to help.

    You said that performing a rotation jig on an entity is quite simple. For a newbie

  body: 'Hi Kean,


    Is it possible to just drag all the attributes of a blockreference, without the
    blockref itself, in one motion? We have to insert a lot of blocks (with atts)
    each with a different orientation but we''d like to have all info (the atts) nicely
    aligned and horizontal (in WCS and UCS). Prompts like this:

    - insertionpoint block?

    - rotation block?

    - position of your attributes?


    Thought i got it using AcEdDragGen but it won''t accept a sset with only subentities.
    AcEdJig doesn''t seem to offer a solution either since it''s single entities.
    I can move the atts in one motion with a rubberband but dragging would be nicer
    right?


    No can do?

    I can''t see a way of doing this, without creating an intermediate block reference
    and replicating the attribute information but no geometry. You''d still have to
    get around the attribute jigging issue, of course.

    You work for an ADN member, so I suggest posting your question via <a href="http://adn.autodesk.com">the
    ADN site</a> so one of my team can help you.


    During some selection commands I''ve been able to call Editor.SelectCrossingWindow()
    to find out the entities under the cursor, but I doubt it will work from a jig
    selection.


    ADN should be able to help more.

  body: 'Hi All,


    Just a word of caution if you''re running multiple jigs in a row. If a reactor,
    PointMonitor, custom property manager etc is listening to the mouse cursor and
    opens a transaction as part of it''s usual business then jigs past the first one
    will not work properly. To work around that, you can only do the transaction stuff
    if Editor.IsDragging is false.


    (Took me a whole day of debugging to work this out so thought others might want
    to know :) )
