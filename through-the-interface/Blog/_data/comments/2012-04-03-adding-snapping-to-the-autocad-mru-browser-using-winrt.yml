  body: 'Hi Kean,


    Cool app - my first foray into Metro. Do you have the mru.xml file that goes with
    the images in the project? I''ve hacked one up but it would be nice to have the
    one you used.


    Also, did you figure out why you sometimes have to do a manual refresh on the
    GroupedItemsPage for some images to appear? If the code that sets the ZoomedOutView
    ItemsSource is commented out or the sub-grid in the ZoomedOut xaml is removed
    then it never needs a refresh - is it timing out maybe?


    Cheers

    Jon'

  body: 'Hi Jon,


    Glad to hear you''re having a play! :-)


    The mru.xml file should be in the Images sub-folder (along with it''s related
    .png files). They all need copying to your My Documents folder (under a "MetroCAD"
    sub-folder, I believe), but it sounds as though you have that in place, already.


    I didn''t figure out why the refresh is needed, although it''s interesting to
    hear you''ve found out how it can be avoided (or what may be causing it). It may
    also be I''m setting the data-source incorrectly in the XAML and/or the code-behind...
    I should take a closer look, at some point. If you find anything further out,
    in the meantime, please do let me know!


    Cheers,

  body: 'Found the mru.xml - going blind - thanks!


    I was able to remove the setting of the ZoomedOutView ItemSource in the code-behind
    as the DrawingData is set in the DataContext of the whole page from the LayoutAwarePage
    - the ZoomedOutView xaml was able to be changed to use the cvs2 CollectionViewSource.
    However, probably not worth sharing the code as it made no difference to the end
    result!'

    Thanks for trying, though!
