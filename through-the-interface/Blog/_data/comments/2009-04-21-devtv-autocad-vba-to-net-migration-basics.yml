  body: Thank you Tony. I hadn't considered events for this first version of the demo.
    But you're right that its an important aspect of migration, and should be covered.
    I'll check out your example.

    I don''t believe this is a problem, if you are using the ActiveX API from VB.NET,
    because that is the same API used by VBA.


    The managed ObjectARX API is a different matter entirely, and there is no ''clean'',
    simple, or reasonably straightfoward way to perform a conversion of existing VBA
    code to managed ObjectARX. In other words, migrating from VBA/ActiveX to managed
    ObjectARX generally entails a complete, from-the-ground-up rewrite.


    So, if your plan involves converting existing VBA code to managed ObjectARX, this
    would be just one of many dozens of hurdles, and of course, is really just a part
    of the learning process.'

    My original recording was updated and replaced by Augusto''s recording. I didn''t
    keep a copy of my version. The latest version of the recording and the migration
    tool are linked to at the bottom of www.autodesk.com/vba.
