  body: "Hi Kean.\n\nOne minor mistake your code makes is that it reads the ModifierKeys\
    \ property multiple times.\n\nWhen reading the keyboard state to test if multiple\
    \ keys are pressed, you have to do it in one swell foop, because it is possible\
    \ that different keys may be pressed each time the ModifierKeys property is read.\n\
    \nSo for checking for CTRL+SHIFT, it would go something like this:\n\n<pre>\n\
    \  Keys CtrlShift = (Keys.Control || Keys.Shift);\n\n  bool IsControlAndShiftPressed\
    \ = (Control.ModifierKeys & CtrlShift) == CtrlShift;\n</pre>\n\nBTW, if you only\
    \ need to reference System.Windows.Forms.dll for this purpose, you can get the\
    \ defintitions of the ModifierKeys property and the Keys enum from Reflector and\
    \ add them to your own type, to eliminate the dependence on System.Windows.Forms.dll"

  body: "Hi Tony,\n\nYou're quite right. Another option would be to store the ModifierKeys\
    \ value in a local variable:\n\n<pre>\nSystem.Windows.Forms.Keys mods =\n  System.Windows.Forms.Control.ModifierKeys;\n\
    \n// Check whether the shift key is being pressed\n\nbool shift =\n  (mods & System.Windows.Forms.Keys.Shift)\
    \ > 0;\n\n// Check whether the control key is being pressed\n\nbool control =\n\
    \  (mods & System.Windows.Forms.Keys.Control) > 0;\n</pre>\n\nI'll modify the\
    \ code in the post.\n\nI hadn't even thought about the assembly reference (I had\
    \ that reference already in my test project), but that's a handy tip to be aware\
    \ of (thanks).\n\nKean"

    How can I draw something without adding it to database?

    I''m creating my own editing command for selected entity and i need to draw marker
    for current vertex(like ''cross'' for current polyline vertex).'

    In future please post your general support questions related to AutoCAD''s .NET
    API via <a href="http://adn.autodesk.com">ADN</a>, if you''re a member, or otherwise
    <a href="http://discussion.autodesk.com/forums/forum.jspa?forumID=152">the AutoCAD
    .NET Discussion Group</a>.


    You probably ought to take a look at Editor.DrawVector()/DrawVectors() or the
    Transient Graphics API (startby looking at Autodesk.AutoCAD.GraphicsInterface.TransientManager).

  body: 'Hi Mario,


    I didn''t test this with the Alt key, but you may need a different approach for
    that one (I vaguely recall there being some differences around handling Alt).


    I''m afraid I don''t have time to investigate, myself.


    Good luck,

  body: 'I truly appreciate the example above. However I''m trying to apply a similar
    use for the Tab key. Can you give me any suggestions on how to check whether the
    Tab key has been pressed?


    Also, I''m sorry about the duplicate comment.  I did get your other post to work
    with the Tab key but I''m trying to integrate this all in an Insert Jig and this
    is closer to what I''m trying to accomplish.


    Thanks!

    One small improvement; when testing the modifier keys the compare you''re using
    is greater-than-zero, &gt; 0.  This fails if the bit happens to coincide with
    the sign bit, because setting this bit represents a negative number.  Better to
    test for not-equals-zero, != 0.
