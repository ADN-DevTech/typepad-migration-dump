    not understand the India-English.

  body: In some of the videos (incl. DevTV and API webcasts from the ADCenter) I have
    watched, it is mostly some Asian woman's voice, that is almost impossible to understand
    (sorry, no prejudice, just too quiet and too much accent for my personal hearing
    - although I mostly do understand the Indian speaker). The sound qualitiy on some
    of the videos also is really not good. But all together, the idea with the Video-Tutorials
    is very good. Thank you to all, who had a part in in.
