    \ and detailed. I think it would be really a matter of usage to decide which process\
    \ is more suitable. \n\nCheers!"

  body: 'Time is one factor, but not a very significant one, all told, and one that''s
    going to reduce on both sides: right now it can take a long time to take 300+
    high quality photos of something, but the ability to process video can make this
    much quicker. Setting up the laser scanner - more so than taking a scan, I''d
    say - is somewhat time-consuming, but that will also get quicker as the technology
    evolves.


    So yes, it will mostly come down to what you want to do with the results, I suspect.
