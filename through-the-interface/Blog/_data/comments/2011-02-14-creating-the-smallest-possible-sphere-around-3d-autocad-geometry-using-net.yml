    I was trying to imagine what the Badoiu-Clarkson algorithm would look like step
    by step, so thought why not put together a frame-by-frame video of it in action.
    And here it is: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0QSDTe_keM">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0QSDTe_keM</a>


    The video covers 150 iterations, obviously with the FPS increasing as it goes.
    If I tried to show 10,000 iterations it would have been a pretty long video with
    not much happening.


    To take the snapshots I borrowed some code from the Screenshot plugin, and then
    used Windows Movie Maker to upload to YouTube.


    Cheers,

    Art


    p.s. Really cool series of posts.'

    That''s a great screencast technique... have to think of future uses for it.
