  body: 'Hi Kean,


    Nice example of how to facet curves, and of course Polyline creation.


    However, again, ObjectARX dissapoints with it''s lack of support methods. How
    on earth can they give you ability to create a Polyline3D object without any possiblity
    of enquiring about how many vertices there are on the poly, or even to obtain
    any of them and/or modify them?


    I know GetEnumerator() returns a read-only enumeration of the PolylineVertex3d
    objects used to create it, but this seems such a convoluted approach.


    Common Autodesk, you guys have to do better than that. How can you provide such
    a poorly thought out API to your product?


    I mean, using acad, you can, say, remove a vertex by doing this crazy method of
    PEDIT-VERTEX-NEXT-STRAIGHTEN-GO, what the heck is that all about??? Whoever at
    Autodesk thought that was a good idea needs to be shot.


    As a software developer myself, it really frustrates me how convoluted this API
    is, and I''m sure Kean, you can agree with me on this one.


    Cheers

    John.'

  body: 'Hi John,


    The answer is, quite simply, history. The original 2D and 3D polylines have been
    around in AutoCAD since the early days of the product (although the 3D probably
    came later, of course).


    The original design - which was decided for a number of reasons, I expect - was
    for these objects to be "complex" entities, in that they would contain a list
    of vertex entities, rather than just storing the coordinate & bulge data in an
    array or two, as the more modern Polyline object does.


    Over the years people have come to depend on the capabilities of these objects
    and so AutoCAD has maintained the implementation and ObjectARX has retained its
    API. And the .NET API, even though much more modern in nature, is based on ObjectARX
    and doesn''t hide you from this historical messiness.


    And while we provided an enhanced 2D polyline implementation (back in R14 or 2000,
    if I recall correctly), this was certainly the "sweet spot" from an efficiency
    perspective. An enhanced 3D polyline has not yet been developed, as presumably
    the benefits are fewer, although I admit I''m not aware of the thinking behind
    that decision.

    you.

    one question, when I post this into new class and try to build, I get an error
    with variable "closest" stating "Use of Unassigned Local Variable", I am not too
    good to fix that, could you please help me in this.'

  body: 'Hi Pradeep,


    I suspect it''s just a warning, although if you have "treat warnings as errors"
    set in your project, it won''t build.


    The C# compiler isn''t quite bright enough to realise the closest variable is
    always set to something in one of the various if clauses. To avoid the problem,
    you can try changing the variable declaration to:


    Point3d closest = Point3d.Origin;

    I''ve coded something up that works for curves with the same basic number of control
    points, knots and weights. I''ll post it later in the week.
