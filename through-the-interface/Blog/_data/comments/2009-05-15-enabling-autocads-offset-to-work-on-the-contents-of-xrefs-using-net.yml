  body: Try the command NCOPY, which is part of basic Autocad.  I agree with your
    post though, nested offset is very convenient.  Offsetting multiple is also very
    useful, which offsets to both sides of a line.

    \ you read my comment. \nI'm searching for a way to use the Offset command on\
    \ polyline segments (Autocad 2010). My users use lots and and lots of polylines\
    \ and would like to offset parts of them without the need of manually exploding\
    \ it. \nI think this plugin could be extended so it supports plines? Thank you."

    Thanks!


    What you''re suggesting is certainly possible, but outside the scope of this particular
    tool (you should be able to do it yourself by starting with the provided code,
    assuming you''re a programmer).


    This tool enables OFFSET for blocks and xrefs by temporarily copying the picked
    item to the modelspace. You could do the same for polylines - the trick would
    mainly be to decide when a segment should be copied rather than just letting OFFSET
    work on the whole thing (which people clearly want, very often). It could easily
    be controlled via an application setting or system variable, of course.


    I''ll also keep this in the hopper of ideas for future tools, though, as it is
    an interesting suggestion...

  body: 'Hi Kean, a little off topic but could this method be used to pull across
    entire xref objects and retain their settings applied in the parent drawing?


    My thinking is that this could be a useful way to ''''bind" nested xrefs.'

  body: 'Hi Matinau,


    This post is a slightly special case, where we pull geometry in temporarily for
    the OFFSET command to find.


    You could certainly access settings in the xref and apply them in the host, but
    you''d have to be careful about introducing unexpected behaviour (I suggest testing
    very thoroughly).
