    Hope the recording is a good one.

    ... and includes some of the Q & A.

    Maybe one day we''ll manage to do one of these sessions at a time that''s down-under
    friendly.


    Enjoy your weekend, Kerry.

    Unfortunately i missed this one, which i really wanted to watch, because I have
    some burning issues with objectarx .net which i wanted to ask some questions about.


    In particular, the manipulation of 3D objects using .Net. What I wanted to know
    about was the programatic modification of 3D objects, using the objects <b>grip</b>
    points. Now, this is easy enough do to manually through the Aca editor, but a
    bit of a mystery to do programmatically. Now it must be possible, otherwise there
    would not be a method <b>GetGripPoints(...)</b> on Entity. The documentation on
    this methed (and many many more) is to say the least - lacking, so people like
    me have to scrounge around for help externally, and on sites like this one.


    I do not wish to question the reason for this lack of documentation (ie a push
    to ADN membership), however, I really do hope that someone out there could shed
    some light on this topic...Kean maybe ;-)


    And yes, I do really want to know how to do this, as I am developing a tool that
    requires such fine grained control over entities, as what you get when you use
    the Grip points when in the editor. :-)


    Thanks!!


    John.'

  body: "Hi John,\n\nThe best place - other than via <a href=\"http://adn.autodesk.com\"\
    >ADN</a> - to ask this kind of question is on <a href=\"http://discussion.autodesk.com\"\
    >our online discussion groups</a>.\n\nThe grip protocol (GetGripPoints() and MoveGripPointsAt())\
    \ was really designed to be called by AutoCAD, rather than by application code\
    \ (there are assumptions being made by object implementors that may not remain\
    \ true if you try to use the mechanism differently). \n\nGrips are generally implemented\
    \ to change the state of objects via their other exposed methods. The problem\
    \ I expect you're having is with 3D Solids, where the modification protocol is\
    \ currently less than fully fledged. This is something on our radar: having some\
    \ \"history API\" for solids would clearly be of benefit to many users of the\
    \ API, especially those dealing with 3D. That said, perhaps someone on the discussion\
    \ groups has some clever ideas on how to implement what you're trying to do.\n\
