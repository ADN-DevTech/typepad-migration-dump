  body: Thank you very much, it works! However, before a loop reading drawings (which
    is not here) is the need to remember the workingdatabase, and after leaving the
    loop to restore it. Otherwise, it comes to crash AutoCAD.

  body: 'Yes, that''s why I showed that in the DGNPURGEEXT implementation. You could
    put that into the helper function, of you prefer, but as it''s redundant for DGNPURGE
    I chose to leave it outside.

    drawings. Express flatten not cope, superflatten too. Maybe I could send you some
    drawings for analysis and can you do about it remedied? I am not a member of ADN,
    and I think that it is so nasty thing that no one will not. This should solve
    a pro.'

    Is there a reason you P/Invoke acdbHandEnt rather than using db.TryGetObjectId(new
    Handle(i), out id) ?'

    I seem to recall there was a reason, but I can''t remember what it was off the
    top of my head. I''ll take a look after the weekend (I''m still on holiday, this
    week) and will let you know if indeed there was one.


    Cheers,

  body: 'Hi again Gilles,


    Apologies for the delayed reply.


    The reason is pretty simple: according to <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2012/12/purging-unwanted-dgn-linestyle-data-from-an-autocad-drawing-using-net.html">my
    original post</a> I picked that part of the code up from <a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/autocad/2012/05/whats-the-best-way-to-iterate-through-an-entire-database.html">this
    post on the AutoCAD DevBlog</a>.


    When I get some time I''ll give it a try to see whether TryGetObjectId() gives
    comparable results.


    Thanks & regards,

    By my side, I use TryGetObjectId() and it seems to give comparable result (I don''t
    know about performances).

    In the post on the AutoCAD DevBlog you mention, there''s a comment from Maxence
    Delannoy which suggest to use TryGetObjectId() too, French thinking ?...'

    Cool - thanks for letting me know. I''ll be sure to take a look.


    You might well be right about it being down to French thinking. I''d be more inclined
    to agree if Philippe, the author of the post, wasn''t also French. ;-)


    I see Maxence''s comment was posted some time before I picked the code up. Shame
    on me for not having spotted it sooner.

  body: 'This version of the command works on drawings not loaded in the AutoCAD editor,
    but AutoCAD still needs to be running. You could either build the code into a
    .NET DLL and NETLOAD it into the Core Console (search this blog for more on that)
    or copy/paste the code into a RealDWG app if you really want to run this outside
    of AutoCAD (you''d need to license the RealDWG toolkit for this, of course).
