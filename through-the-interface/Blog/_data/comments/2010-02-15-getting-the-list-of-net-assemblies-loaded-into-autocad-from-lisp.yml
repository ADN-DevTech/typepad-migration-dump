  body: "I added this after the dllname declaration/assignment to provide more information:\n\
    \nif (dllname == \"<Unknown>\")\n  dllname = assem.ManifestModule.ScopeName;\n\
    \nThis uses a property that does contain something even when the Name property\
    \ is \"Unknown\" (and presumably indicates some kind of logical assembly when\
    \ there perhaps isn't a physical one, I can only guess).\n\nThe first one that\
    \ came up was \"ContextualTabSelectorRules.dll\", and appears to be related in\
    \ some way to AcWindows.dll.\n\nThe second was stranger: it has a randomly generated\
    \ name (the 3 times I tried it it came up as 5hd_wdai.dll, k8gjwxlk.dll and xng6wql.dll)\
    \ and appears to be related to System.dll, and so is a core framework assembly.\n\
    \nCheers,\n\nKean"
