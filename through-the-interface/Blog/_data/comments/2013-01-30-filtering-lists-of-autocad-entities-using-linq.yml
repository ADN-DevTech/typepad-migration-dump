  body: 'Nice blog post, glad to see that you''re diving a bit into LINQ, too :) I
    often wish that more AutoCAD collections would implement IEnumerable<T> so that
    I could apply LINQ more often.


    Anyway, you probably know this, but I''d like to point out that for single statement
    lambda expressions, you can omit the curly braces and the return.

    That enables you to rewrite

    Select(o => { return o.ObjectId; }) to the shorter

    Select(o => o.ObjectId)


    As LINQ-expressions often combine multiple function calls, this saves quite some
    space :)


    Best Regards

    The ObjectId class does not have the ObjectClass property in AutoCAD 2007&2008.How
    to use the LINQ expression in AutoCAD 2007&2008?'
