  body: 'Hi csharpbird,


    It seems the Entity.Bounds property is new to AutoCAD 2010 (from what I can tell
    - I didn''t write this code and don''t recall using the property before) but you
    may be able to use BlockReference.GeometryExtentsBestFit() in prior versions (again,
    I haven''t tried it).


    Regards,


    Kean
