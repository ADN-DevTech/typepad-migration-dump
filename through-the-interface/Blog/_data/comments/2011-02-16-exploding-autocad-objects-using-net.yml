    example is really good cause it´s short as possible. I wonder is there any example
    to explode ex. Civil 3D Pipe or Struct objects and what kind of objects expode
    returns? I know that "they" are quite complex objects, but I just like to know.
    =) Keep on a good site...'

    I don''t use Civil 3D, myself, but hopefully someone else will comment on how
    well the approach works with its objects.

    Certainly. The currently implementation does explode MText to DBText, but I can
    certainly add something to show how to use ExplodeFragments().

  body: 'Kean,


    A thread over at theswamp had me looking at the differences in behavior between
    Entity.Explode() and the explode command when the entity is a blockreference.  In
    that case, the user''s block has an mtext [not an attribute] with a field.  The
    explode command preserves that field, whereas Entity.Explode() does not.


    Noting that difference, I checked one more item.  Geometric constraints in a block
    reference are preserved by the explode command, but they aren''t with Entity.Explode().


    In short, it looks like block references need to be special-cased.  Using BlockReference.ExplodeToOwnerSpace()
    corrects these issues [and I assume DeepCloning the objects from the BTR would,
    too.]

    - I mean that your program whit Solid3d, it can get Regions. But I''m trying to
    get from a Solid3d: lines, arcs, circles and splines. Is that using the explode
    command several times can be achieved, but I don''t know how to get it. This example
    is helpful, but I can not be done for what I need.


    I''m beginners and your blog has helped me a lot. It''s amazing.


    Thank you very much.'

    One problem we have though, is that the .Explode call on a BlockReference is not

    I see you''re trying to Explode() an AutoCAD Architecture object. I can imagine
    that might be view-dependent - I''m not sure how thos entities are implemented,

    I''ve never had issues with exploding BlockReference objects, from my side.

    By the way, once I deleted the block reference using myBlockRef.UpgradeOpen()and
    myBlockRef.Erase(), there''s a way to remove the block from the Block Table of
    the DB document? There is the necessity to do that, or I can leave the block in
    the Block Table?


    Thank you

  body: 'Hi Luigi,


    Sure - you can get the BlockTableRecord from the BlockReference, open it and Erase()
    it. I suggestpassing it through Database.Purge() first, to make sure there aren''t
    any other references to it.


    But you can also just leave the block there, if you don''t mind the extra space
    it takes up on disk. It won''t be visible until it''s inserted into the model-
    or paperspace.

  body: Hello Kean, apparently exploding entities through the Entity.Explode() method
    does not work for mirrored entities, because those have a non-uniform scaling
    (mirroring applies a negative scale on one of the axes). However, the command
    line "X" command Works on those mirrored entities. Are there any workarounds for
    this through the API?
