  body: Thanks very much Kean. Your efforts have taken the mystery out of the "cloud"
    process, which is always the hardest part.

  body: 'Hello Kean,


    Thank you for all your efforts about the mobile stuff and the cloud integration,
    it was all interesting and fun. I would like also to bring to your attention something
    else, which could finally become one of your future projects :) I was wondering
    if you already know about an input device called "The Leap" (<a href="http://www.leapmotion.com).">http://www.leapmotion.com).</a>


    In case you don''t know it, this is some gesture control device, like Kinect,
    but cheaper (70$) and with a much higher precision and resolution (remember Minority
    Report style computer interface?) It is able to precisely interpret gestures in
    an eight cubic feet volume above the device itself, and it''s supposed to be provided
    with an API. I think it would be interesting to explore it a little bit from a
    CAD user prospective and to do a little comparison between the two technologies
    (The Leap and Kinetics). What do you think about ?


    Thanks for reading this,


    Constantin'

    It''s certainly on my radar: I''ve registered for a developer''s kit, but we''ll
    see if I ever receive one.


    Cheers,

  body: 'Hi Kean,


    I''ve finally gotten around to reading the summary and I''m pretty impressed by
    the breadth/depth of the coverage you''ve achieved.


    I''m sure I''m not alone when I say it''ll be pretty handy to have these posts
    as a resource in future.


    Great work!


    (I''m doubly impressed that it was my question about 3D Printing which initially
    formed the basis for all this) :D'

  body: 'Hi Alex,


    Yes, your tweet ended up forming the basis for the longest running series of posts
    this blog has seen (especially if you include the variable density fill-related
    ones).


    I probably would have ended up doing the cloud/mobile series anyway with something
    a bit less graphical, but the Apollonian code was really (in my opinion) a perfect
    fit.


    Thanks for the inspiration! :-)
