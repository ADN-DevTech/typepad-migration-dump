  body: Just a note to those that download and install this, that it will affect any
    kind of scripting that automates any of the affected commands, if the scripting
    tries to attach something in a non-World UCS intentionally, or not. I suppose
    that all the hoops that most AutoCAD commands jump through to avoid user interaction
    when they're being scripted was not an option here.

  body: 'Hi Tony,


    Is this warning based on testing or analysis of the code?


    Glenn has included a test of the appropriate flag of CMDACTIVE (& 4), to make
    sure the dialog doesn''t get shown when a script is running.


    If you have specific scenarios where this is inadequate, please share them.


    Regards,


    Kean'

  body: "Hi Kean. By 'scripting' I was referring to any type of automation of the\
    \ command line, be it via a .SCR (script file) or by LISP. \n\nThe CMDACTIVE bit\
    \ that tells if LISP is running is not 4, it's 32."

  body: 'Actually the code is, in fact, checking for script files (*.scr) via appropriate
    CMDACTIVE bit (4).


    It seems we''re not checking for LISP (bit 32), but that''s a simple enough fix
    - I''ll post a new version to Labs today.
