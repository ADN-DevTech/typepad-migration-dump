    I have an iteresting idea, can you write something about kd-trees and findind
    the nearest neighbor point?'

    I''d love to, but I''d first have to understand what kd-trees were, apart from
    anything else. :-)


    I''m not really an algorithms guy, truth be told: if there''s a particular technique
    you can point me to (on Wikipedia, say), then perhaps I can put something together
    with some help from my team.

    I would be very pleased if your team and you write something about this.

    I generally don''t have time to provide support, unless the issue is directly
    related to my blog posts.


    What you want is possible, but a lot depends on your specific requirements. You
    can use the FLATSHOT command or the HLR (Hidden Line Removal) API on the ObjectARX
    SDK to create a flattened view of a solid. You can also explode the solid to try
    and get curves that might get recomposed into a polyline.


    The devil is in the detail. I suggest posting a more detailed question to <a href="http://adn.autodesk.com">the
    ADN team</a>, if you''re a member, or otherwise <a href="http://discussion.autodesk.com/forums/forum.jspa?forumID=152">the
    AutoCAD .NET Discussion Group</a>.

    I explode the solid to a region and a surface but i do not know how to get the
