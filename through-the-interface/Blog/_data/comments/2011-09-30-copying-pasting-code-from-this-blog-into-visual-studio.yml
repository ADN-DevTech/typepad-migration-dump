  body: 'Hi Kean,


    If it is simply a question of replacing double line feeds by single ones, as your
    point 2 on ClipboardFusion seems to indicate, then would it not be even simpler
    to use the regular expression search and replace in Visual Studio itself?


    Alt-E-F-R for search and replace, then search for \n\n, replace by \n, use regular
    expressions, and hit Alt-A to replace all.


    Does that work? With no additional tool at all?


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: 'Hi Jeremy,


    Good point - thanks!


    It may very well work (assuming the double linefeed replacement works for people,
    as I''ve clearly assumed above). With any luck readers will validate and comment
    (I don''t tend to do much copying & pasting from my blog, as I have the source
    files on my system already).


    Hopefully I''m not missing an obvious problem with the search & replace technique,
    whether using ClipboardFusion, VS or otherwise.


    Cheers,

  body: Why put huge swathes of code into the body of a blog post anyway? A few lines
    to illustrate an example is fine, but if you have more than that why not stick
    it in a file and link to it instead? I know the colour coding is useful for readability,
    but when the contents of the file is opened in VS or whatever, it'll be colour
    coded there.

  body: 'The main reason is searchability. I personally dislike finding code on the
    web (e.g. in an orphaned .CS file) that I then need to somehow link back to a
    post describing what it does.


    The approach I''ve chosen for this blog hopefully avoids that, even if it inflicts
    some modest pain on its readers (and requires additional discipline from this
    author wrt column widths, etc.).
