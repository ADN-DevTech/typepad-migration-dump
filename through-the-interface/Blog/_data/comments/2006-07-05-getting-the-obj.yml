  body: 'I think your question is around whether you can use a single IDE to build
    multiple versions of your app that support AutoCAD 2002-2007...


    For AutoCAD 2002 you''ll need VC6, which is really a tough one to throw into the
    mix, as it is really very different.


    AutoCAD 2004-2006 will need VC7.0 (which is VS .NET 2002 - not 2003) to build
    the app. As the IDE for 7.0 was quite buggy, I know some people found a way to
    use the 2003 IDE with the 2002 compiler/linker to create an app that would load
    in AutoCAD 2004-2006. This is risky territory, though - born out of necessity
    at the time.


    Your best bet, in my opinion, would be to maintain separate projects for each
    set of versions you need to support (2002, 2004-2006 and 2007), but reference
    common source files where possible. You would need the separate tools (VC6, VC7,
    VC8) to perform the builds, but it feels like a much safer option to me.'

    C++ and C# have their own pros and cons - overall if I were to choose one language
    to focus on, I''d choose C#. That said, with the current state of the managed
    API documentation, you will end up having to refer back to the underlying C++
    documentation to understand what''s going on.


    I''d download the AutoCAD .NET Labs from the AutoCAD Developer Center (http://www.autodesk.com/developautocad),
    as a place to start. Otherwise, check the training schedule at http://www.autodesk.com/apitraining.

    if it has C# code will it work with Autocad 2005 and above and VS 2002 and above

    The root problem is with the amount of time it takes me to determine what code

    - frankly speaking - really only had a preview version of the managed API). I
    do try to point out when I know for sure something was only introduced in a recent
    version, but it''s not always easy to know, without performing test builds with
    multiple environments.


    And as this is really only a hobby - I have a day job, too - it''s something I
    can''t guarantee will get done for every post (otherwise it will reduce the amount
