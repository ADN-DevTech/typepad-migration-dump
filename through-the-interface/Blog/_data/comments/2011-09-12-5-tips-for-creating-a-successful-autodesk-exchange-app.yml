    .net prog''s only?

    As long as the tool provides a set of commands to the user, and a menu, hopefully
    things like lisp vlx progs would be allowed.'

    I believe the Autoloader mechanism handles any application module type currently
    supported by AutoCAD (although I''m not sure about VBA, given the fact it''s now
    a separate download).

  body: ah, very nice. Is access to the site still limited to the icon in 2012?  It
    seems to me they would at least allow access to the site from 3 versions back
    from latest, since subscription customers pay but do not upgrade immediately.  I
    would think the marketing idea here is momentum, get lots of apps going fast.
    So I don't want to have to fire up 2012 every time I want to just check what is
    available.  Just seems odd the approach is to limit, instead of open up.

  body: 'There''s a URL for accessing the store:


    <a href="http://exchange.autodesk.com/autocad/store">http://exchange.autodesk.com/autocad/store</a>


    ...but it''s currently redirected back to the top Exchange page. I have no idea
    why this would be the case.


    I understand why it has to be limited to 2012 plug-ins, because the plug-in API
    is new to 2012. But restricting access to the store only through AutoCAD? Baffling.


    Let''s say I''m a user who has a use for an app and I need to get my non-AutoCAD-using
    manager''s approval for it. Why can''t I just email the manager a URL?


    Or let''s say I''m a user in an environment where in-AutoCAD access to Exchange
    is broken because of proxy or firewall issues and/or I don''t want to put up with
    the on-line Help''s performance failings. (This is not a hypothetical case for
    me; both reasons apply). Why prevent me from shopping for plug-ins? Why remove
    me from your developers'' potential customer list?


    That''s not focus, it''s blockage.'

  body: 'Hi Steve,


    If it''s blockage, the good news is that it''s likely to be temporary blockage.


    As I stated in my previous comment, we had to start somewhere: there was nothing
    Machiavellian in the choice of the current design, I can assure you. In some ways
    it makes sense but in others - some of which you have rightly pointed out - it
    makes less.


    (To give you my opinion - which is mostly speculation, as I wasn''t involved in
    the design decision - one of the main areas it made more sense, at the time, related
    to the fact that apps needed one-click install... if you''re running Exchange
    outside of AutoCAD this creates all kinds of testing and support implications,
    which simply added complexity we didn''t need for the initial roll-out.)


    The mid-stream, in-product only release of the Apps tab has allowed us to get
    valuable feedback - admittedly from a reduced set of customers, for better or
    worse - which is helping us resolve problems such as this for when it really gets
    broader exposure and adoption.


    Regards,

  body: 'Well, the whole idea of Autodesk writing its own half-baked browser for use
    inside AutoCAD (rather than leaving that job to browser writers who know what
    they''re doing) is a spectacularly bad one anyway, but that''s another story...
    :)


    I''m aware that you''re not the one making these decisions and I appreciate your
    honest responses.'
