  body: "Hi Kaen,\n\nThe article is extremely useful and thanks for the same. \n\n\
    However, I wanted to find out if the process is ready to receive COM inputs? \n\
    \nAs you have mentioned here ...\"This doesn't wait until AutoCAD is ready to\
    \ receive COM requests, it seems\"!! Can I find out the busy state of AutoCAD?\n\
    \nRegards,\nManoj"

    That''s why we''re looping until we get the COM object: if AutoCAD was ready to
    answer a question about whether it was busy or not, by definition it would no
    longer be busy! :-)

  body: 'You can usually launch up to two sessions of AutoCAD. The problem you''ll
    have is connecting to the second one: GetActiveObject() is likely to always return
    the first in the ROT (Running Object Table).


    It can probably be worked around, but it won''t be straightforward.

  body: Thanks for you reply. I am able to launch the AutoCAD application and setting
    the AutoCAD window as child window in my application. I want to disable the close
    button ( X ) in the AutoCAD window. Is it possible to disable? if yes, can you
    please provide the details?

  body: "Hi Kean,\n\nFirst, thanks for your site it has been the best resource for\
    \ AutoCAD .net out there. Keep up the good work.\n\nI am using this method to\
    \ connect/open AutoCAD from an application and load a .net dll i.e. \"netload\"\
    \ to do, as you put it, \"the heavy lifting\".\nI am doing this by sending a lisp\
    \ function to the command line i.e.\n\nacApp.ActiveDocument.SendCommand(\"(defun\
    \ c:LoadMyAPP() (Command \"\"_netload\"\" \"\"C:\\\\MyApp.dll\"\")(princ)) \"\
    )\nacApp.ActiveDocument.SendCommand(\"LoadMyAPP \")\n(Sorry it’s in very basic\
    \ for those scratching the heads with the double quotes...)\n\nIs there a way\
    \ you can load a .net dll from the com library like the ‘loadapp’ functions in\
    \ arx, or using Autodesk.AutoCAD.Runtime.ExtensionLoader given that we are out\
    \ of process? \nI am assuming you can't use the AutoCad.Runtime out of process.\
    \ Is this correct? \n\nWhat I am trying to achieve is load my application on demand\
    \ ie load menus and custom application when a user clicks on a short cut on the\
    \ desktop, is there an easier way to do this?\n\nRegards from Down Under,\nEvan"

  body: 'Hi Evan,


    The best way is to <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2006/09/automatic_loadi.html">load
    your module when a particular command is called</a>. As you''re out of proces,
    the cleanest is to use COM''s SendCommand() to launch a dummy command that need
    do nothing but cause the module to be loaded (it probably makes sense for there
    to be at least an empty command called, though, to avoid an "unknown command"
    message).


    I hope this helps,

    "GetActiveObject() is likely to always return the first in the ROT"


    I realize this is not an AutoCAD specific problem and I''m looking for solutions
    elsewhere but if anyone found a way around this I''d be keen to hear it.'

  body: 'If working inside AutoCAD, there''s a tool called AdskUnsupp that exposes
    some tricky things to do in C++ via COM. This allows you to get - and choose between
    - the various running instances of AutoCAD-based products.


    I suggest asking over on the ADN DevBlog or the AutoCAD .NET Discussion Group.
