  body: 'Hi Paul,


    Thanks for your encouraging words. But I''d recommend against putting ideas like
    that (the one about charging) into my head :-).


    I intend this to continue as a free resource for developers working with Autodesk
    technologies... if people want to pay to get more information like this, they
    should join ADN (if they haven''t already, of course), as that''s the source of
    much of this knowledge.


    As for my time - I hope to continue posting as frequently as I have, but my wife
    is expecting our second child any day now. I anticipate it soon becoming difficult
    to spend the few hours that I do each week on this blog, at least for a while.


    Maybe one day I''ll write a book, but I suspect it''ll be about something other
    than programming (you never know, though). Blogs are such a great way for getting
    technical information out there quickly without the editorial/publishing process
    making it stale... and the non-linearity of the medium suits my whimsical nature.
    :-)


    Regards,

    I am missing the part where AutoCAD loads the code.  I am trying to load it when
    AutoCAD 2009 starts.  Do I make this code a WPF Class Library and then I need
    to add the dll to AutoCAD netload somewhere?


    Thanks,

    Above, it sounds like it could be defined on multiple types. Is this accurate?'

    Check out the ObjectARX Developer Guide''s "Using the ExtensionApplication and
    CommandClass Attributes" section. This clears things up...


    "The ExtensionApplication attribute can be attached to only one type. The type
    to which it is attached must implement the IExtensionApplication interface."


    and


    "A CommandClass attribute may be declared for any type that defines AutoCAD command
    handlers. If an application uses the CommandClass attribute, it must declare an
    instance of this attribute for every type that contains an AutoCAD command handler
    method."


    Makes sense me.'

    It does say in the post that you can have more than one, although I may well have
    missed the point of the comment.

    No no... nothing wrong with your post :)


    This was a response to jeffery''s comment above. Should have put his name at the
    top. My bad.


    Just that the ObjectARX MANAGED Class Reference Guide "CommandClassAttribute Class"
    section states:


    "This custom attribute class is used to mark a type as the application''s command
    class. An application may designate one, and only one, type as its command class.

    Looks like a typo!?'
