    ... and the random posts will be great for rainy Saturday afternoons :)


    Stay well.


    ps: if you''re looking for topics .. a series on unit testing with AutoCad and
    .NET would be a treat.'

    Interestingly (although perhaps it''s not a coincidence - perhaps the question
    was also asked elsewhere) you''re not the first person to ask me in the last week
    for a series on unit testing with AutoCAD & .NET.


    I pointed that person to <a href="http://au.autodesk.com/?nd=class&session_id=10350">Scott
    McFarlane''s highly rated AU 2012 class</a>, as a starting point. Perhaps Scott
    might be able to contribute a guest post or three to cover the details... I''ll
    reach out to him to see.


    I''d also like to learn more about this area, so one way or another I''ll find
    a way to get this topic covered here.


    Best,


    Kean'

  body: 'Hi Kerry,


    TypePad thought this comment was spam - probably because of the product references
    - and I only just realised. Sorry about that.


    Yes, Scott is the right person to tackle this tricky topic, and he tells me he''s
    getting to the end of Part 1 of 3. Should be a great series!


    Cheers,


    Kean
