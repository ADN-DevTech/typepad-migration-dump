  body: 'Joseph,


    I''ll send it to you via email. As Fenton mentioned in the webcast, it has a few
    display glitches that I''d like to see fixed before we post again to the ADN site.


    I''ll post a link once we have the "Custom Objects Masterclass" recording available
    for viewing.


    Regards,


    Kean'
