    Just one additional question, how would you go about determining if the spatial
    filter was inverted?


    The SpatialFilter class doesn''t appear to have easy access to this data and I''ve
    been unable to figure out how to retrieve it.'

    I don''t think I''ve ever created an inverted Spatial Filter. If you can tell
    me some steps to do so, I''ll see how you can query the fact that it''s inverted.

    see an arrow on the boundary, simply click it and it will invert the clipping.


    When looking at the DXF of such a drawing it appears that the spatial filter has
    an extension dictionary which contains an Xrecord, but when I attempt to get the
    extension dictionary from the spatial filter in code it comes back as null.  I''m
    using RealDWG 2013 in C++, but I expect the concepts should be the same.'

    Much to my surprise, it turns out this has been exposed by neither ObjectARX nor
    .NET.


    I''d suggest posting via ADN or to the AutoCAD .NET Discussion Group to request
    that this be addressed.
