  body: 'Thanks for posting the recordings Kean.


    Just to save anyone wasting their time - there''s really no point in watching
    the "Meet the Experts" recording on the AU website. This being a panel session,
    most of the questions and replies aren''t picked up in the recording. But if you
    want to listen to 60 minutes of mumbling then go right ahead :-).'

  body: 'Absolute JOY!!, I''ve been looking for the info Stephen created, without
    even knowing he did so.  This stuff is great!  I recommend it to any and everybody
    wanting to dive into Parametrics with AutoCAD.  Thank you so very much both of
    you.
