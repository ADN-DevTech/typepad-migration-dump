    The future is not in exposing the computer internal guts but is in hiding them
    and making them work for your average programmer. Your first example is madness,
    your second one is acceptable.'

    typing/late binding can be.


    In your first example (prefixing a layer name) you reference the layer''s property
    3 times (2 reads and 1 write). Of course, if one understands the overhead of each
    dynamic invocation, they would probably also understand the importance of minimizing
    them, which in the case of your example would mean storing the layer name in a
    variable and operating on that, rather than the Name property directly.

    Given the purpose of this particular code, you''re likely to hit limits on the
    number of layers in a drawing before you see performance issues. But if you see
    a noticeable lag, feel free to use static typing.

    It would be impossible. Without an instance, there is no way to know what the
    actual type is, and without knowing the type, there''s no way to reflect on its
    members. That''s just the nature of the beast.'

    I like to think that someone might find a way to at least provide IntelliSense
    for cases where types can be inferred, in some way (constructors and functions
    that return objects of a specific type are candidates, for example).


    It might not be complete (or consistent), but it''d be something.

  body: "The problem there is that 'dynamic' can mean more than just 'duck typing'\
    \ or 'late binding' to a statically-defined set of properties, because the set\
    \ of properties for each instance of an object could be dynamic as well, meaning\
    \ that some instances of a given type of object can have properties that other\
    \ instances of the same type don't have (just like the 'per-instance' properties\
    \ that can be defined for the OPM).\n\n'Dynamic' could also mean that when you\
    \ try to assign a value to a property that currently doesn't exist on an instance,\
    \ rather than getting an error, the instance might just say \"hmmm, that property\
    \ doesn't exist - Ok, let's add it now\". The System.Dynamic.ExpandoObject is\
    \ a good example of that. It's essentially just an IDictionary of name/value pairs\
    \ that exposes the values as dynamic properties whose names are the keys. That\
    \ lets you add new properties to an instance at runtime, on a per-instance basis.\n\
    \nWhile the 'dynamic ObjectId' is a novel idea, I think its usefulness is limited\
    \ given the heavy dependence most have on IntelliSense. \n\nAnd, I think there's\
    \ other, far-better ways to leverage dynamic programming in AutoCAD's managed\
    \ API.\n\nFor example, IDynamicMetaObjectProvider can be used to expose AutoCAD\
    \ block reference attributes, or AutoCAD dynamic block properties as dynamic properties\
    \ of the BlockReference managed wrapper, that can be referenced in code (realistically,\
    \ they'd be instances of some dyanmic object that itself would be a property of\
    \ the BlockReference class, to avoid name collisons with statically-declared properties).\n\
    \nThose applications of the 'dynamic' keyword would be useful in strongly-typed\
    \ AutoCAD programming as well."

  body: 'I agree: as I mentioned in the post, the lack of IntelliSense (which I''m
    not expecting to be addressed anytime soon) is going to be a limitation for many.
    This could be mitigated - as for other dynamic environments - by increasing the
    discoverability of the language by some kind of REPL, but it still won''t be suited
    to many people. Which is fair enough - there''s no requirement to use it.


    Your suggestion around block attributes is interesting. It''s not clear this is
    a "far-better" use of dynamic programming than the base ObjectId exposure, but
    it''s certainly interesting. It reminds me of the work that the F# team has done
    on Type Providers, which might be another approach for navigating the AutoCAD
    drawing structure.


    By the way - is that you, Tony?
