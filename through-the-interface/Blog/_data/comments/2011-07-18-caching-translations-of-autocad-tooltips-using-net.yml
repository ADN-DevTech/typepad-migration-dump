  body: 'Just for information, I like to let .Net take care of writing my XML by serializing
    a class.  While you don''t normally break examples down into classes, I thought
    this was a good time to mention that for readers benefit.  Here''s a link for
    a good sample of serializing classes with .Net.

  body: 'Absolutely - under normal circumstances that''s exactly what I''d have done.


    In this scenario there isn''t really a runtime structure needed for the translations:
    they just get placed into AutoCAD''s UI and stored to disk. Adding a class and
    using a collection for the translated strings would have added unnecessary development
    and runtime overhead.


    But thanks for raising this - it''s certainly worth pointing out to everyone.
