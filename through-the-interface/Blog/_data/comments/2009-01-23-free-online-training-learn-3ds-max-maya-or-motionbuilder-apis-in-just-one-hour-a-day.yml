  body: "Hello Kean:\nFor the PlineJig (see your blog - November 17, 2006, Advanced\
    \ jigging with AutoCAD .NET - adding keywords),if you set the width to non-zero,as\
    \ below:\n\n      public void AddDummyVertex()\n\n      {\n\n        // Create\
    \ a new dummy vertex...\n\n        // can have any initial value\n\n        Polyline\
    \ pline = Entity as Polyline;\n\n        pline.AddVertexAt(pline.NumberOfVertices,\
    \ new Point2d(0, 0), 0, 0.5, 0.5);\n\n      }\n\nNow,the jig image will disappear.You\
    \ can zoom in the window.Is there any way to solve the problem?\n\nThank you!"

  body: 'Hello AZ,


    There is a way - don''t set the vertex width to non-zero. :-)


    Setting segment widths can be tricky (and beyond the scope of the sample I provided).
    I suggest posting your question to <a href="http://discussion.autodesk.com/forums/forum.jspa?forumID=152">the
    AutoCAD .NET Discussion Group</a> or to <a href="http://adn.autodesk.com">ADN</a>
    (if you''re a member).
