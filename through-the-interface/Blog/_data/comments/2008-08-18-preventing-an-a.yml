  body: "Hi Kean. \n\nAnother nice example and if you don't mind, a helpful tip: \n\
    \nYour code is handling events continuously, though it would seem that they only\
    \ need to be handled while the EXPLODE command is running. \n\nJermey's sample\
    \ in another post (rolling back changes to commands) demonstrates a best practice,\
    \ which is to only monitor the CommandWillStart event continuously, and begin\
    \ handling all other relevant events when the command(s) of interest start, and\
    \ stop handling them when the command ends. Doing that minimizes event overhead,\
    \ which can be somewhat expensive during 'command-intensive' user scripting."
