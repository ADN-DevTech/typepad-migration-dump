  body: If you take the results and simply print them on a sheet of paper, how good/bad
    is the 3D effect if you set the paper on a table and look at it from the correct
    angle?

    I have an app at the Exchange (STSC_Projective2d) that uses a more 2d approach
    to this sort of projection.  That is to say, the process is a bit more 2D oriented,
    but the coding methodology behind the UI employs some very traditional perspective
    creation techniques, i.e., Vanishing Point, Vanishing Line (Line at Infinity),
    etc.

    Here is a link to the App:
