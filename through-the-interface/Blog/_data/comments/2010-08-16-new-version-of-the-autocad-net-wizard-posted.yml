  body: 'I''m probably not best-placed to comment, as I don''t use the tool myself.
    Here is <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2009/06/a-new-project-wizard-for-autocad-net-development.html">some
    commentary</a> from me on the initial (pre-)release of the tool, in case that
    helps.

  body: 'Wouldn''t install for me on Win 7 x64 with AutoCAD 2010 & 2011. The VBA enabler
    is also installed for both of those, as are the ARX toolkits  Also, curiously
    wouldn''t repair or uninstall. It gave the same errors from the listing in add/remove
    programs, which would seem to indicate the installer didn''t crash very gracefully.
    That entry shouldn''t be there.

    This probably isn''t the place to look for answers but the Internet is a very
    big place and Autodesk often hides its answers very well.'

  body: Solved. After much frustration I found it was "blocked" in much the same way
    that CHM files are blocked when you copy them from another computer. To unblock
    it, right click - Properties - down at the bottom there is an "unblock" button.
    After I unblocked it the installation went fine. I hope this helps someone out
    there.

    This is "as designed". The installer makes use of a VBScript file, and so needs
    to run in this way. This is documented in the Wizard''s ReadMe.
