  body: Wind drag would cause the penny to reach a terminal velocity (basically the
    fastest it could go). It would definitely hurt anyone unfortunate to be hit by
    the penny but wouldn't fracture their skull as the myth claims.

  body: 'Kean,

    Small point of grammar: "unique" cannot be qualified, ie it is binary. Unique
    or NotUnique. "pretty unique" or as often heard in the media "very unique" is
    incorrect. The only exception is "statistically unique" as in a GUID.

    Regards from the Dept. of Usless Info.'

    [It seems there''s a school of thought that admits this particular usage case
    isn''t such a dreadful crime, at least: <a href="http://grammar.quickanddirtytips.com/modifying-absolutes.aspx]">http://grammar.quickanddirtytips.com/modifying-absolutes.aspx]</a>
