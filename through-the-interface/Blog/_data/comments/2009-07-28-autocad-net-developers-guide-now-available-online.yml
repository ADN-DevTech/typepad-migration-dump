    this looks like a fine piece of documentation / help - I''m looking forward to
    having a closer look at it, thanks for the link and thanks to the folks, who wrote
    the documentation and of course also to the folks, who had the idea to create
    an API documentation that way.'

  body: 'Cool!

    Will this guide be only available as an online resource (and we have to wait until
    AutoCAD 2011 for it to ship with the help) or will it be made available for download
    already now? Or can it be downloaded already and I just didn''t see it?

    Kind regards, Stephan'

    You''ll find more and more of our product documentation is also finding its way

    is certainly on the list of topics to cover in due course.

    Please consider publishing this as a PDF.


    Or fi anyone knows of a good web snake utility that till allow me to do this myself,
    I''d love to know about it.'

    I''ve passed on your feedback.


    By the way - I''ve used a tool called <a href="http://www.httrack.com/">HTTrack</a>
    to make offline copies of my blog. It creates HTML, rather than PDF (I''m not
    sure how you''d automatically map non-linear content into a linear document structure
    - perhaps there are clever tools out there that do this).

  body: 'Hi Kean,


    Thanks a lot for your great work in this blog. This blog as well as the video
    & the new "AutoCAD .NET Developer''s Guide" saves a lot to time for us. Please
    consider at least publishing "AutoCAD .NET Developer''s Guide" as a chm document
    like other ObjectArx docs. It will be a great help for those who don''t have internet
    full time. Also its easy to print from chm.


    I have one more suggestion to Autodesk in general. I had test used new Office
    2010. MS had made it stunning fast. Pls adopt the same technology for AutoCAD
    ribbon, and make AutoCAD 2011 a speed buster.


    Thanks again Kean

  body: 'Hi Shijith,


    If you want local HTML code, I suggest HTTrack (see above for the link). And for
    printing the PDF is on its way, by all accounts.


    We''re continually measuring and optimizing application performance: if a foundation
    technology becomes available we can effectively use to improve performance (without
    compromising quality) then I have high hopes that this will happen (assuming there''s
    a genuine user problem and there isn''t an incompatibility with our existing implementation).


    Something else to bear in mind: not everything MS does in a particular release
    of their own products is immediately available and usable externally, of course,
    so there can be a lag.


    Regards,


    Kean
