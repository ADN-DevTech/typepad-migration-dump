    It turns out attendance wasn''t far off expectations - 76 attended out of 110
    registered - but it was a *really* big room. :-)  I actually enjoyed the more
    intimate Q&A that we had with a small group, in truth.


    Also, the fact it was recorded means that so many more people will end up being
    able to watch it than would have fitted in the room, which is great.


    BTW - I''ve spent the weekend so far in bed and still have a strong fever, so
    I''m almost certainly going to cancel my trip to the Munich DevDay (not sure if
    you were planning on attending that, too).

    I was a bit stressed writing the post: you only get 45 minutes of free wifi in
    Heathrow and so was a bit up against it. :-S

    BTW - your comment ended up in my spam folder. Typepad''s algorithm seems to be
    getting more and more aggressive. :-S


    Have a great holiday break,
