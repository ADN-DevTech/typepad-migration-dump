  body: 'I''m little suprised on fact that CAD was written for flash. In fact, I was
    dissapointed because HTML5 in new and hot tech. Entire CAD application could be
    based on HTML5, drawing canavas, storage, browser 3D support..


    In the future, every mobile device will fully support HTML5.


    It would be interesting to see Mapguide development because HTML5 is made for
    web GIS apps.'

  body: 'HTML5 just wasn''t where it needed to be when Project Butterfly was first
    developed (and arguably isn''t there, even now). It will come, but in the meantime
    a more pragmatic approach is needed if you want to support existing customers.

  body: 'OK, HTML5 (let''s call it H5) wasn''t there for average user but for developer
    it was. Project butterfly was (and maybe still is, I''m not sure) in bet phase.
    IF user must have flash player to open Butterfly, why not insist on lastest browser
    version (except MS IE)?


    Time goes by and even MS confirms H5 support in IE9 (release date should be before
    new year).


    Look at demos on this websites <a href="http://<a href="http://raphaeljs.com">raphael</a>">http://raphaeljs.com">raphael</a></a>
    and this super cool <a href="http://www.sencha.com/blog/2010/07/20/html5-family-css3-ads-versus-flash-ads/">animation
    comparison between flash and H5</a>, I don''t really beilieve that ADSK dev team
    did not seriously thinking about H5 as a main framework for future cloud apps.'

    Its data is extracted and hosted in the cloud, and the AutoCAD WS client downloads
    this data as needed.

  body: So This is more like Youtube for architects!  I do not have the option of
    saving dwg files by myself as to be opened by  Flashplayer.  What is great about
    dwf is that your client can review a drawing by just having the viewer and it
    is very easy.  If Autodesk would do the same thing that a dwg files being saved
    and viewed as a flash file, they would have made the entire engineering firms
    of the world happier!
