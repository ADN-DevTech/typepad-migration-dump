  body: 'Good question - I don''t yet see the project live on Labs, though (which
    is why I linked to the article from my post).


    You may want to ping Scott Sheppard by email, Twitter or Facebook (his contact
    info should be somewhere on <a href="http://labs.blogs.com">his blog</a>).

  body: As the Inventor Publisher technology preview on Autodesk Labs creates content
    for Firefly, it seems only natural that we would make that available; however,

  body: 'I don''t know of an application that generates web content from a DWG/DWF
    with this capability.


    You might embed Design Review in a web-page, which will give you per-object properties.
