    On my last projects, I used groups extensively and did not experience performance
    issues apart from the groups dialog box.  Unnamed groups helped to overcome this
    problem

    Sometimes they are much more clear and objective than a bunch of code lines.

  body: I use the heck out of groups. I had performance become an issue once when
    I had a bazillion empty groups in a block that had been insert multiple times.
    A quick purge of the offending block, using one of the 'purge empty groups' lisp
    routines and everything was snappy as ever.

  body: 'hi Kean,

    i''m trying to find some effective way to store SelctionSets, i was thinking about
    groups, but i need the possibility of overlaping entities

    the group is created using ObjectIDs, but how does it retain when session ends?
    does it convert the oIDs to Handles somehow, when the drawing is closed?'

  body: 'Hi Matus,


    You can store ObjectIds for objects inside a drawing (such as inside an XRecord
    in a dictionary): these are ultimately memory pointers (and so transient in nature),
    but AutoCAD remaps them when it loads a drawing. So they will be consistent within
    the context of a drawing.


    If you need to cross drawing boundaries, then you''ll need handles.

    Thanks a lot.'

  body: 'Interesting view of groups vs. blocks. To throw another entity conglomeration
    practice into the mix: Mechanical Structure (AutoCAD Mechanical). I love working
    with structure but it is VERY buggy. To the point where I need to abandon it for
    core AutoCAD technologies. HOWEVER, I don''t want to leave the benefits of Structure
    behind. GROUPS have an "easy-in easy-out" editing ability similar to structure,
    where BLOCKS have the ability to be have multiple references "change once, update
    many". Any thoughts about how .Net can help with editing blocks in a similar way
    to groups & structure?

    Sorry - this isn''t a forum for support, and your question doesn''t apply to this
