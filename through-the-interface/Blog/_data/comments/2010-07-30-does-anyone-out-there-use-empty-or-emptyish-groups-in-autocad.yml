  body: It would be great to have the option to explode multiple groups at once, and
    even better to be able to see the No. and type of entities in a group before you
    explode it. Once expoloded, the empty groups could be cleared up with the 'PURGE'
    command...

  body: We use a tool called AutoXLSTable that can have only one item (usually a polyline)
    in each group - it's functionality is used to create a Bill of Materials.

  body: 'Hi Stephen,


    I don''t think they''re unnamed groups. (It''s because they have names that the
    program can find and count/measure them.)


    Thanks for the heads-up though.


    Cheers,


    Alex.'

  body: 'I have an old but important routine that attempts to process objects and
    in the event an object cannot be processed, it places that object in a group.
    At the end, it informs the user about the group so they can decide what to do
    with those objects. (There''s just one group for all failures, not one group per
    object). The group could contain just one object if only one can''t be processed.
    It''s a named group, though, so purging empty or single object unnamed groups
    wouldn''t have an effect here.
