    This does not work on polylines for me though. I have created 2d and 3d polylines.
    I know there is (used to be) LWPolylines -- is that what we''re supposed to use,
    and what command creates them?'

    as numberOfVertices, etc..


    Please excuse my ignorance! I use AutoCAD all day every day but apparently don''t
    know how to create a polyline!'

    Yes, this code only currently supports optimized (aka lightweight or new-style)
    polylines - objects of class Polyline. It culd be extended to support old-style
    polylined (objects of class Polyline2d and Polyline3d), but that is left as an
    exercise for the reader.


    To create optimized polylines you can set PLINETYPE to 1 or 2 and use the PLINE
    command, or use CONVERTPOLY to convert your old-style polylines.

    So I was backwards in thinking LW Polylines were "old style"! Don''t know when
    I would have ever changed PLINETYPE to 0, but I have been trying to get polylines
    to snap to themselves (actually to extend a polar extension of points already
    drawn), an ability which seems to have been lost in v2007, and I may have changed
    it some time during that.


    Thank you very much for the (very rapid) response, and thank you again for this
    very informative blog.


    Thanks to you, my exploration continues!'

    Working through the initial Labs pointed to by this post will help you understand
    more about building a .NET application for AutoCAD. You will need to use some
    version of Visual Studio, by the way.
