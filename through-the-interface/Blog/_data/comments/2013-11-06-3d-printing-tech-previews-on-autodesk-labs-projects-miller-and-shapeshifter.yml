  body: 'Thanks for the headsup on Project Shapeshifter.

    I haven''t been able to get it to work on my older Macbook Pro. I''ve been in
    contact with Scott Shepard at Project Shapeshifter. He''s been very prompt with
    replies, but I still can''t get an "Accept Terms window or starting template to
    appear. He said the terms window shouldn''t come up once I have the cookies, but
    I have them and still no luck. I had fun on a PC though making a vase. I really
    like Project Shapeshifter.


    Thanks again,


    Don Bancroft'

    The good news is that you''re in touch with the right person (Scott) so hopefully
    it''ll get worked out.


    It works find on my own 2010 MacBook Pro, FWIW. I tend to use Chrome rather than
    Safari for native OS X web-browsing.
