  body: I've had the same type of chat session with represenatives from my cable company.  Maybe
    there really is software out there doing this?

  body: 'Yes, it''s almost certainly a human-computer hybrid of some sort (perhaps
    an evolutionary step for us all, we''ll see).


    On the plus side they were able to resolve my issue, it''s just the experience
    was surreal. And the fact that it was so interesting at an abstract level made
    it much more worthwhile than the whole phone queue thing (I''d actually just been
    navigating such a system for 10 minutes before getting to the point I could "press
    0 to speak with an operator", only to find everyone offline for Veteran''s Day
    :-S).


    My assumption regarding the chat was that the human operator was provided with
    a number of canned responses (suitably randomised with synonyms and possibly the
    odd typo) from which they could choose the most appropriate one to (optionally)
    customise further. The fact there were a number of consecutive, contradictory
    responses made me assume the operator had <a href="http://www.macmillandictionaries.com/wordoftheweek/archive/060403-fat-finger-syndrome.htm">fat
    finger syndrome</a>.


    While fun the first time I''d hate to have to do this every day, I have to say.

  body: 'Hello Kean,


    Since this blog is blocked in China, and maybe some other countries, Is it possible
    to feed the whole post content in RSS so that it can be read in some rss reader
    such as google reader?


    Thanks much,

    Layman'

  body: 'Hello Layman,


    I originally did post full RSS content for my blog - back in the early days -
    but switched to a summary + link fairly quickly: it''s considered inappropriate
    to have RSS feed files spanning multiple megabytes (which could often be the case
    given the amount of content on the majority of my posts), plus I have a tendency
    to only see (and fix) certain typos once the posts are live.


    I know this isn''t ideal for China, but perhaps you can find another way to get
    the content, such as using Firefox + <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/5833">TOR</a>,
    which I''ve been told works (albeit very slowly).


    Regards,


    Kean
