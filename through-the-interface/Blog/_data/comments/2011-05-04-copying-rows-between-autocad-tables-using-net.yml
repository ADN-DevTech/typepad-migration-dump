  body: 'Hi,there!

    I''d like to ask a favor that how could I get the extents of a MgCurveString object
    in Civil3D.

    I had found some information that the MgCurveString object had a member called
    Boundary(), but this member could not gave me the perfect extents of MgCurveSting
    object sometimes.

    Do you have any other way to fit my problem?

    Thank you very much.

    Tomans.'
