    years old (emulated) system they have so many memories of.


    Added the book to my still-to-read list - thanks for that and also for mentioning
    the blog and the RetroPie script!'

  body: FUSE under terminal has joypad support. Just install the package fuse-emulator-sdl
    (Tip:F1 menu. To configure joypad, select Sinclair 1. In the game, select keyboard
    and redefine keys). Welcome :)

  body: "Thanks Kean! I still have a working ZX Spectrum (48k RAM model) - it was\
    \ my first Home PC. \nToday, my 7 yr old gets to use my iPad without much effort...click,\
    \ pay, boom - the games are there to use in few minutes.\nWith the 'Speccy', I\
    \ had to venture to one store in downtown to get the games and software, get home\
    \ and then load them using an audio tape deck! Yet, I enjoyed every minute of\
    \ it!"

  body: 'Hi Rohit,


    It does make a difference - the anticipation heightens the gaming experience,
    IMO.


    I''ll post next week on how I''ve managed to load games into a physical Spectrum
    as MP3 via an iPod, in case.


    Cheers,


    Kean
