    What about VS2010 compatibility with AutoCAD 2009, 2010 and 2011 in regards to
    both .NET and C++ SDK?


    Any significant advantage over VS2008 in terms of AutoCAD applications coding
    and debugging?

    I''m yet to install it, myself. Perhaps others can chime in with their opinions
    and experiences.


    From a compatibility perspective you should be just fine if you''re using .NET
    (although there may be things you need to do if you''re targetting .NET 4 - I''m
    not sure about that), but clearly you can''t use it for ObjectARX development.

    It is annoying to keep all flavors of VS installed or use some unsupported techniques

    Maybe in VS 2020... :)

    I have received two errors (apparently errors related to the Wizard while converting

    1) UNICODE,_UNICODE definitions disappeared

    2) _AFXDLL is now required (no clue why)

    3) Changed the "Platform Toolset" to v90


    After that, it did compile ok.

    Have opened it inside both AutoCAD 2010 and 2011 and...voila! Worked like magic!


    How cool is that??? :)


    I have used:

    VS 2010 Professional Trial version

    ObjectARX 2010

    Windows 7 Ultimate - x64 English

    AutoCAD 2010 x64 English

    2012 you need to turn the environment variable FIBERWORLD to 0 (it´s read only)

    to the change take place. Reload Autocad and then you can debug the code in the
