    What''s interesting is that you''re basically asking for a DXF-code manipulation
    capability that''s pretty fundamentally at odds with the concept behind ObjectARX
    and .NET: having an OO API to AutoCAD lets us get away from working with implementation-specific
    group codes. The "right" fix to your problem would (IMO) be to expose the property
    you''re looking for via ObjectARX and .NET (assuming it''s not there - I haven''t
    looked into the specifics).


    I''d also suggest it makes more sense to develop functionality when it''s needed
    to address scenarios that are strategically important, rather than only when minor
    bugs in existing (and frankly not at all comparable) capabilities are ironed out.

    \ exposing object instances (I mean as Acad.Application or \"MyCadApp\" for instance),\
    \ requires developing a js proxy code (as Javascript Shaping Layer is) and a set\

    \ by the use of TypeScript (*)\n - The native stub implementation, it is actually\
    \ a set of \"flattened\" methods (as 'Ac_Application_activedocument_addobjectreactor'\
    \ I found in Autodesk.AutoCAD.js) that de-serialize args an relay calls to wrapped\

    In a nutshell: write-once, use-anywhere AutoCAD applications. For now it''s Windows
    desktop-centric, but we''re hoping it''ll be possible to expose this API on other
    desktop as well as web and mobile platforms, too.

    BTW - we don''t have plans right now to extend the object model for actual drawing
    database objects, right now. The idea is that JavaScript applications will use
    custom graphics (jigs, transient graphics) to capture user input and then launch
    commands to generate the db-resident geometry. I''ll definitely also be looking
    at this area more in the coming weeks.

    But I have''t been involved in discussions around the plan for OEM, so there''s
    a lot I don''t know.


    You might try checking in via ADN - Fenton would know, I''m sure.

    interesting stuff indeed. Mainly with automated QA in mind, we''ve recently implemented
    an IPC meachnism (within AutoCAD) using marshalled JSON, connecting our test controllers
    and all to-be-tested applications (via JSON-over-HTTP or JSON-over-ProtoBuf and
    a broker). I''ll have a look at the JS API. Maybe there''s some overlap that we
    can leverage.


    Cheers'
