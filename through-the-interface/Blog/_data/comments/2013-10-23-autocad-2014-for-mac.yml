  body: 'but no .net API? I''m asking, I do not know.

    I have not played with the .net ports on mac, curious how that works.

    I think the nearest competition will be Bricscad, which runs on linux also. Wonder
    how they will do things.


    This is a good time to ask this question: Who does Autodesk see as its main customer
    base? Is it more the users, or more towards cad manager types that manage multiple
    users?

    Most industry cad managers I know say its the former. These things impact marketing
    and choice of what features to implement. Guess which crowd is making the purchasing
    recommendations though? Curious what your impression is.'

  body: 'No, no .NET on OS X. There are indeed ways to partially get there (Mono being
    the main one), but that''s not the direction we''re heading.


    I''d really hate to answer the "who''s the customer?" question on behalf of Autodesk,
    as I honestly couldn''t say. Firstly it''s not my place (or area of expertise),
    but also because of the diversity (and continuing evolution) of our business.


    But yes, the people that are engaging with our customers in order to gather their
    feature requests must have a better idea of who they''re targeting said features
    at (and I''d say that both constituents you''ve mentioned must rank highly, of
    course).

    Sorry, could not resist.

    Thx for your replies!'
