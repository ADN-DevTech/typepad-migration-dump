  body: 'Chuck,


    I''d like to say that the choice of flags was consistently driven by the needs
    of each jig, but it''s also possible that the specifics may have varied because
    a) that''s what seemed logical to me at the time, b) that''s what worked when
    I tested it or even c) it came from a snippet that I picked up from somewhere
    else (the least likely scenario).


    I unfortunately don''t have time to dig into the specific details, right now:
    you might try submitting a request to <a href="http://adn.autodesk.com">the ADN
    team</a>, if you''re a member, or otherwise posting to <a href="http://discussion.autodesk.com/forums/forum.jspa?forumID=152">the
    AutoCAD .NET Discussion Group</a>.
