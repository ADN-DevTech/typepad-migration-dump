  body: "My SensorTag communicates with a Raspberry Pi. \nI may use an attached Arduino(Gertduino)to\
    \ take the actual sensor readings.\nI aim to use the SensorTag as a giant mouse\
    \ to \"trace\" along the walls of an actual room. Alternatively it could be poked\
    \ into the relevant corners if the walls are straight.  The 'sketch line' function\
    \ in AutoCAD 360 would draw the line.\nMy current stumbling block is understanding\
    \ and implementing the sensor fusion that would use the acclereometer, gyro and\
    \ barometer to provide the relative position.\nI see at this stage you are considering\
    \ just the one sensor."

    Yes - just the accelerometer, although I plan on adding gyroscope + either Kalman
    or Complimentary filtering (we''ll see which makes most sense).
