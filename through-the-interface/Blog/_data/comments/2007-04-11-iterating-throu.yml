  body: While transaction.Commit() may be faster than Dispose() (I wasn't aware of
    this), it's still not a good idea.  If I remember correctly, this sets the documents
    modified flag which will cause a save prompt upon closing even though you didn't
    change anything.

    Here''s an excerpt:


    >>>

    ... there is a huge performance difference between Commit() and Abort().  So,
    when opening objects for read, you definitely want to explicitly call Commit()
    even though you didn''t really change anything.  As evidenced by a few test functions,
    Abort() should only be used under "duress" because of the performance hit.

    <<<


    A read-only transaction (even one that opens objects for write, but doesn''t modify
    them) will not set the database modified flag (DBMOD) when committed. It''s the
    individual "set" methods that call assertWriteEnabled(), forcing DBMOD to non-zero.'

    I would need the above code in VB to incorporate it in my VB.NET project. Could
    you perhaps provide it?

    Actually, I need to iterate through vertices in 3D polyline and extract coordinates.

    is there an elegant way of getting number of vertices for 3dpolyline? (like Polyline.NumberOfVertices

  body: 'Robert,


    The enumerator is generic - in that it returns objects of type System.Object -
    but my understanding is that these should in fact be ObjectIds of Vertex2d objects
    (for Polyline2d objects) or ObjectIds of Vertex3d objects (for Polyline3ds).


    But then I don''t spend much time iterating over old-style polylines, admittedly.


    Have you just tried dumping the object type, to see where/when they are of an
    unexpected type? You needn''t perform a static cast to a Vertex2d object, for
    instance - just open it as a DBObject and get the class name. I''d be interested
    to see under which circumstances you get non-Vertex2d objects.
