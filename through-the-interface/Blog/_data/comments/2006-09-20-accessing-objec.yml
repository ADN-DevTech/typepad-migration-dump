  body: 'Great,


    As GetType(), Handle(), etc. are Entity''s properties and Entity wrapper is derived
    from object it would appear at a PropertyGrid control?

    So it should accept something like:


    propertyGrid1.SelectedObject = ent;


    Have you tried that?

    Regards,

    Yes, this will show the various properties of a selected object... you would want
    to filter them in some way, though, as there are a lot of properties that no user
    will get any value from (one of the reasons we don''t automatically display all
    COM properties in the Property Palette).


    Cheers,

    My entity is Polyline. But I need read its fields from dataTable.

    If I use AutoCad Interface is: Map / Data Objects / Edit Data Object, but how
    I do it in vb.net or C#?

    Thank in advanced,

    Please post steps to reproduce the problem to the AutoCAD .NET Discussion Group

    at some other into material on the AutoCAD Developer Center: <a href="http://autodesk.com/developautocad).">http://autodesk.com/developautocad).</a>
    Assuming you''re asking about .NET, of course (you haven''t said).


    You would typically access the Line in the BlockTableRecord via a Transaction
    and then change its StartPoint (etc.) via object properties.
