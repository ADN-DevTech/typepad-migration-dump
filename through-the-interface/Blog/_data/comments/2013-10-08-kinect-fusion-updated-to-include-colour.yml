  body: Hi Kean, amazing stuff for sure. I keep wondering how close we are to some
    kind of consumer level lidar for things like mountain faces. All we have is lousy
    10 meter density USGS surface info, yet we finally have programs like infraworks
    that could handle finer detail surfaces. I want to scan the lakes I fish at in
    the Sierras (near Bishop on the 395 in California). What is the closest technology
    to doing that? I mean without HD scanners and full survey equipment? The gatewing
    drone seems the best so far.

  body: 'Hi James,


    Drones (probably octocopters - better at hovering to capture vertical surfaces)
    with high-res cameras are likely the best bet today. You&#39;d then use 3D reconstruction
    (e.g. ReCap Photo) to get a usable model.


    There have been interesting experiments in drone-carried lidar/laser scanning,
    but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s there yet for this kind of job.


    One day depth cameras may fit this need, too, but probably not structured light
    sensors such as Kinect 1.0 (more likely is a time-of-flight system such as that
    driving Kinect 2.0).
