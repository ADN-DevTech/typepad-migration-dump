  body: 'Hello Kean,


    Let me just start by saying you rock!  Your blogs have been tremendously helpful
    for our project.  I am new to RealDWG and have never used AutoCAD, but I do have
    a basic understanding of the dwg architecture.  I have a question that I can''t
    seem to find an answer for that is related to this post.  Basically, I want to
    fill an Entity with a solid color (instead of a gradient).  I''m guessing this
    is fairly easy but just not sure how to accomplish.  Can you please point me in
    a direction of a sample that would help us figure this out?  We are using VB.net
    3.5 with RealDWG 2010.


    Thanks!

    Matt'

    It is fairly easy: you can use a very similar technique to the above code, but
    rather than create a gradient fill you use the "SOLID" pre-defined hatch pattern.


    hat.SetHatchPattern(HatchPatternType.PreDefined, "SOLID");


    I haven''t actually tested this line of code, but I''m pretty sure it will work.

  body: 'Thanks for the follow up. :-)  I was able to get the gradient sample to work
    as well, which is actually pretty cool so I think we''ll go that route.  Your
    help is much appreciated!

  body: Nice post! Do you know if it is possible to define a 3-color gradient for
    an AutoCAD hatch entity?
