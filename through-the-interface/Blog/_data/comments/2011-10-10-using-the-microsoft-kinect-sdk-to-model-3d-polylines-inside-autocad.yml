  body: 'Hi Rashesh,


    I can imaging that extreme temperatures may cause a problem for a device using
    infrared (I haven''t looked into its operating parameters).


    This is way outside my field of expertise, I''m afraid.

    It''s possible there''s been a behaviour change since 2012 (as the dialog now
    has several more formats available).


    I''m checking in with the ADN team, to see if they can confirm the issue.

    I''ve posted a way to index point clouds programmatically in AutoCAD 2013 in today''s

    All being well, my next post will update the Kinect samples to use the same technique.
