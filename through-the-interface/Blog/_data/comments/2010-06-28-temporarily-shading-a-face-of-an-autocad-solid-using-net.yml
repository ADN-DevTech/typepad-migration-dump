    Thank you for another good example!!!


    It would be nice to we can add hatch without

    persistent objects into database.

    I am not sure is posible to draw hatch with

    worlddraw (if we want to override drawing for example

    some line with hatch)...


    Best regards,

    Danijel'

    Until someone comes up with a way, you might try reusing a single persistent polyline
    for the hatch generation (modifying the vertices each time).


    It should then be possible to use it repeatedly without drawing bloat (although
    I''d be more confident of this approach working from an InputPointMonitor event
    than an overruled WorldDraw()).


    Regards,


    Kean'

    \        foreach (Point3d vert in verts)\n        {\n          Point2d pt = vert.Convert2d(plane);\n\
    \          hatchLoop.Polyline.Add(new BulgeVertex(pt, 0));\n        }\n...\n \
    \       hat.AppendLoop(hatchLoop);\n\nSetting the type of the new HatchLoop to\
    \ Polyline constructs a new empty BulgeVertexCollection exposed through its Polyline\
    \ property, and then you just add points to that.\n\n(At least, that's working\
    \ for me in the DrawableOverrule stuff I'm messing with...)"
