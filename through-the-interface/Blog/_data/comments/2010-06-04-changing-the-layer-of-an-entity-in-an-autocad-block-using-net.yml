    Glenn Ryan also dropped me a quick email about the Linq option. I''ll be making
    the next version more elegant from this one respect, at least. :-)

    Here is what I've done - hoping someone could point out where I've gone wrong:\n\
    \n1) Installed Visual Basic Express Edition\n2) Created a class library and referenced\
    \ \"acdbmgd.dll\" & \"acmgd.dll\"\n3) Copied and pasted the code above and saved\
    \ it under my project as \"Class1.vb\" \n4) Used Kean's advice for debugging with\
    \ Express Editions (which is here: <a href=\"http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2006/07/debugging_using.html)\"\
    >http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2006/07/debugging_using.html)</a>\
    \ i.e. I've replaced \"select_nested.vbproj.user\" with Kean's code & updated\
    \ the filepath to suit my system.\n5) I've set the Command Line Argument for my\
    \ Project to \"C:\\Program Files\\AutoCAD 2010\\acad.exe\" and the working directory\
    \ to \"C:\\Program Files\\AutoCAD 2010\\\"\n6) Pressed F5 to debug.\n7) AutoCAD\
    \ 2010 opens and I type \"NETLOAD\" and select the .dll file in the project folder.\n\
    8) I type \"CNL\" on the command line and it says \"Unknown command \"CNL\". \n\
    \nWhat am I doing wrong?\n\nKnowing almost nothing about coding, am I just meant\
    \ to copy and paste the above code?\n\nDoes it need to be situated within other\
    \ code, or modified to run properly?\n\nThe error list for the project is 102\
    \ items long, and says \"Statement cannot appear outside of a Method Body\".\n\
    \nWould totally appreciate some pointers or advice.\n\nThanks,\nAdam the .NET\

    Have you made sure the project references to acdbmgd.dll and acmgd.dll are set

  body: 'Out of curiosity, as a by the by, does this Change Nested Layer script allow
    the user to shift-select nested entities, and apply changes across the selection?


    I am living for the day when Quick Select has a check box to "Include Nested Objects".
    Just imagine being able to sort out the innards of all your blocks as though they
    were all exploded already, without exploding them. As far as I understand, selection
    sets derived through Quick Select do not excompass entities within blocks. For
    instance, if you select text of a certain style with Quick Select, you do not
    pick up text of that style existing within blocks.


    Just imagine if this Select Nested capability could be integrated into the Quick
    Select tool. That would be oober useful. I want to be there at the opening ceremony
    of this functionality, cheering and popping champagne bottles with wild exhaltation.'

    It does indeed sound as though the project isn''t building properly. Does the

  body: 'This command uses ed.GetNestedEntity() in a loop to allow the user to select
    a set of single entities: you could probably support fancier selection approaches,
    but it would take some work (and was beyond the scope of the initial sample).


    I can imagine nested selection from Quick Select being very useful, but I can
    also see it would be quite a minefield to implement properly (there are deeper
    implications about allowing more general nested selection/modification that would
    need to be addressed to prevent user confusion). I do suggest submitting it for
    the AUGI wishlist.

  body: 'I downloaded and installed Visual Studio 2008.


    If I create a Visual C# Class Library, and paste the above code, I get no syntax
    error messages or highlighted code. The code seems happy. However, with this project
    type, I can''t reference "acmgd.dll" and "acdbmgd.dll" under the Project''s references
    tab; the set up is different. If I try debugging, with acad.exe as the startup
    object, and then netload, again, I can find no .dll assemblies.


    If I create a Visual Basic Class Library, I can indeed reference "acmgd.dll" and
    "acdbmgd.dll", under the References panel, however the code, once I paste it in,
    is highlighted all over as though there are syntax errors. For example, in C#,
    you use "using" and with a .vb you use "Imports". The .vb class doesn''t seem
    to like "using", and a whole lot of other aspects of the code.


    The error list consists of multiple instances of the following error types, totalling
    102 in all:


    "Statement cannot appear outside of a method body..."

    "Syntax error..."

    "Bracketed identifier is missing closing '']''..."

    "End of statement expected."

    "Declaration expected..."


    Are there a set of instructions somewhere on this blog, or elsewhere, for novices,
    which illustrate how to apply the various codes featured on Through the Interface
    to AutoCAD? Right now I''m pretty confused and definitely need some enlightening
    pointers.


    I''m sure I deserve a "least competent blog-user of the month" nomination for
    being this confused.'

  body: 'Hi Adam,


    The code posted is very much in C#: you would need to convert it to VB if you
    wanted to build it into a VB project (see <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2009/07/converting-between-c-and-vbnet.html">this
    post</a> for information).


    But it sounds as though you need to check the Visual C# Express documentation
    on adding project references: when I use Visual Studio I add project references
    by right clicking in the Solution Explorer window rather than from the project''s
    properties page.
