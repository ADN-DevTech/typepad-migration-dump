  body: so is SDI going to be gone in 2011? Or is it further away than that? Right
    now we are running old school (2005) and we are working on taking all of our lisp
    code and re-coding in .net 2008 with AutoCAD 2010. I am wondering how much effort
    I should put in to making it MDI complient at this point or do I have a couple
    of releases after 2010 before it will be required.

  body: 'Hi Rob,


    My advice would be to plan for MDI-compliance during your re-coding effort: there''s
    a high probability that SDI will be removed for the next major release (although
    a lot can happen between now and then).

    way: deciding to explicitly disable any SDI support; only doing what very little
    was needed to prevent a crash.'

  body: Microsoft is going away from MDI and opening a new document in Office applications
    open a new instance of Application. So why AutoDESK moving towards MDI support...?
    Whats the real benefit of MDI mode as from programing point of view its tough
    to maintain and porting from SDI to MDI mode need effort as well.

  body: 'It seems like we might be well served to identify SDI as a deprecated feature.


    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deprecation">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deprecation</a>


    WIKI: "In computer software or authoring programs standards and documentation,
    the term deprecation is applied to software features that are superseded and should
    be avoided. Although deprecated features remain in the current version, their
    use may raise warning messages recommending alternate practices, and deprecation
    may indicate that the feature will be removed in the future. Features are deprecated—rather
    than being removed—in order to provide backward compatibility and give programmers
    who have used the feature time to bring their code into compliance with the new
    standard."


    fyi - my fortune100 employer frowns on using my company email address for this
    post.
