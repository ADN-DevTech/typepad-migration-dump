    it''s funny to hear you complain about the "littel black box" on your CommandLine,
    since it''s the one that holds your chatting face ;-)


    Great and clear as always.'

  body: 'Hi René,


    Thanks for the chuckle. :-)


    Yes - I didn''t realise at the time that my face was obscuring that part of the
    screen (even if I had a small preview showing the output on my presenter''s console).
    I had a slightly different view of the screen, as a presenter, with additional
    information overlaid along the bottom.


    But yes - it was funny to see it in replay and realise what viewers would interpret.
    :-)


    Cheers,


    Kean'

    kind of defeats the purpose.  I like the face view a lot though, sure these details
    can be worked out.
