  body: 'Hi Danijel,


    That''s what I would have tried. You may want to try storing the ObjectIds of
    the FaceRecords you wish to erase, and opening them later on. But I admittedly
    don''t know very much about the PolyFaceMesh object: I''d recommend using SubDMesh
    (a much more modern object, and one we''re continuing to evolve), where possible.


    If this doesn''t help, please contact <a href="http://adn.autodesk.com">ADN</a>

    Sorry, I don''t. You will be able to build one by adding the source file to a
    project in Visual C# Express (you will need to follow some other steps mentioned
    <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2006/07/getting_started.html">here</a>).

    I enjoy a lot this triangulation code which creates Solid3d objects with a user-specified
    depth. What I need now is to have as result a Solid3d with a regular triangulated
    surface, a grid with a user-specified dimensions (x & y) and direction. Could
    you help me to have this?'
