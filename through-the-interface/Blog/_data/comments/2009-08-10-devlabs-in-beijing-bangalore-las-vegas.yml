  body: Kean, me email got bounced to the address in the post. I'd be interested in
    attending Devlabs at AU. I'm not sure if I'm going as an official attendee though.
    Would it be available to non AU attendees?

    Yep - made a mistake on the email address (missed a hyphen). Sorry about that
    - I usually double-check these things once they''re live.


    Anyway, thanks for letting me know of your interest: I''ll need to check on whether
    non-AU attendees would have access to the room (I believe so).

    It turns out this would be a room inside the AU firewall (a term I just made up),
    so some kind of conference pass would be needed.


    That said, we''ve scheduled a couple more DevLabs (in SF and the UK, once again)
    for February: you can already sign up via the <a href="http://www.adskconsulting.com/adn/cs/api_course_sched.php">API
    training schedule</a>, assuming one of those works for you.
