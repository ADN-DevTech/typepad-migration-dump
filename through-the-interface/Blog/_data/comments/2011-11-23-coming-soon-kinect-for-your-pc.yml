    There is also the Evoluce SDK:

    <a href="http://evoluce.com/en/software/sdk-for-kinect.php">http://evoluce.com/en/software/sdk-for-kinect.php</a>

    My hunch is:

    Gesture interface for PCs will become common once the software can better recognize
    hand and finger gestures.

    I can certainly imagine controlling AutoCAD in a "multi-mode" mode: left hand
    on pointing device, right hand pressing keys & making gestures, speaking voice
    commands simultaneously.:)


    Fascinating stuff.'

    I''m also definitely interested in seeing finger-level gestures implemented (although
    I''d prefer to be on the Microsoft SDK rather than OpenNI/NITE, after the prior
    pain I had getting everything to work with nKinect).
