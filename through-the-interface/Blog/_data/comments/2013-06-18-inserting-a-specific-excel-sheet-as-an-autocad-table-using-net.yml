    We''ve stopped using the Excel objects to read Excel files by using the Open XML
    SDK 2.0 for Microsoft Office.


    This way you don''t even need Excel installed on a machine to get to Excel data
    (in xlsx format).


    Takes a little more work setting up but sure is nice not having to worry about
    versions anymore.


    Thank,

    Mike'

    I have used this method to success except for one thing, I can''t specify a "range"
    of cells for the datalink. Trying to do the same ! separator followed by a range
    (e.g., A1:D10) it always throws a "eDataLinkBadConnectionString" error.


    I have made a little function that tells me the connection strings of the all
    of the present data links. Interestingly, if I manually create a datalink from
    Excel with a specified range instead of "Entire Sheet" it looks exactly as I was
    making my own connection string (e.g., C:\file.xls!Sheet1!A1:D10).


    This leaves me questioning why the heck I can''t make it do this behavior programmatically.'

    \ DataLink and it worked for me. Here's the modified code from the TFS command:\n\
    \ndl.ConnectionString =\n  ofd.Filename + \"!\" + sheetNames[pir.Value - 1] +\
    \ \"!A1:B8\";\n\nI'm working with AutoCAD 2014, in case.\n\nRegards,\n\nKean"

  body: 'Hi Kean,


    Nice post, as MikeR said about using XML in order to obtain data from Excel files,
    this is a link to a good MSDN  article on that: <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh370976%28v=office.14%29.aspx">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh370976%28v=office.14%29.aspx</a>
