  body: "What an awesome tool. Thanks!\nI did find a few issues.\n\n1. You mention\
    \ the aspect ration being maintained but when I stretch the dialog or the splitter\
    \ the image just stretches to fill the space which distorts it.\n2. You mention\
    \ the preview adjusting to the size of the selected item but I don't see that.\
    \ The preview always represents the full drawing window at the time of the clip.\
    \ If I'm zoomed out to the entire model (drawing) and copy a small part to the\
    \ clipboard, the preview shows the small part in it's relative size and location.\
    \ It would be more useful if the selected items filled the preview screen.\n3.\
    \ If my cursor is over the *grid* when I select an \"insert\" option from the\
    \ context menu the dialog does not release my cursor and the drawing window does\
    \ not become active until I click on it. It's odd that if my cursor is over the\
    \ preview when I select one of the insert options from the context menu everything\
    \ works fine.\n \nThe version number of the dll I'm using is 1.0.4.0."

    But I also think, that it''s more usable, if the preview area shows only the copied
    items, instead of the whole screen.


    And I found a bug. When I start the copy command and the palettes width is too
    large, I get an error because of the recalculation of the splitter distance.'

    I ended up spending a bit of time this weekend to implement an "auto-crop" of
    the preview image (more in today''s post). And in the process I came across the
    same bug and fixed it.

  body: 'Very nice tool indeed, I didn''t know the clipboard would contain a bitmap
    preview...


    Speaking of... I noticed that sometimes the Bitmap object returned by GetData("Bitmap")
    does not return anything. This often happens while copying blocks with attributes
    or dynamick blocks, but not always...

    I haven''t figured out why yet.

    Is something by design?

    Does it happen to anyone else?


    I also noticed that GetFormats() returns both ''Bitmap'' and ''System.Drawing.Bitmap''
    items.

    They seems to be just aliases, is that true or there is any difference?'

  body: 'I was made aware of the issue with blocks, but couldn''t reproduce it (but
    then I didn''t try with attributes). In the end I just changed the code to make
    sure we don''t try to process and use an empty bitmap.


    I haven''t looked into Bitmap vs. System.Drawing.Bitmap - although I did notice
    the two formats were available - I''m guessing they''re simple synonyms.
