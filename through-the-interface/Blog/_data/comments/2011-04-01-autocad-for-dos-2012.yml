  body: I hope that Autodesk has put effort into catering to the non-lisp/arx development
    community with this release beyond that done with the Mac version.  Embedded qbasic.net?

  body: Wow! Just what I've been waiting for! This thing's really going to FLY on
    today's hardware! But what a shame that all that performance is going to be offset
    by the terrible loss of productivity caused by the lack of a Ribbon. ;)

  body: Thank God! Finally a return to a stable and functioning version. Hopefully
    this will also mean a return to useful manuals, customer help that actually helps,
    and... oh, right. What was I thinking? ;)

  body: Seriously,though, the bad news is that 2012 drops the old DOS screen menu.
    It is/was far faster than the ribbon & toolbars (no fancy grapics) and is fully
    context-sensitive. It was built in the days before 3-button mice, so it automatically
    shifts to bring up all the context-menu stuff without having to right-click. I'll
    miss it.

  body: Bill, it's not totally dropped. You can REDEFINE SCREENMENU and then SCREENMENU
    1, but unless you're using the default menu you're going to have to do your CUI
    maintenance in an earlier release.

  body: Well, MS-Dos is the pioneer of all operating systems. I would love to see
    Autocad used here. It is more accessible and allows for faster reloading of all
    backups. Even without the use of a mouse, I would still prefer to use Ms-Dos as
    my working platform.

    when you wrote this, perhaps a case of fiction closer to reality! :-)
