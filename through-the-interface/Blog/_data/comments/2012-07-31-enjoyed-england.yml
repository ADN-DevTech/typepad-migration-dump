  body: 'Hi Kean,


    there are lots of minifig 3d models in the www, also free ones.

    Generally, I think LEGO is a sort of *haptic* CAD.

    A HaptiCAD ;-) without the need of a VR environment or a data glove.

    Not surprisingly, there were some collaborations between Autodesk and LEGO in
    the past.



    Cheers,

    Rudolf


    P.S.: What about merging your blog with the ADNDevBlog ?'

  body: 'Hi Rudolf,


    Thanks - I''ll keep trying to dig one up.


    I have to admit that I haven''t seriously considered giving this blog up to start
    contributing to the DevBlog(s). I''d be curious to understand more about the benefits
    you think there''d be in doing so (perhaps consolidated search?). Feel free to
    <a href="mailto:kean.walmsley@autodesk.com">drop me a mail</a> to continue the
    discussion.


    Cheers,
