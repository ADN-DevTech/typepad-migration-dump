  body: 'Hey Kean,


    This is brilliant! Congratulations! You really had me going there for quite a
    while, looking at the guardian article and starting to scratch my head. In spite
    of the foolnote ... oops, I meant footnote.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    No, but I''ve had a lot of people start following me (I can only hope they realise
    it''s a joke but are hoping to see me start Twittering anyway).


    I''ve had the account for a year or so but hadn''t really got around to doing
    much with it... perhaps it''s about time I actually started sending out a few
    tweets, after all. :-)
