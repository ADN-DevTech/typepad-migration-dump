  body: 'Hi csharpbird,


    Obviously - given the timing of their respective releases - no version of AutoCAD
    prior to 2011 was tested with version 4.0 of the .NET Framework. Depending on
    the specific version''s usage of .NET, it might work (as you appear to have found
    with 2007), but it doesn''t really surprise me you''d have trouble using .NET
    4.0 features with prior versions.


    As <a href="http://au.autodesk.com/?nd=class&session_id=5164">Albert said in his
    AU presentation</a>, AutoCAD 2010 may have had fixes in <a href="http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/ps/dl/item?siteID=123112&id=15074619&linkID=9240618">Update
    2</a> to enable .NET 4, but as the only reference in <a href="http://images.autodesk.com/adsk/files/autocad_2010_and_autocad_lt_2010_update_2_enu.htm">the
    ReadMe</a> is regarding a fix for an issue with ribbons "when .NET 4 is on the
    system" it''s not clear that that really enables the use of .NET 4 with AutoCAD
    2010.


    You should get a more comprehenesive answer via ADN, if you''re a member.

  body: I see that enhanced Visual LISP IDE is second on the list.  Why is LISP still
    being used so widely?  It should be abandoned or encouraged for users to abandon
    it.  As I read somewhere someone described coding in LISP is for people that like
    solving logic puzzles with code (not the problem you are solving, the code itself).  If
    you are new to development try read a LISP program, then try read a .NET program
    and tell me which is easier to understand and work with.  If you want an enhanced
    IDE, use Visual Studio.  This will allow development effort to go towards improving
    the API and adding additional ones instead of duplicating effort on writing IDE's
    (which is done already by Microsoft, is AutoCAD a drawing package or a programming
    IDE software? Why would you want it to be both? Why duplicate so much effort?)  I
    am new to writing code for AutoCAD and have been working with both LISP and .NET
    and .NET is hands down the way to go (As it may be apparent my experience as a
    new developer learning both API's has provided me with a slight bias).  I am sure
    I know the answer to this question since all the dinosaurs out there are holding
    up a horrible API, but is there any plans to take the focus off of LISP and useless
    duplication of effort?

  body: 'The "VLIDE Enhancements" item has jumped somewhat in this year''s survey,
    which is possibly just due to increased attention from a different community (Steve
    Johnson has <a href="http://www.blog.cadnauseam.com/2010/05/11/programmers-have-your-say/">specifically
    asked for LISPers to respond to the AutoCAD survey</a>, for instance).


    As you''ve stated, we are not in the development tool business, these days - and
    would prefer to rely on companies such as Microsoft or even on open source technologies,
    instead - but we also need to service the requirements of the existing community
    of people dependent on "legacy" development environments, or to provide migration
    tools to - or education on how to develop equivalent programming skills on - technologies
    that are continuing to evolve with our products.


    It''s a fine balance in terms of resource allocation, of course. I can certainly
    understand there are many LISPers who would like to see more development resources
    focused on enhancing the VLIDE. All of the input provided in these surveys is
    valuable to our various Product Management teams when deciding the right mix of
    focus for the coming releases.

  body: People that think VS is a replacement to the abilities LISP provides, do not
    understand the advantages of LISP.  Since it can be tested at the command line,
    its way easier to develop small macros and things with.  Also, the libraries of
    subroutines the LISP people have are tried and true, while .net code is still
    accumulating.  LISP and .net are not the same, and fit different skill levels
    and time availablities.  I can see the day when .net will be as convenient as
    LISP, but we are a ways out.  We do not even have VSTA in acad yet, and must shut
    down acad and run a new session almost every time you make changes and debug.  The
    practical implications of that and the .net learning curve divide LISP and .net
    by a large distance.   Autodesk is wise to maintain both to meet as much market
    segment as possible.

    Did final numbers for this survey come in?  It''s interesting to see each year
    the differences (and similarities) in what customers are looking for.  Thanks
    for keeping us up to date!
