  body: 'Hi Kean,

    What is the html/js engine used by AutoCAD? is it webkit  or Chrominium based?

    I''ve developed a while ago a feature in my application that injects COM objects
    in HTML based dialogs (IE activex based :( ) allowing js code to interact with
    my application. This feature was pretty cool, it brought power and simplicity
    of HTML/JS into my application, it even allowed a colleague - which originally
    had only a few skills in programming but was quite comfortable with HTML - to
    develop some very interesting features.

    I guess the Acad JS API will open Acad development to  new profile of programmers,
    that''s very nice!

    I however ask for the HTML engine used because we experienced a lot of issues
    regarding IE versions -as web developer are used to deal with- mainly CSS issues
    but also some more frustrating js or activex issues.

    As AutoCAD now exists on OSX platforms, I guess IE engine has not been envisaged.
    So, I hope I''ll be able to migrate my Com-based code to the new API (probably
    using .net), this would solve the issues we got with IE, unfortunately, I read
    your post on "AutoCAD 2014 for developers" and it seems the only way to extend
    the JS API is .net JavaScriptCallback or c++ acjsDefun(), not sure this allows
    me to inject full objects definitions into the JS engine.

  body: 'Hi Loic,


    We went with Chromium (which is itself WebKit-based, I believe), as its JavaScript
    engine (V8) is extensible.


    I''ll post more details soon, but hopefully that''s enough for now. We''ll have
    to see whether the extensibility model meets your specific (and no doubt fairly
    advanced) needs.


    Regards,

    Thank you for your answer


    I hope V8 extensibility model will be somewhat exposed, I just can''t wait to
    work with such a cool engine!


    Cheers,
