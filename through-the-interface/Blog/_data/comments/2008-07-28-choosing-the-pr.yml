    \nAs an ObjectARX developer my self, not long ago my answer would have been \"\
    ObjectARX, without a doubt\", but as we've seen the .NET API mature and now we're\
    \ having to consider interoperability with external .NET applications the choice\
    \ is becoming more and more difficult! \n\nSince we have few ObjectARX developers\
    \ the ability to leverage some of the C# knowledge we have elsewhere is a real\

    Actually source code (IP) security is another factor I could have listed, thinking
    about it: although it may be acceptable to use obfuscation tools rather than compiling
    to native code.


    And yes - mixed mode modules provide great interoperability opportunities, although
    I would tend to use them to expose interfaces from C++ that can then be used by
    C#/VB.NET programmers. Having a completely homogeneous C++ environment isn''t
    a path I''d recommend unless the domain in some way required it and the skills
    were readily available.

    I would add a comment regarding the use of C++. I have worked on a project over
    Autodesk MAP which is supposed to access an Oracle database selecting and/or posting
    some objects.


    The first try was to use a .NET database provider which works great for a small
    set of objects but was a pain for a huge number.


    We have then switched to OO4O which is a C++ Oracle database provider which is
    really complex but a thousand times faster than the .NET provider.


    In this case, the use of C++ in this part of the project was mandatory.


    So the end of the story is that you really don''t have one single magic API to
    use. A mix is welcome and you need to also consider other non-programming facts
    like team scalability, project cost, project development speed, code reuse, legacy
    APIs, etc.


    Good work Kean! :)'

  body: 'Hello,


    I write applications for Autocad Map and Civil3d platforms, mostly with ObjectARX.

    I would like to do more with .NET but so far the main reason preventing this is
    not having the NETUNLOAD command..


    With arx I can just arxunload and arxload the application for modifications in
    a second.

    But with .NET I have to restart the heavy environment and do all kinds of lengthy
    initializations before being able to try even small changes in code, this can
    take a minute or more..


    Maybe it is possible to create an utility, for development purposes, to unload
    a .net assembly from Autocad ?'

  body: Hi Kean, Some time has passed on this subject, I am interested to know if
    "it's still true that custom objects can only be implemented using ObjectARX (i.e.
    C++)"? Can or will Custom Objects be possible with C#? VS2010? Regards, Dale

  body: 'Hi Dale,


    Overrules are really the way forward. Admittedly they don''t cover some of the
    edge cases (such as when people actually want to stored custom binary data in
    a drawing), but the existing custom object mechanism will continue to be available
    to people prepared to handle the complexity of using it from C++.


    At this stage we have no plans to extend the capability to define custom objects
    to the .NET API (but then again - with all that''s going on in our industry -
    my crystal ball is looking increasingly murky, these days :-S).
