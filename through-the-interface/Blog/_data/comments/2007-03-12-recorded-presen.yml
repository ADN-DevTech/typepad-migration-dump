    The video color is strange.

    Is this video available to download at ADN web (can''t found it under Events page)?


    Thank you.

  body: 'Hi Fernando,


    Yes, the demos sometimes appear a little strange - in terms of colors - which
    seems to be because of the video codec used to create the recording. I don''t
    think downloading will help, but I will look into whether we''re making the presentations
    available as separate downloads.


    Thanks,


    Kean'
