    Ah yes - I used the code from <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2009/05/creating-demand-loading-entries-automatically-for-your-autocad-application-using-net.html">this
    post</a>, which I should have mentioned.


    You can include it in the project if you want the PYEXEC command to load the DLL
    automatically, of you can just remove the namespace and the call to RegisterForDemandLoading().


    Regards,


    Kean'

    Just a little note:

    Pyload, Pyexec not working in classic workspace (error message would be nice).
    but in with ribbon on it''s working as told.'

    You could probably modify the code to check for whether RibbonControl was null
    (which may or may not be the problem, as I can''t reproduce it) before setting
    the variable in the IronPython runtime scope.
