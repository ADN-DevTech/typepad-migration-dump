    very inserting topic, as usual ;). cant wait to see the implementation of it,
    and the possibility of this.'

    How cool is that?'

  body: This does sound really interesting - I wasn't aware that Photosynth could
    export the point clouds users create; is this something you'll be covering as
    a fore-word on the code you've written? (I would guess not, but perhaps you have
    a link to how to do it that you can share - or should I just <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTFM">RTFM</a>
    on Photosynth?)

  body: 'Very cool - thanks, Fernando.


    I''d seen the panoramas created using ICE appear on Photosynth.net - it''s good
    to know where they''re from and how they''re created.


    While the demos they showed in this clip creating clean 2D images from video are
    cool (as well as the other stuff, of course) I''m overall more interested in the
    creation of 3D content from 2D (which just feels like a bigger problem and with
    much greater consequences for our industry).


    I''m really looking forward to seeing point clouds created from video footage,
    at some point.

  body: 'That''s excellent news, I can see this approach being really useful for those
    times when you can''t get hold of the original plans for something. (and don''t
    want to start the model from scratch)


    Simply take a bunch of "Synthy" photos of whatever it is you''re trying to model,
    add them to Photosynth, download the point cloud, run it through your code and
    Voila! you have a 3D mesh to work on..?'

  body: 'Kean,


    Are the point cloud posted along the pictures created by the user itself or do
    the website use some tool to analyze the images and then generates an estimate
    point cloud for it?


    I remember AutoCAD 2011 demo with a point cloud made by a 3D laser scanner of
    Mandalay Hotel. In this case, it was really reach in details and amount of points.
    What I think is tricky is how to determine the depth distances from a single point
    which is the camera position.


    Very interesting subject anyway... :)'

    The "Voila" effect is what I''m trying to understand better. It is not that clear
    how the point cloud will be generated from the image set. I think it is not that
    simple as we would wish.'

    From a set of pictures that are taken from the same line (like driving by a building)
    you''d have a hard time determining depth, but if you take 10 pictures around
    an object from all the angles I think you should be able to determine the depth
    of the object, wouldn''t you agree?'

  body: Thanks Victor, you said it better than I could - I didn't mean to imply that
    "we" would be creating the point cloud ourselves. Some very clever people at Microsoft
    have already done that bit for us.<br><br> I've been tinkering with Photosynth
    myself this evening, and managed <a href="http://bit.ly/cxGh3P">this</a> from
    some old holiday snaps.<br><br> Granted, the point cloud on this isn't that great,
    but it does give a good impression of the mountains we were looking at, and it
    gives you an idea of what's achievable with a little more deliberate thought about
    the subject of the pictures.
