  body: I like how the plugin enhances the OFFSET command. I don't have to remember
    a new command! But is there a way to make it work if the source layer is locked?

  body: 'I''ve just given it a try, and it does appear to work if the object selected
    from the xref is on a locked layer. Or do you actually want me to make sure it
    doesn''t offset geometry on a locked layer (which is the default of the OFFSET
    command, from what I can tell)?


    I suspect I''m missing something here...

  body: 'I should have explained better the first time. I get "The object is on a
    locked layer." when trying to offset a line that is in an Xref and that Xref happens
    to be located on a locked layer. You are right though, if the layer that the line
    is on (in the Xref) is locked, the Offset command still works.
