  body: 'Hi Kean,


    Your classes look very interesting. I hope our schedules don''t conflict so I
    can attend them. The two classes I will be teaching, which your readers may be
    interested in are:


    <b>CP2654 - Automated Testing with the AutoCAD .NET API</b>

    <b>CP2657 - Programming AutoCAD with C#: Best Practices</b>


    Good luck in the football tournament, and have a great (well deserved) vacation.
    I look forward to seeing you in Vegas!


    - Scott'
