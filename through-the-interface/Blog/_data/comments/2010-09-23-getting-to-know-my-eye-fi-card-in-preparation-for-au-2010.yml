  body: 'Kean,


    Awesome review. You definitely do not need to share your photos online, or to
    any sharing site, if you don''t want to. You can just turn off web sharing, and
    leave the card in local-mode only. That''s absolutely supported.


    Once you have the card in loca-mode only, you can choose to have Relayed uploads
    ON or OFF. ON, means that even if your PC was off, the photos would go through
    the Eye-Fi Servers, stay there, and then, next time that you turn on your PC,
    the photos would come down to it, from our servers. It also means that if you''ve
    enabled open hotspots, and you''re at Starbucks for example, the photos will get
    to your PC, from Starbucks, and get relayed through our servers.


    If you turn Relayed Uploads OFF, the card and your PC will need to be on the same
    network (LAN) and the photos will not upload, unless the PC is on, and the card
    is online, through your secured or open in-profile network.


    So there really is no privacy concern, if people don''t want to have their photos
    shared.


    We''re from the camp that sharing is great, and that even archiving and backing
    up to the cloud -- is the smart thing to do. If you upload to Flickr, for example,
    and your photos are private, no one is seeing them, BUT, you''re building a backup
    of your photos, in case your hard drive will crash. So it''s a good thing :-)  That
    said, many people don''t want to have their photos on the net, and it''s totally
    up to them.


    Thx --


    Ziv.'

    ad-hoc. ad-hoc is super cool and convenient, because you don''t need to carry
    an extra router.


    But if you want to have the card in the audience, and you needed more range, I
    would recommend getting a solid N router, and you''ll get much more range.'

    \ I am certain to get a lot of fun from it. Did you install the adhoc finction\
    \ laptop /camera?\nI am loosing somthing out as it won't work for me.\nAnd yes\
    \ my card can do the adhoc as it is the pro-card.\nHow did you establish that?\n\
    \nWould you mind to give me a word of advice into this issue? \nThankx"

  body: 'Hello Jan,


    Yes - I''ve used the AdHoc mode. If you have the Pro card, then you should be
    able to, also.


    I followed the online instructions for <a href="http://support.eye.fi/how-to-set-up-an-ad-hoc-network/">setting
    up</a> and <a href="http://support.eye.fi/how-to-connect-an-eye-fi-card-to-an-ad-hoc-network/">connecting
    to the network</a>, and it all worked fine.


    Best regards,


    Kean'

  body: "I know this comment is a bit late... but I disagree with Ziv, vehemently.\n\
    \nI do NOT (I can't emphasize this enough) want Eye-Fi central servers storing\
    \ my pictures or my passwords, EVER.  Now, it is possibly the case that with Flickr\
    \ or other photo sharing sites that this is an unavoidable engineering issue for\
    \ 100% reliable service.  But I really, really strongly believe that there should\
    \ be an option for NOT turning that relay mode on, and making the card talk directly\
    \ to the service.  \n\nI'll listen to technical arguments about \"cloud\" services,\
    \ but I refuse to believe that you need to relay when sending to my FTP server.\
    \  What, please tell me, is the reason I should be giving some remote service\
    \ access to my FTP server?  And why does your widget on my Mac keep talking to\
    \ your systems in Hurricane Electric every minute or so, regardless of my use\
    \ of the EyeFi card?  I hate opaque security risks, and your product presents\
    \ a HUGE opaque security risk.  This is what I see when I look at my logins after\
    \ enabling upload via FTP:\n\neyefitemp   ftp      lrrr-int.eye.fi          Tue\
    \ Mar 22 02:26 - 02:26  (00:00)\n\nWHAT?! No, no, no.  Get out of my machines.\
    \  This is basically giving carte blanche to your staff to walk into my systems.\
    \  (\"But trust us!\")  I want to see the card talking directly to my server,\
    \ and if that doesn't work, NO RELAY.  Ever. EVER.  My passwords must stay in\
    \ my control, not yours.  If I choose to give you that ability - great.  But right\
    \ now this is a hidden security bomb that most users have no idea about.  \n\n\
    And you can't tell me that your sysadmins haven't ever seen the thousands of pictures\
    \ being streamed through your servers every day.  I would bet you large amounts\
    \ of money that there is a secret \"Best Of\" directory somewhere there with all\
    \ kinds of good stuff in it, but that's pure speculation.\n\nI've brought this\
    \ up before at EyeFi when I first got my card, but I suspect there is nobody there\
    \ who actually thinks this is a problem, so I'll air it publicly here.\n\n-----"
