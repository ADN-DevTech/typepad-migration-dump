  body: I really enjoyed your AU presentation. Extraordinary technology if we cast
    our minds back a few years. I'm busting to buy one, but can't quite find a reason
    except "intellectual pursuit". I sure don't need any more half-finished projects...
    Off topic, Congratulations on your new position. Regards, Dale
