  body: Sounds interesting! Looking forward to reading the rest of the series.  I
    can certainly imagine having the Leap act as an auxiliary input method, particularly
    for orbit, drag and zoom actions, but of course how it actually works in practice
    may be another matter.

  body: 'good post, I had not seen that device before.

    Seems to me this complicates the idea of placing program and data on a remote
    server, reffered to as the cloud by consumer lingo, as now you have this point
    could data of your hands that must be sent to that remote server. Given the trouble
    I have seen so far with gittery mouse cursor, and the hoops people have gone through
    to solve that, sending point clouds in real time seems 10x the problem. Any thoughts
    on that? I don''t think its a real issue, as companies will not turn over control
    of their software to a vendor, just curious what people at Autodesk think when
    they see this kind of device surface.'

  body: 'The local processing (the Leap Motion runtime) generates a fairly small set
    of data that apps use: they get hands with fingers, for instance, rather than
    having to deal directly with low-level point clouds. Whether or not the added
    latency of working with a cloud-based service gets in the way remains to be seen
    (lots of "cloud-based" services still maintain client-side components for UI implementation,
    anyway).

  body: 'Hi Kean,


    I totally agree with you on the fact that any use of hand gestures for any length
    of time it’s going to be more or less tiring, therefore discouraging the use of
    it.


    And I certainly can see some reasonable use for the device as you say it, for
    large, shared displays (BTW, I perceive it as a menacing alternative for the overly
    expensive SMART Board, at least in a future incarnation able to cover a greater
    volume), for weather presenters or as a complementary CAD device, replacing those
    costly 3D input devices like SpacePilot Pro and similar.


    But right now I have another question for you.


    Assuming that you own already this device, could you please say if it has some
    basic functionality out of the box, something like a mouse or a track pad, or
    one really has to start using the SDK in order to make any use of it?


    I was trying to find the answer on their forum, but everything concerning this
    issue seems to be very confusing momentarily.


    TIA,


    Constantin'

  body: 'Hi Constantin,


    It''s really a developer-focused tool, at this stage. There''s the Leap Visualizer
    - a standalone app that comes in the SDK - but that really just allows you to
    analyze the data coming from the device.


    I fully expect a basic OS integration to be provided either along with the Leap
    Motion controller or in their App Store, once live. To give you a feel, the 3rd
    post in this series does a very basic Windows Messages-level integration that
    should work with pretty much any Windows app.


    But, frankly speaking, if the Leap Motion is just used as a mouse replacement
    - without a higher-level, gesture-based integration - then it will fail: it''s
    far too tiring to use in this way. A mouse would be much better, as you can at
    least rest your hand on it (rather than maintaining some distance from the device,
    hovering over it).


    I hope this helps,


    Kean'

    Obviously, if this device would be used only as a mouse replacement, it would
    be downright ridiculous and useless :)


    My question was purely rhetorical, of mere curiosity :)

  body: As I recall from the early press on the Leap Motion device, it was envisioned
    as a way to provide a natural interface for drawing and sculpting. If developers
    are going to map its abilities into existing crippled interfaces, I don't think
    it will achieve its true potential. Assemble a system from an existing library
    of iMapped parts in AutoDesk Inventor using the existing UI. Now imagine that
    you can pick up those same parts in an environment that supports surface and fit
    constraints to objects and assemble them as if they were real -- with the added
    advantages of scaling, zooming, and relaxing surface constraints to put something
    inside that you forgot. This is where the Leap Motion interface will shine, but
    it requires re-engineering Inventor to get those benefits. If AutoDesk won't do
    it, somebody will.

  body: 'We''ll see how this plays out. Other work is going on in this area, as you
    might expect. The main target isn''t AutoCAD - this was a simple prototype to
    kick the tyres, despite its "crippled interface" (sigh).


    I love the whole Minority Report concept, too, but my personal sense is that it''s
    going to be for casual use only until the ergonomics are dealt with (probably
    via some kind of haptic feedback).

    P.S. No need for all the drama, by the way. It gets tedious.'
