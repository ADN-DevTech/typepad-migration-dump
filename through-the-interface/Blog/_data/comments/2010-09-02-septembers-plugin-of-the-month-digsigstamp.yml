  body: The plugin developed by Fenton and reimplemented by Stephen has proved to
    be very useful since it allows one to see the digital signing of an AutoCAD drawing.Its
    worth appreciating that you have made the code an open source so that one can
    fit it according to one's requirements.

  body: 'Truly,this plugin deserves to be the plugin of the month.I know that i am
    quite late but then also its true.In addition to its open code(that can be developed
    according to one''s requirements) it allows the digital signing of AutoCad files.Thats
    simply great.
