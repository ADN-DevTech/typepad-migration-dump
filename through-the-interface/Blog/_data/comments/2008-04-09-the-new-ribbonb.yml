    with 2009 is sketchy at best. I''ve downloaded the objectarx samples but they

    You will also need to migrate your code, as there are differences in the way AutoCAD

    I applied the first method in your article. Everything works fine, but I can''t

    open the tab when I manually run the command. I applied the IExtension application
    and Initialize() function, imported ads_queueexpr, and have this line in Initialize
    function: ads_queueexpr("(command \"Ribbon\")") before I run the function to create
    the tab. But it seems Ribbon can''t be edited before autocad starts fully. Is
    there a solution to this? Thnaks.'

    In AutoCAD 2010 I know you can use the CUIX API to have your custom ribbon tab

    \ = \"Register me!\";\nribButton1.CommandParameter = \"REGISTERME \";\nribButton1.ShowText\
    \ = true;\nribButton1.CommandHandler = new AdskCommandHandler();\n</pre>\n\nThe\
    \ command handler class, derived from ICommand, then takes care of executing the\
    \ command using SendStringToExecute:\n\n<pre style=\"font-size: 10pt, white-space:\
    \ -pre-wrap\">\npublic class AdskCommandHandler: System.Windows.Input.ICommand\
    \ \n{\n  public bool CanExecute(object parameter)\n  {\n    return true;\n  }\n\
    \  public event EventHandler CanExecuteChanged;\n  public void Execute(object\
    \ parameter)\n  {\n    //is from a Ribbon Button?\n    RibbonButton ribBtn = parameter\
    \ as RibbonButton;\n    if (ribBtn != null)\n      Application.DocumentManager.MdiActiveDocument.SendStringToExecute(\n\
    \        (String)ribBtn.CommandParameter, true, false, true\n      );\n    //is\
    \ from s Ribbon Textbox?\n    RibbonTextBox ribTxt = parameter as RibbonTextBox;\n\
    \    if (ribTxt != null)\n        System.Windows.Forms.MessageBox.Show(ribTxt.TextValue);\n\
    \  }\n}</pre>I hope this is enough to get you going,\n\nKean"

    In terms of simplicity and maintainability (across versions) I prefer CUI. The

    In fact, we really recommend you simply use a partial CUIx file with your ribbon
    tabs/panels pre-configured:

    If you need to load it manually (rather than via the Autoloader) then you might
    find this post helpful:

    Is there a reason you''re not able to use this approach? If not then I''ll put
    something simple together.

  body: 'I didn''t actually write this article, but I believe the idea is that there''s
    a XAML file containing references to the bitmap images you want to include. Not
    sure exactly how you do that, off the top of my head, but it should be something
    you can Google easily enough.


    Overall (and I''m sorry if I''m repeating myself) I''d still recommend creating
    a CUIX with a resource-only DLL (which is something different than a XAML resource
    dictionary). Resource-only DLLs should be placed in the same folder as the CUIX
    file - and have the same root filename, just with a .DLL extension - for AutoCAD
    to find them.

    If you want it to be persistent, you should use the CUI API to generate it in
    the CUIX file:


    <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2007/05/creating_a_part.html">http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2007/05/creating_a_part.html</a>


    Or you could load an existing, partial CUIX:


    <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2006/11/loading_a_parti.html">http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2006/11/loading_a_parti.html</a>


    Or you could run the above code whenever your application loads, of course.


    Regards,

    You shouldn''t do that. The best thing is to create a partial CUIX file and add
    it to an Autoloader bundle which will load on startup.
