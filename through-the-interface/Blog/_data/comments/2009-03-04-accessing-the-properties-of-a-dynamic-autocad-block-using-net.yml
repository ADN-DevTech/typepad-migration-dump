    From what I can tell each linear parameter (of type "Distance" in the output)
    has its own read-only Origin property. So you can identify it based on relative
    position in the list (or the fact it''s read-only). There may be other situations
    where you might get repeated property names in the list, but this is the main
    time I''ve experienced it thus far (although I admittedly haven''t worked very
    much with dynamic blocks, myself).


    Kelie -


    Unfortunately there is currently no API exposed for manipulating dynamic block
    <em>definitions</em> - only dynamic block <em>references</em>.

    I''m sure you can use WF in AutoCAD, I''ve just never tried. A more urgent topic
    for me is to spend some serious time on WPF (as we''re using it directly in AutoCAD
    for our Ribbon implementation), but I''ll add WF to my list of things to look

    I''m really new at AutoCAD this Framework (3 days old) and i have a question that

    How can i get the BlockReference from an Entity?


    Because i''m developing a Batch Process that between many things, needs some specific
    properties that i can only find in the BlockReference class, such as "Rotation".

    Have you debugged through and checked what type prop.Value is? The above code
    uses quotation marks to delimit the value - it doesn''t necessarily mean the value

    Then reads the following columns searching for parameter names and values, and

    My dynamic blocks definitions contain parametric relationships and restrictions.


    My problem comes when I run the code. If the number of parameters to modify or
    update on each block is small the code runs ok, but when I try to update around
    20 parameters, autocad crashes, like it needed more memory or resources.

    Could you give me any tips on how to use transactions so my blocks get added to
    the drawing and the updated without consuming too many resources...

    Because the Dynamic block has an Angular action and the block was rotated by this

    Only after using the rotate command the Rotation property is changed.

    So, to get the active rotation you have to get the Rotation property and the Angular
