  body: "Hallo Kean,\n\nthanks a lot for very informative blog!\nMay I bother you\
    \ with a question, concerning properties palette?\n\nI'm a little bit confused\
    \ with the use of static properties.\n\nMy intention is the following: \nI want\
    \ to create a class, derived from some Autocad entity (say, MyLine, derived from\
    \ AcDbLine).\nI add some additional members there (with ability to set and get\
    \ them). Now, I want to see corresponding additional fields in properties palette.\
    \ \nWhat should I do? I though, that static properties should be used here.\n\
    So, I have to write a COM wrapper for MyLine and reimplement MyLine::GetClassID\
    \ function, so that MyLine would \"use\" this wrapper.\nI want this wrapper to\
    \ show all the fields of AcDbLine plus some additional fields of MyLine. But how\
    \ can I make wrapper to \"inherit\" form AcDbLine wrapper, i.e. so that all IAcadLine\
    \ interface funtions were implemented? \nIn axtempl.h there is only implementation\
    \ of AcDbEntity wrapper (IAcadEntityDispatchImpl), so, if I inherit from this\
    \ template class, I have to imlement all additional AcDbLine properties by myself.\n\
    \nSo, am I right that to add new properties to line I have only two choices: either\
    \ to implement by myself all wrapper functions for AcDbLine properties, (except\
    \ those that are common for all entities) or to use dynamic properties instead?\n\
    \nThanks in Advance"

  body: "Hi Ivan,\n\nWhen you create a COM interface for your custom object, you are\
    \ doing 2 things. The first one is to enable COM programming for your object,\
    \ so VBA or another COM aware language can instantiate and use your objects. The\
    \ second is to expose your object to OPM and this is from where the difference\
    \ between static and dynamic properties comes in.\n\nStatic properties are the\
    \ COM interface properties for your object, where dynamic properties are properties\
    \ you add to your object for OPM and OPM only. OPM will use the AutoCAD dynamic\
    \ properties protocol (property manager) to retrieve them and display them.\n\n\
    Now when you want to implement properties for your object to be displayed in OPM,\
    \ you have 2 choices: static or dynamic. If you don't mind not giving access to\
    \ COM to program your objects, then dynamic properties is an option. If accessing\
    \ your object via COM is required, then you have no choice and you should implement\
    \ a COM interface.\n\nBecause you derive your object COM interface from IAcadEntityDispatchImpl,\
    \ you are losing all the properties of your parent class. If you derive from AcDbLine,\
    \ you would expect to derive the COM interface for your derived line class from\
    \ something like IAcadLineDispatchImpl. Unfortunately, this template class does\
    \ not exist in the ARX SDK, and you cannot derive from the IAcadLine interface\
    \ directly because the interface is not aggregatable.\n\nThe solution is to implement\
    \ these IAcadXXXDispatchImpl template class yourself to map the properties appropriately.\
    \ Here is below the Line sample for your convenience, and I will post all the\
    \ others to Kean to be posted on the blog separately. What is important here is\
    \ to let AutoCAD continue to do his work on categorizing properties like for native\
    \ AutoCAD entities. This is why the IAcadEntityBaseDispatchImpl template class\
    \ is implementing a lot of interface by default.\n\nPlease let me know where I\
    \ should send the sample if you interested to see the code and try on your side.\n\

    You can certainly do this for the enhanced tooltips for ribbon items, but for
    entities it''s a little harder.


    That said, if you can get the Property Palette to host the image (perhaps using
    a technique similar to that shown in <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2009/07/adding-a-dynamic-distance-property-to-an-autocad-object-using-net.html">today''s

    I like what I see here, however, I am completely foreign to C++ and COM.  How
    would I go about adding a Dynamic Blocks Unicode ''Anonymous Name'' within the
    code contained within the ''simpledynprops2.zip''?  I found that I can use the
    LIST command to provide me with the ''Anonymous Name'' however it''s easier to
    utilize the Rollover Tooltip menu.

    To give you background of the process I am trying to rid myself of, here is a
    link to my post on CadTutor (<a href="http://www.cadtutor.net/forum/showthread.php?80087-Battman-Sync...&p=542108#post542108)">http://www.cadtutor.net/forum/showthread.php?80087-Battman-Sync...&p=542108#post542108)</a>'

    I assume OPMNetExt would work for this:
