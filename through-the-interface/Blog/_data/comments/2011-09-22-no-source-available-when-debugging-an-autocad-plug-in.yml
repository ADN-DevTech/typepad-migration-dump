  body: 'Hi,

    The problem with FIBERWORLD=0 is that you end up with a "limited" version of AutoCAD,
    so the testing in the AutoCAD side (create some geometry, attributes, etc) while
    debuging is limited to very simple actions, and you can expect "unexpected" results.
    Also, you can''t test at all a ribbon customization, just for say some of the
    problems with this "workaround". I think this problem deserve a patch or service
    pack.'

  body: 'There are definitely issues (as mentioned briefly in this post) with our
    fiberless implementation: we really need people to test in this mode, however,
    and submit issues through to us to address (ideally via ADN).


    This is not a trivial undertaking, it''s an architectural change. We''re doing
    our best to get to the point where FIBERWORLD==0 is the default (i.e. only) mode
    of operation, but it''ll unfortunately take time.

    I''m not in ADN, but if you want, i can submit you all the issues i had found
    so far, may be opening a thread in .net forum so every one can post their findings.
    I understand that it''s an architectural change, and honestly i''m hopeless about
    the availability of a patch in this release.'

    We could not debug form events on a modal dialog nor an entity jig but this resolved
    the problem. Had really painful moments when porting an application into Autocad
    2012. Luckily our client was very understanding and suggested the high number
    of sunspots and the full moon as the reason for the delay due to the debugging
    problem.


    We can live with setting the fiberworld back and forth, but I certainly hope this
    will be resolved or improved somehow in the future.'

    away in Vanilla 2012 x64 forever.  Just today I started having this problem all
    of a sudden.  I suspect that installing 2013 x64 last night is to blame for the
    sudden change.  Next time you're in Edmonton, drinks are on me :)

  body: 'Kean,

    Not to unnecessarily rehash and old post, but I started running into this when
    trying to debug programs during our migration to ACAD 2014. I was initially debugging
    fine and, all of a sudden, I started receiving this error (no configuration changes
    to the solution). Anyways, when I change the fiberworld variable, AutoCAD freezes
    simply when opening some drawings. Have you run into this issue or do you have
    any insight as to what may be causing this? Thanks as always for all of the information.'

  body: 'Hi Michael,


    With fibers off (FIBERWORLD == 0) the OPEN command can often hose user input (I
    think it may have something to do with WPF and/or the ribbon). So if debugging
    a particular drawing with fibers off, I launch AutoCAD with the drawing as a command-line
    parameter (to the executable... typically from the debugger). That''s what has
    worked for me, at least.


    I hope this helps,

  body: Thanks Kean. Another behavior I noticed. I only seem to run into this error
    when I set a breakpoint in subroutines called by the form load. Once the form
    is loaded and I hit a breakpoint (for example in an event for a control), the
    breakpoint hits without issue. Not sure if this has something to do with the fact
    that the winform is now loaded and the primary application so the presence of
    fibers is a non-issue or what but just something I thought I would add.

  body: 'Hi Michael,


    I can reproduce the behaviour you describe. If I call a subroutine from a form
    I loaded with ShowModalDialog(frmName) I get the "no source available" error.
    If I call the same subroutine after returning from showing the dialog box, I can
    debug the code without problems.


    The solution of changing the value of the fibreworld variable also doesn''t worked
    for me. After I had changed the fibreworld variable, autocad hanged on startup
    and I have to change back the value in registry.
