  body: 'Hi Fernando,


    Absolutely - the size & level of detail of these models will cause performance
    issues.


    It''s certainly feasible to make more use of blocks for this: we could have a
    block containing a single cylinder of unit length & width (with colour set ByBlock)
    which could then be inserted at the appropriate colour/position/rotation & (most
    importantly) a non-uniform scale.


    It would definitely help in this tree example - as the width changed for each
    branch/twig/leaf, which means a lot of separate cylinders - but the advantages
    would be fewer where we have more complex extrusion paths (such as the Hilbert
    cube example in Part 5).


    One option would be to use blocks only for the case of 2-vertex extrusion paths,
    and leave longer paths to use the existing approach.


    Very good suggestion, though, thank you!

  body: 'Kean,


    Another approach would be a custom entity where your tree parameters like branch,
    leaf size, etc; would be the entity''s properties.


    Using the same logic you did for creating the tree entities we can draw the full
    tree using AcGi drawing primitives inside custom entity''s worldDraw().


    I''m sure this will be faster to draw than the previous "block solution". Further
    we could create a "light drawing" version of this tree which will represent it
    only by simple color line segments avoiding performance issues during drawing
    editing.


    Sound better?

  body: 'Hi Fernando,


    I actually feels it goes without saying that this could be implemented as a custom
    entity: my aim was not to implement custom objects, but to capture and create
    turtle graphics as standard entities. Perhaps that isn''t clear from the series
    itself, but it was certainly one of the design tenets I was following.


    Yes, it would be more performant, but that for me wasn''t the ultimate goal: I''m
    more interested in seeing how enabling a turtle graphics implementation might
    be within AutoCAD (especially when modelling organic/fractal forms) and ultimately
    considering what optimizations might be made to the engine on the back-end (which
    is why I like the block approach - it doesnn''t change the client code at all).
    I''m not really interested in writing a tree design application. :-)

  body: "Hi Kean,\n   I was looking at something one of the guys here in the office\
    \ was working on today and it struck me that the TurtleGfx code would be just\
    \ the ticket - the problem being I'm not sure how to implement it:\n\nBasically,\
    \ the Turtle would need to follow the path of a polyline that has a block at each\
    \ end. Normally this polyline would have only a start and an end point (thus making\
    \ it straight).  Along the length of the polyline the turtle should carry out\
    \ instructions based on information contained in a csv file. Primarily these instructions\
    \ involve placing specific blocks at measured locations and associated text notes\
    \ (along the length of the line)\n\nDo you think this might work? (or is it akin\
    \ to using a sledgehammer to break an egg?) \nWhere would I even begin to look\
    \ for code that would allow the TurtleEngine to travel along a given polyline\
    \ path? (Have I already missed it in one of your previous posts?)\n\nThanks in\
    \ advance,\n\nAlex."

  body: 'Hi Alex,


    No, I didn''t show that... in your case, though, I do think TurtleGraphics is
    overkill: you''d have to extend the engine so much to do what you need that you
    might as well create something more specific.


    I''d suggest just using Curve.GetPointAtParameter() or Curve[2/3]d.GetSamplePoints()
    to get points along the segments of your Polylines, and then add what you need
    to at those locations. The info could, of course, come from a CSV file.
