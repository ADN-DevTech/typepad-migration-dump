  body: 'So I see you doing a lot of programming with the Kinect (which is way cool
    by the way), but the question is; what is the real world application? Are we doing
    the as an intellectual exercise (which I''m good with), or am I missing a practical
    application? It would appear that the input is not accurate enough to draw in
    a real environment. What do you see as a "practical" implementation? It would
    seem that UI integration is a logical path, or am I missing something. Just wondering
    what your thought process is with this.


    Thanks'

  body: 'I don''t expect many professional designers or engineers to be using the
    Kinect as their primary input mechanism for 40 hours a week.


    But I do expect to see this kind of device used to drive collaborative model walkthroughs:
    for me the most practical application area is likely to be around navigation rather
    than modelling.
