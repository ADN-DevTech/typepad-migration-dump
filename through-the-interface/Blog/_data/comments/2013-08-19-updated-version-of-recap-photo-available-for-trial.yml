  body: Kean, do you see this software as kind of for fun, or something that has potential
    to replace 3d scanning? It seems like the limitations of reflections is fundamentally
    limiting to the technology.

  body: 'James,


    I expect it''s going to remain complimentary: reflections and translucency are
    pretty fundamental limits for certain types of model, clearly, but there are many
    for which the technology works very well.


    It''s likely we''re going to see more varied - and hybrid - scanning techniques
    emerge over time.


    But this isn''t really my field, so you have to take what I say with several pinches
    of salt.


    Cheers,


    Kean
