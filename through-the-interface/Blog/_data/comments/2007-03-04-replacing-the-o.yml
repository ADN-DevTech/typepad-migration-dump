    "_.UNDEFINE OPEN ".

  body: 'Hi Kean,

    Thank you for answering my question so quickly. You say that this is the simplest
    way, but describe a few downsides such as possible problems that might occur when
    executing this on AutoCAD startup and a UNDEFINE message that will be echoed to
    the command line; is there a more complex but preferred method for integrating
    this in 100% seamlessly, possibly even in C++?'

  body: 'Hi Patrick,


    One way to get rid of the command echo would be to use two modules: the "loader"
    module would use Document.SendStringToExecute() to use the UNDEFINE command, with
    the flag set to not echo the string to the command-line. It would then use the
    same function to load another module defining the new OPEN command.


    This would also resolve the timing issue solved previously by the call to SendCommand().

    So CreateObject() with the appropriate ProgID ("AutoCAD.Application.16"? I forget...)
    should do it from VB6, and the equivalent function VB.NET (which should be easy
    to find via Google).
