  body: The DBText object does not has a "Bounds" property in the objectarx.net version

    do this,any suggestion,thanks.

    You might try getting the GeometricExtents property (inside a try-catch block,
    as it may not be defined).

    Yes,I think GeometricExtents is the most strange property.Sometime you get the
    Origin point, sometime the correct value,sometime the exception, almost make mad

    Thank you Kean, for your blog.


    Is it possible using .NET to explode lines with linetypes (DASHED etc.) into separate
    lines with gaps, like WMFOUT command do?'

    (although that may involve capturing the plot output, much as we do for DWF),
    but it''s not straightforward.


    You might try the discussion groups - someone there may know a simpler way.

    Thanks for sharing all this! I use Industry Model with Oracle and the Entity in
    CollectPoints is shown as ImpEntity class. I was wondering if there is a way to
    retrieve the geometry for this class?

    Or is there a way to get the Autodesk.Map.IM.Data.Feature representing this ImpEntity?'

  body: 'Hi Rémy,


    I would think there has to be a way, assuming that the ImpEntity can be exploded
    into its components or there''s an API protocol that allows you to get some manner
    of the geometry/extents.


    Sadly I don''t know anything about how it works, though, so that''s about as much
    advice as I can provide.
