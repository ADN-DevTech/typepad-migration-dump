  body: 'Good to know, Daniel - I was just wondering about this yesterday, when I
    saw a tweet from a colleague saying his blog wasn''t accessible in China.


    I also wanted to take the chance to add a big thanks to the various guest contributers
    - mostly from my team, DevTech - who have provided some of the best material that''s
    been published via this blog.


    Thanks, all of you! :-)


    Kean'
