  body: 'Hi Chris,


    Thanks! Not sure how I managed to forget to use the direct method (it''s fun to
    use LINQ, but not always necessary ;-).


    I''ve gone ahead and modified the code in the post.


    Cheers,

    Using LINQ for the sake of using LINQ isn''t fun, it can be extremely wasteful
    and adversely impact performance, not to mention serving as a bad influence on
    those who aspire to learn good sound coding habits.


    For example, when you have an array and you want to do something differently with
    all but the first element (sound familiar? 8-)), you just start your for() loop
    at 1 instead of 0, and skip the pointless and wasteful overhead of having to send
    everything through IEnumerable, and then at the end, have to allocate memory to
    hold a copy of the original array elements sans the first element.'

    Nice to see you''re back to using your real name, Tony.

    Well, I''m certainly looking forward to your more generic solution. As I mentioned
    on another forum, Overrules were designed to solve a broad range of problems that
    previously required the approach taken in your post. Overrules are a very powerful
    abstraction, but please heed this advice: If not implemented correctly, overrules
    (especially ObjectOverrule) can severely impact the performance of just about
    anything the user does with AutoCAD.
