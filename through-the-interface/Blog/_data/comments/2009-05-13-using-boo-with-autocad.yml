    Really tricky but in fact you will end with several CLI options as people start
    to migrate or create portings for CLI. I think as more languages you have more
    confuse dummies will be when they start to coding for AutoCAD.


    I would like to see something more useful CLI such as LISP# or VisualLISP#. Imagine
    how fantastic this would be for the existing VisualLISP programmers to reuse their
    huge routines inside AutoCAD.


    Have you heard something about LISP CLI?


    Regards,

    Fernando.'

  body: 'Hi Fernando,


    As a dynamic language Lisp is best suited to the DLR and there was, in fact, an
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IronLisp">IronLisp</a> implementation (inspired
    in turn by <a href="http://www.lsharp.org/">LSharp</a>, which was CLI-based) before
    the author decided to focus his efforts on <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/IronScheme">IronScheme</a>
    instead.


    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_(programming_language)">Scheme</a>
    is a minimalist Lisp dialect that differs significantly from AutoLISP/Visual LISP.
    Porting any serious AutoLISP application to IronScheme would be a significant
    effort, and frankly that time would be better spent learning and migrating the
    code to VB.NET or C# (in my opinion). I would even go so far as saying - bearing
    in mind this is coming from someone who has never worked with Scheme - that the
    most valuable knowledge you''d bring from the world of AutoLISP to Scheme is knowledge
    of how to match up brackets. :-)  But I could well be wrong...


    AutoLISP is in no danger of disappearing anytime soon from AutoCAD (although there
    are flavours of AutoCAD that do not support access to their objects from AutoLISP),
    so my best advice is "leave your existing AutoLISP code where it is, and interface
    with .NET modules when you need to."


    The opinions I''ve expressed around language choice in this post are future-focused,
    not taking into account many other factors (not least of which are current skillset
    and the possible existence of a legacy codebase).


    As you no doubt remember, <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2008/07/choosing-the-pr.html">we''ve
    been here before</a> and will no doubt be here again as the language landscape
    shifts and evolves.

    Is it really a new way for all those posts to find a way with all that script
    languages to handling Acad. I think most of users are interested in practical
    Ideas for solving the daily aproaches in programmers work in a common way. Im
    a indoor developer, not interested in finding a way for the same problems with
    different scripts. I will hope to find supporting elements of real world questions
    without joining the Autodesk Developer networks, we dont have 1000$ to get Information
    of new things. We are all in small firms drafting drawings with supporting ourselfs
    with VBA and .NET Development. Now, VBA will find an End and .NET is now our toolkit
    to accelarte our work. Please shoe us solutions! Thank you'

  body: 'Hi Thomas,


    Thank you for expressing your opinion.


    I''m sure there are people out there who agree with you, just as I''m hopeful
    there are people out there that find this post interesting (and perhaps one day
    may even find it useful).


    I do my best to post on a variety of topics, some of which are of interest to
    a broad audience, some of which are of more interest to a smaller subset of my
    readership. And there are definitely quite substantial periods during which my
    posts are about things that interest me, personally, without being of everyday
    relevance for most.


    If you have specific topics you feel are relevant to be addressed, feel free to
    post a comment or <a href="mailto:kean.walmsley@autodesk.com">send me an email</a>.
    But I reserve the right to continue to choose the topics upon which I post and
    while I hope some of them may interest you, others will almost certainly not.


    Regards,

    The Overrule API just isn''t available for use by AutoLISP, which would make it
    complicated to make a comparison. :-)


    I''m still debating whether to spend some time looking into IronScheme, just for
    the sake of completeness.


    I''ve thought about the potential for a DSL for a product like AutoCAD... in a
    sense we have a very rudimentary DSL in our Script files, but perhaps something
    that fits between a general purpose language and a command-scripting language
    would make sense. My overally feel is that the development problems AutoCAD developers
    need to face on a day-to-day basis are varied enough that streamlining the coding
    experience via a DSL would end up just hampering people''s ability to solve more
    generic programming tasks. But that''s just my impression - I need to chew on
    this a little more.
