    IsPointOnCurveGCP on yesterday's post :)

  body: note that this is what civil's call a "station offset" calc. You do need to
    know what end of the line/arc is the start though. Back in LDT, it s api did station
    offset calcs, and C3D does too, but going throug the api was too slow, so I wrote
    my own geometric code to do the calc.  You might think about how to do a line/arc
    intersection sometime. There are ways to simplify and avoid complex math, but
    you still end up with several cases to test through.  Sometimes you get two points.
    The reward for doing all this is you have a standalone geometric engine and I
    can run my civil stuff on bare AutoCad.

    Your note made me nostalgic. I wrote an AutoLISP routine that did line/arc intersections
    and a few other things over 20 years ago. I was still using them with plain AutoCAD
    until recently, when I decided to stop competing internally with C3D. Glad to
    hear someone is still putting custom programs to good use.
