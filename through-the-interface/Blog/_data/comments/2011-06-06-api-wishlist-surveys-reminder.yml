  body: 'We don''t publish wishlist surveys for all our products. Some we have clear
    API roadmaps for, others are not significant platforms from a 3rd party perspective.


    AutoCAD MEP may end up being incorporated into the AutoCAD API wishlist survey,
    at some point (just as Revit''s includes Revit MEP), but this has not yet happened.

  body: 'Kean,

    The surveys mention the VLisp IDE.

    Is there really anyone at Autodesk capable of improving that IDE? It was added
    a long time ago, and may have been the work of a team that is not around these
    days.  Is that the case or is it that Autodesk prefers not to improve it?  It
    has not been touched in a while.

    thanks'

  body: 'James,


    It indeed hasn''t been touched in a while, as far as I know. Our Engineering team
    is capable of making changes to the feature, should they need to, but we prefer
    not to (to reduce the risk of introducing regression defects).


    This item continues to be popular, so although it isn''t a strategic focus for
    us to improve the IDE, it has remained on the list.

    tell you something, i.e. the strategic focus is wrong, and needs to be fixed.
