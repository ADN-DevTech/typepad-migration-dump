  body: 'Hi  Kean,


    I was evaluating this code and I face with some limitation.

    Before calling "BPJIG" command I have created a new WCS with those parameters:

    WCS:

    origin: {100, 200, 0}

    Xaxis: {0, -1, 0}

    Yaxis: {0, 0, 1}

    Zaxis: {-1, 0, 0}


    When I use this code, the polyline is not drawn correctly.

    Do you know how this code can be improved in order to work on any WCS.


    Thanks,


    Igor'

  body: 'Hi Igor,


    I used 3DORBIT to rotate the view to an arbitrary position/rotation and used UCS
    VIEW to set the UCS to that view.


    The BPJIG command worked perfectly in that UCS, as far as I could tell.


    Please provide more information on what''s not working.


    Thanks & regards,

    \ that I use a keyboard to run an Autocad command\n\nHere are the steps I used:\n\
    (1) Open a new blank document\n(2) (Command:) netload\n(3) load a NET assembly\n\

    \ and end point coordinates)\n(5) Create a new UCS using a three point command:\
    \ Origin (100,200,0) ; Point on X-axis (100,0,0) Point on Y-axis (100,200,300).\
    \ Those coordinates are in WCS\n\t\t(Command:) UCS\n\t\t(Command:) Specify origin\

    \ point on the XY plane or <accept>: 0,0,300\nHere we have created a new UCS and\
    \ we can use the Orbit to adjust the view.\n(6) run \"BPJIG\" command and using\
    \ a free mouse pointer pick several points (do not use OSnap). Important: UCS\

    \ - 1, _tempPoint.Convert2d(_plane));\nthe origin distance between WCS and UCS\
    \ is not taken into consideration and because that the polyline is not in proper\
    \ Plane.\n\nI hope I managed to explain you the procedure how to replicate my\
    \ example.\nI would like to here your opinion about this issue.\n\nThanks,\nIgor"

    I *think* I''ve addressed this with the above update. Please let me know, if not.

  body: "Kean,\n\nThe new updated code is working. \n\nAccording to me the ARX-library\
    \ is not working well for Polylines. When you set the \"Normal\" to the Polyline\
    \ then the \"Polyline.Ecs\" is calculated and here the UCS.Origin should be included\
    \ in \"Polyline.Ecs\". This should be the right way for this issue and there is\
    \ no need for setting the \"Elevation\".\n\nIf you have some free time than make\
    \ a talk to the ARX development team and see why when we set the \"Polyline.Normal\"\
    \ the \"UCS.Origin\" is not included in \"Polyline.Ecs\".\n\nThanks for the update,\
    \ a nice solution.\n\nIgor"

  body: well this is weird, if i take your code directly and run it, it works like
    it should, if i convert it to vb.net (manually or using a converter) then the
    first segment is skipped, basically you have to click two times to start the line.

  body: 'Hi Kean,


    thanks for the great codesample.

    Unfortunately it doesn''t work for me with active osnap.


    When I start drawing a polylinejig and reach an area of osnap (for example want
    to pick a lineend of an existing line with osnap to add this point to the polylinejig)
    then the jig line became invisible. The jig line is invisible untill I add a new
    vertex without osnap.


    Can you reproduce this error?


    Regards,

    Frank'

    It works well for me when osnapping to existing geometry, as you''ve described.
    I test on AutoCAD 2013 x64.


    Perhaps there''s a specific case that I''m missing to reproduce the problem?

    I am sorry for my comment above. I found the error in my code. There was a sub
    transaction in my PointMonitor event which was not commited in some cases.
