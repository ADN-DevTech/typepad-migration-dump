  body: Seems that property palette support has been on the list for many years! Let
    our voices rise, perhaps we can get that support this year! :)

  body: 'Almost ALL the items on the Lists have been due for attention for a while
    ... as well as several that are not included.


    There''s a distinction between hearing and doing something about what [you''re]
    hearing.


    not personal Kean, just an observation.

  body: 'Hi Kerry,


    I appreciate your feedback, but in fairness our Engineering teams take these surveys
    extremely seriously.


    Given the nature of when the surveys occur during our software development cycle
    (and other drivers behind development priorities), we can''t realistically deliver
    everything on each survey - and yes, items do stay on the list for multiple years
    for various reasons - but that doesn''t diminish the importance put into the data
    we acquire via these surveys.


    I really want to encourage people to use these surveys: the more people who weigh
    in, the more impetus our Product Management teams have to assign valuable resources
    to help address longstanding issues.


    Regards,


    Kean
