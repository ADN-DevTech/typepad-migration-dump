    A portion of my post is true, by the way (I''ll leave it for readers to guess
    which part ;-).

  body: 'One question...

    Why? Why on earth would you want to run games through AutoCAD??? Yes, it has Heidi
    in the background, but AutoCAD 3d objects can perform terribly, and you have to
    purchase autocad to play the game in the first place!


    Of course, these ideas are great, but not very practical.


    What is Autodesk playing at eh? They gonna try buy out the XBOX? Or maybe even
    take over MS? Imagine that! :p

  body: Some people probably think that's just a bad photo of Christer, but he really
    does turn bright red when he's programming. Airbrushing out the horns was probably
    a sensible move :-).

    I knew you were out-to-lunch. Can't trust any blogs on April 1st.

    Incidentally, Christer''s games are also fully functional (and may even get released
    via the Exchange Store, at some point). That''s the half of the post that was
    true. :-)
