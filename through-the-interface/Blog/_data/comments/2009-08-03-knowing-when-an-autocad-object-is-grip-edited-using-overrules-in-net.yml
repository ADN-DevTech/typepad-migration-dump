    I am wanting to add some extra custom grips to a civil3d object a key design locations
    to move them by this point Do you know if this is possible. If it is could you
    do a post in the future on it with an example.

    Try searching on GripOverrule, and be sure to check out the "New APIs in AutoCAD
    2012" DevTV and samples.


    That should point you in the right direction, to start with, at least.

    I tried to use your example to Overrule a grip_stretch on a block reference, but
    it''s not working: the block reference is not moved. It''s working however on
    a Line, on the same drawing. What i''m doing wrong?

    Thanks'

    I just used your code. No other code. Then I netloaded it and drew 2 circles to
    create a new block (using autocad gui). The overrule is not working on the block!
    However if I draw a line and use your code on it then it''s working...

    Thanks for your time.'

    I see the same thing, but it doesn''t appear to be anything specific to my overrule
    implementation: if you overrule grips for blocks - even with an implementation
    of your methods that just supermessages to the base class - the existing grip
    move operation appears to stop working (although you could basically implement
    it yourself, if you needed to overrule grip move for blocks and have additional
    behaviour to want to implement).


    It''s not clear to me whether this is "as designed" or not: if you''re an ADN
    member you should submit it there, or you might otherwise post to the AutoCAD
    .NET Discussion Group.
