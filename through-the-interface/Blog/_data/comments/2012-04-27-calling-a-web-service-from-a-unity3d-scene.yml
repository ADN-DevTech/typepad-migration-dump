    I suspect the performance impact of using switch rather than an array lookup isn''t
    significant (as it''s a load-time operation, even if it''s being called a thousand
    or so times), but it''s a good point - it is likely to be more efficient to use
    an array.


    I won''t bother changing the code this post, but I will use that approach for
    the Android project I''ll show next time.

  body: thx, very neat! do you think i could use a similar approach to suck some Revit
    model geometry to a web service that i implement and then access that to display
    it as a scene in a unity engine?

  body: 'I would think so, although if you want visual fidelity it might be a challenge.
    You might look at the export formats from Revit vs. the import formats in Unity
    - there may even be some overlap (if you''re lucky).

    Library files from Revit.

    What would it take to make the Apollonian Sphere interactive like the chairs and
    table?  (I must confess, while playing around with your scene, I couldn''t resist
    going all Bobby Knight on one of the chairs! ;)'

  body: 'Hehe - I had to Google Bobby Knight (I''m dreadful with sports references,
    in general), but I''m glad you had some fun. I did, too, when I realised you could
    throw stuff around. :-)


    I think it must have something to do with the DrawRigidbodyShadow.js script...
    I also had the same thought (it would be really cool to be able to interact with
    these objects), but didn''t get beyond that.


    Let me know if you manage to get something working!

  body: I found this very helpful. I am looking to consume a wcf service from a unity
    scene. Do you know if this works on iOS/Android? I'd prefer to find out now before
    I get the liscense!

  body: 'As I''m sure you''re aware, WCF is very easily exposed via REST, so this
    technique *should* help. I''d expect the code to consume a service to work just
    as well on iOS/Android, but I haven''t specifcally tested it (I didn''t see the
    need to invest in a license, myself).


    Good luck!
