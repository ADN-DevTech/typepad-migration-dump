  body: 'cool stuff. So its points and then faces. Is the final product a solid? Are
    the points just face corners, or are you making them define splined framework
    for a subd solid? One thing civils have asked for is a fast tin surface to solid
    routine. We have one that unions one prism of each triangle at a time to some
    main solid, but its too slow for hundreds of thousands of triangles.

    Are we missing some pattern that could be used to make this faster?

    thx'
