  body: 'Hi Rhys,


    I haven''t suffered from memory issues with this tool, myself, and I''m running
    on 32-bit Vista with the 3Gb flag set (I have 4Gb of physical RAM). Neither has
    anyone reported anything similar.


    Have you experienced memory issues on this paticular system before? Do you have
    access to any other systems you might try it on?


    Regards,


    Kean'

  body: 'Hi Kean,


    This looks very good; Shame I can only attend the Virtual classes.


    On a related note, some clever people are already using the Microsoft Kinect for
    3D Imaging:

    Yes, that is a shame. I''ll be at the Farnborough DevDay in December, in case
    you''re able to make it to that. And I won''t be presenting, so should have plenty
    of time to chew the fat. :-)


    I''ve been following some of the developments around depth cameras, especially
    related to Kinect. I hadn''t seen this one. Too cool!


    Thanks,
