  body: You mentioned that Lightswitch is not able to do many-to-many relationships,
    but if you search for this topic it looks like there is a workaround for this
    scenario.  It looks like you need to add this relationship after the wizard has
    finished.  Did you look into this and try it for your application?  I noticed
    in part 1 that you mentioned Lightswitch is not suitable for what you want to
    use it for since there is this limitation.

  body: 'The workaround seems to be to create a mapping table between fields. This
    may be an option for your own database structure, but I couldn''t find a way to
    make that work with existing SharePoint data.


    If you''ve found otherwise, please post a link - I''d love to give it a try.


    In the end I was still able to create a usable app, but it just doesn''t help
    with goal creation (more with querying and updating status information, later
    on).
