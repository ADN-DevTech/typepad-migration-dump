  body: 'Thanks for the information. Some times we are using Editor interactions from
    a PaletteSet control. But it''s unable to focus Editor ( drawing window ) via
    .NET API. Is there any way to control this behavior.

    Thanks again.'

  body: 'It''s hard to tell exactly what you mean by "focus" (it might be understood
    in the Windows sense of taking the active application focus, or something related
    to zooming inside the AutoCAD editor).


    I''d suggest submitting your question to my team through the ADN website, or posting
    it to the .NET Discussion Group.'

  body: 'Hi Erhan,


    I wouldn''t be using the Editor methods from a palette (or any other modeless
    UI) if I were you. When the modeless UI needs to interact with the editor or database
    you should post a command (using Document.SendStringToExecute) and do the editor
    or database interaction inside the command.'

  body: "Hi Kean,\n\nThe code above could be simplified by using Editor.GetSelection().\
    \ GetSelection will do everything you want: \n1. Get the implied selection if\
    \ available and clear it.\n2. Prompt the user with \"Select objects:\" if an implied\
    \ set isn't available.\n\nYou would only want to do what is shown above if you\
    \ want to customize the prompt issued."

    it does not work in AutoCAD 2010?
