    Is it poosible to create a LineType that has,  say 16 characters (--- Blah Blah

    Regardless the radius of the circle.'

  body: 'I just copied the standard acad.lin file and edited it, adding my own custom
    linetype to the end. I added a couple of Unicode arrows("»→"), to test it out,
    replacing the HW in the standard HOT WATER sample linetype:


    *ARROW_TEST,Arrows showing flow ---- »→ ---- »→ ---- »→ ----

    A,.5,-.2,["»→",STANDARD,S=.1,R=0.0,X=-0.1,Y=-.05],-.2


    I had to changed the file encoding to Unicode for it to save properly, but AutoCAD
    understood the file when loading it via the LINETYPE command, and it appears to
    display as I''d expect when applied to a line.


    It''s a text-based solution, but at least it''s not using < or >.

    The linetype definition worked fine for me (I only tested in AutoCAD 2009). I
    preceded your line with this one:


    *E_TEST,E on a line ---- E ---- E ---- E ----

    So maybe you just need to load the linetype?


    Take a look at the code in <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2010/03/loading-multiple-linetypes-into-autocad-using-net.html">this
