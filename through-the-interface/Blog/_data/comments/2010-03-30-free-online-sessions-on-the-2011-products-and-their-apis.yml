    Sorry - I only just got notified of your comment (we''ve been having some infrastructure
    issues, it seems), and now the session has already taken place.


    Hopefully you were able to attend, otherwise a recording will soon be posted to
    <a href="http://www.adskconsulting.com/adn/cs/api_course_webcast_archive.php">our
    webcast archive</a>.

  body: 'Quick question: I have just installed VS2010 from MS Subscription Pro along
    with .NET 4.0. I know that there has been issues in AutoCAD 2010 with .NET 4.0.


    With AutoCAD 2011, can I use the extra benefits of .NET 4.0?'

    AutoCAD 2011 does (I''m pretty sure) support .NET 4.0. You can see in its acad.exe.config
    manifest, that there''s a comment provided showing how to roll-forward .NET 2.0
    apps, in case.


    A member of my team has experienced some general issues with using the final VS
    2010 release (while he had no problems with the RC version), but I''m yet to see
    other, corroborative reports, as yet.
