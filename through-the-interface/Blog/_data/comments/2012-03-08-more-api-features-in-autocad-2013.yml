    If you''re not an ADN member, I suggest posting your request on the ObjectARX

  body: 'Hi, I found out that if I implement IExtensionApplication to a class, the
    AutoLoader mechanism will result in a Fatal Error if set LoadOnAutoCADStartup="True"
    in the PackageContents.xml.


    The application after one Fatal Error will run normally but then the next time
    there will be another Fatal Error. And so on.


    Can you say anything meaningful about this? Thanks!'
