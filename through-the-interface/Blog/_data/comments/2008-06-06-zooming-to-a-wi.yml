  body: 'Hi, it seems you guys are well versed in what ever you do.


    Could you help me in a application am trying to develop for my project work in
    school?


    I have developed this application whic calculates for coordinates of ground points
    on the surface of the earth. I want to represent these points in autocad without
    actually launching autocad.

    What i want to do is to just click a button from vb.net to plot the points and
    save it as dxf or dwg file which can later be opened with autocad 2002 or 2004.


    Or maybe, if you could also help me so that, as the coordinates are calculated
    in XYZ system, it does the representation in an autocad window on the same form.

    thanks.'

    I didn''t find a suitable post to add the comment. Even Google this time is not
    my friend! Sorry about that...


    Is there a way to know when a Transaction is effectively committed and executed
    so that changes are completed on the working database? I understand that trans.Commit()
    is an async call, am I right? Even the public property "IsCommitted" is flagged
    as soon the transaction.Commit() is issued but not effectively completed...

    Thanks

    own app, then waiting until Commit() has happened should be enough - otherwise
    you may need C++ to get transaction reactors.


    But yes, this is off-topic (and if I start answering off-topic questions here
    the blog will devolve into a support forum :-). Please try posting to the AutoCAD
    .NET discussion group or to ADN...

    You can certainly create new ViewTableRecords in the Database. As for setting

    I''ve just noticed Database.HomeView, which appears to be editable. Could you
    try setting the parameters to see what happens? I''m guessing that has something
    to do with the ViewCube, but I could be wrong.
