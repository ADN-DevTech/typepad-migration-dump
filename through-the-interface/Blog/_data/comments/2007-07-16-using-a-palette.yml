  body: "\"Firstly, why bother? Well, the PaletteSet class is realy cool: it provides\
    \ docking, auto-hide, transparency and fixes the annoying focus-related issues\
    \ we see with normal modeless dialogs\"\n\nThanks for some good basic samples\
    \ of using the PropertyGrid. In the future, you might want consider doing a bit\
    \ more testing before presenting them.\n\nA bit more thorough testing in this\
    \ particular case would have uncovered the significant problems that exist with\
    \ AutoCAD's Palettes and .NET controls like the PropertyGrid.\n\nTo see one major\
    \ problem, place a PropertyGrid on a Palette and add it to a PaletteSet. Create\
    \ the PaletteSet and show it. Dock the PaletteSet to any side of the AutoCAD window.\
    \ Then, assign an object to the PropertyGrid's SelectedObject property, which\
    \ has properties that use drop-down editing components (either drop-down combo\
    \ boxes, or dropdown controls like the standard Color editor used by .NET for\
    \ editing a color property). \n\nThen, with the PaletteSet docked, try to edit\
    \ the properties of the assigned object(s) that use the aforementioned dropdown\
    \ editors, and note what happens.\n\nI thought I'd mention this in the hope that\
    \ your readers do not get the impression that using the PropertyGrid on a Palette\
    \ is feasable, as it is not, or at least not until Autodesk figures out how to\
    \ resolve the issues that can be seen by just following the above steps.\n\nIt's\
    \ great to publish samples of how to exploit the .NET framework and its wealth\
    \ of functionality. But in cases like this (using the PropertyGrid on a Palette)\
    \ where, practicle application is severely hampered and unfeasable because of\
    \ show-stopping issues, those issues warrant mention and discussion in the context\
    \ of even the most basic samples."

    There''s no PropertyGrid in this sample, just a TextBox, so I don''t see what
    "more thorough testing" I''ve failed to perform.


    I''m not aware of specific issues around the use of a PropertyGrid with a Palette,
    but it sounds like an interesting topic to cover at some point.

  body: I'm making a palette in vb.net, but loading is very inconsistant, and i can't
    seem to get it to resize from code. sometimes it comes in all crazed and can't
    be resized, i've learned that this usually happens if i've already closed a drawing
    in that session of autocad. does anybody know a remedy for this situation? anybody
    else had this problem? it usually works just fine if i load my palette just after
    i start autocad, but i need it to be able to be loaded anytime for my other users.
    thanks for whatever help anybody can give on this, if you need me to post my code
    just let me know.

    \  What happens is, when I first show the palette, it looks fine except I can't\
    \ get it to show undocked, even though I added a line to set the Dock property\
    \ to none.\n\nThen, while the palette is shown I am prompting the user for a selection,\
    \ and if you manipulate the palette, the contents disappear, and my selection\
    \ prompt gets canceled.\n\nIf you let the thing show where it wants, and don't\
    \ touch it, everything works fine, including when I update the text (my user control\
    \ has 5 fixed labels, and 5 label controls I update with values).  But if you\
    \ touch the palette to move it, undock it, etc... it misbehaves badly.\n\nFor\
