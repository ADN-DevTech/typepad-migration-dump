  body: I like it the way it is, as it's easy to search through the page if you're
    looking for a specific term (especially with Firefox, just start typing and you're
    there ;-) )

    I suppose all posts, in XPS format (or DWFX :-) if you prefer) added to a zip
    archive for download is too much to ask? ;-) Maybe quarterly or yearly? Sort of
    like ''Through-the-interface''s greatest hits''...


    Cheers,

    Glenn.'

    A book would absorb too much time... my blog output would dwindle to nearly nothing
    for 1-2 years, I expect. Which just seems like a poor trade-off, in my mind. And
    code is so much easier to copy & paste from a blog. :-)


    Keep trying, though, Fernando - maybe I''ll give in, one day. :-)


    Glenn -


    I''ve been looking at options for offline viewing, especially as it seems all
    TypePad blogs are blocked by the Great Firewall of China. :-(


    If anyone knows of a tool that can compile/archive TypePad blog content, please
    let me know!

    Very good page,thanks for the great work.

    you are right, I am the sufferer of the Great Firewall of China,thanks for the
    tor and Firefox,but I still to suffer the looooooowly speed.

    I am the lucky beggar,but not anyone knows tor and how to make it work with Firefox,so
    they will saw the searching results in Google but can not open it.'
