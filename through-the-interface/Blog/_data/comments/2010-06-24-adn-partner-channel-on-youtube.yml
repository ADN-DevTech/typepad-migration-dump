  body: 'Hi Yoann,


    I see what''s happened... a tool I''ve integrated into the blog has hijacked the
    PDF link to show it in a pop-up. But as the file is behind a login, the tool can''t
    access it.


    I''ll see if I can fix it... thanks for reporting the problem.

    Thank you for another good example!!!


    It would be nice to we can add hatch without

    persistent objects into database.

    I am not sure is posible to draw hatch with

    worlddraw (if we want to override drawing for example

    some line with hatch)...


    Best regards,

    Danijel'
