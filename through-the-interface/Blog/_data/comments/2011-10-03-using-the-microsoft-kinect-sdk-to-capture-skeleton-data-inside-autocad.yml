  body: 'The "Kinect" category of this blog is a good place to start. I don''t really
    have good suggestions beyond that, as I haven''t really used specific resources
    when developing this code (just Google and whatever hits it served up).

  body: 'That makes sense... you might want to try the "My first AutoCAD plugin" guide
    (which you can get to from the AutoCAD Developer Center: <a href="http://autodesk.com/developautocad).">http://autodesk.com/developautocad).</a>


    You can also download and install a 30-day trial of AutoCAD, too.
