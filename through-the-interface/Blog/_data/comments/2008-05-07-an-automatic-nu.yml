    Anyways, great work and good job for having the perseverance to do all this by
    yourself. That huy who e-mailed you sure got a lot of "tuts in the right direction"
    from you.

    You''ll need to use Visual Studio to build the source code into a .NET assembly
    (a .DLL) that can be loaded by the NETLOAD command.

  body: "Kean,\nI have a tab seperated text file which is used as a base file of all\
    \ the attribute values used in a project. The first column is the primary key.\
    \ Using VBA, I could update all the attributes in a drawing by reading the lines\
    \ from the text file, provided that first attribute value of the block is same\
    \ as the primary key.\nIn .NET\n1. I could read each line of text file as an array,\n\
    2. I could iterate through the blocks satisfying my naming conventions,\n\nBUT,\
    \ \nI could NOT compare the string array with the array of block attributes.\n\
    \nAny help or drive towards the actual direction is highly appreciated in advance.\n\
