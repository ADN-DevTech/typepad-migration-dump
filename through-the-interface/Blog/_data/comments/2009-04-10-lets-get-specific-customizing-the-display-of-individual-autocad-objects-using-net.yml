    I''m a bit puzzled as to why you would add the Overrule to the Drawable type,
    because that means it will be called for every object whose class derives from
    that type (e.g., all entities).


    Why not add the overrule to the Circle and Line classes only?'

    just a long weekend here in Europe and I''m tying not to spend time online. :-)


    The original sample was written this way to show how to call through to the base
    implementation when dealing with an object we don''t care about, but it''s definitely
    going to make sense to attach our overrule at more specific scopes in the next
    post (where we''re going to use XData filtering provided by the Overrule framework
    to further optimize the process).
