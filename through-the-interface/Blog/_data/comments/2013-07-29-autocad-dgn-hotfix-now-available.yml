    But you could build <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2013/07/minor-update-to-the-dgn-purge-command.html">the
    code for the clean-up tool</a> into a DLL project (which doesn''t reference AcCoreMgd.dll)
    that will work in prior releases of AutoCAD.

  body: How long is the tool supposed to take? I have a file that is 47Mb and when
    I run the command, AutoCAD just sits there and never seems to do anything. It
    doesn't crash, I don't get an error message or anything, it just freezes. I've
    waited over 10minutes before I give up and force close AutoCAD. Any thoughts?

    it into memory). The code runs through pretty much everything in a drawing to
    determine what can be removed.


    That said, it''s also possible there''s corruption in the drawing that causes
    a problem with the code. Have you tried running AUDIT or RECOVER on the DWG in
    question?

    I may not be able to mail the DWG file due to Companies confidentiality policy.

    Also i checked with the latest version of the tool posted on the web, which again

    Thanks

    A lot depends on what data you have in your DWG (paperspace layouts, etc.). Your
    approach is less targeted, but I''m happy it works well for you (and no doubt
    will for some others, too).
