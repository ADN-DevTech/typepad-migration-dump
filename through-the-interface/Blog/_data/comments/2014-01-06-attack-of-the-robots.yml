  body: 'ahh, being led down the path of path generation are we? Sooner or later,
    this will lead to gcode generation from 3d solids, you know it. That fact that
    acad does not make gcode and stl for 3d printing is a glaring gap given Autodesk''s
    adoption of the maker trend. Not only that, I had to pull in a recent solid model
    to Bricscad to convert it to decent triangles for the stl conversioin through
    shetchup. Bcad has a different command to explode solids that gave better tesselation
    than acad.

    How about we make our own g-code language, since we know how steppers are controlled
    and have modern programming objects.'

  body: 'I have no doubt that 2014 is the year I''ll start 3D printing in earnest.
    I''m still a long way off developing my own control language for it, though.


    But first things first... this post is proposing very basic (low precision) path
    generation.
