  body: The MDI was big advance in AutoCAD development. However a lot of LISP that
    was created as intelligent batch program were basically cripple. When a LISP file
    opens a drawing that is as far as it goes unless to teach it to write and run
    a script in which an external text file has been created and managed.

  body: 'Yes, LISP isn''t the best way to batch up operations in an MDI environment:
    the decision was made during development of AutoCAD 2000 to have each document
    maintain its own namespace. This was by far the best way to maintain compatibility
    with existing LISP code, but made it hard to work across documents.


    Suddenly COM (VB) became the interface (language) of choice for this (or a tool
    such ScriptPro, in combination with a LISP-defined command).'
