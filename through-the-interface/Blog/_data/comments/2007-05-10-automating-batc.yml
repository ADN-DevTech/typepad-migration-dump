  body: 'Thank you for your example. It was very helpful for me.

    I have a question. I created a new plotter using "Autodesk ePlot (PDF)". When
    I use AutoCAD''s Plot command, it takes couple of seconds to produce the PDF file.
    However, when I try to generate the plot through the code, after pe.EndPlot(null),
    it takes between 30 Sec to a minute till PDF gets created. I have to actually
    test the ProcessPlotState during this time as I don’t want to return the control
    while PDF is not ready.

    Any idea why it takes so much longer to produce the PDF this way?'

  body: 'Hi Artem,


    It could be that background plotting is switched on. If the BACKGROUNDPLOT sysvar
    is set to 1 or 3, then PLOT will background plot. This doesn''t explain why the
    command takes less time than your code, but it''s a direction in which to start
    your investigations.

    That was it! Setting BACKGROUNDPLOT sysvar to zero resolved the issue.

    I''m a VB.NET programmer and need to write a Windows Service that prints DWF files.
    Can I use the Design Review API to print DWF files using VB.NET? Any basic code
    examples would be very helpful as well.


    Thanks in advance!'

  body: I'm currently working with the batch printing and it's working properly. I'm
    dynamically creating the BPJ file in C# and then running the batch.  The problem
    I'm having is trying to set the Page Range for printing.  No matter what I put
    in this variable, it will print all the pages of a DWF.  I'd like to only print
    the first page in the DWF.  In fact when I'm using the Batch Print Wizard in Design
    Review it grays out all of the options to choose a page range in the Print Settings,
    "All" is the only option you can select.  Do you know why this is?

    Yes, this post - unlike the vast majority of the others on this blog - is about
    using a product/tool''s UI to customize it.


    And yes, the comment preview is messy, but it''s TypePad''s. I don''t have any
