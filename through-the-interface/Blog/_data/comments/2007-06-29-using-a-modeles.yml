  body: 'Thank you for the code sample, and I have a question?


    If you have for example, a polyline in the for of a slot when two of the sides
    have an arc, and you have other polylines that meet those sides and all around
    that slot to leave it as an island.


    Pointmonitor do not work and I have seen other cases where fail to select.


    Is there something we can do?


    I have tried to use this class before in one of my commands to select closed areas
    but not always was giving me the right one.


    Then, I end up making a selection of the closed polylines on the screen and using
    a function to select the polyline by defining an internal point, instead.


    Thanks!

  body: 'I have been using PointMonitor to display information about the entity via
    AppendToolTipText.  It works great except for one thing:  My drawing is mostly
    solids and if I hover over a solid so that it is highlighted, it will actually
    display the information of the solid that is behind the object that I''m trying
    to get the information for.


    How can I assure that I get the information for the object that is being highlighted?'

    I''m afraid your description of the geometry isn''t clear to me. Are you trying
    to detect when the cursor is hovering within a particular object? Unfortunately
    "pick in space" is not enabled when hovering over objects - the PointMonitor doesn''t
    pick them up. Unless I''ve misunderstood...


    Tom -


    I''m not sure why this is happening. One thought is to make sure you''re not picking
    the wrong item from the list (assuming there are more than one entity returned
    by the PointMonitor). I tried to reproduce the problem in my own code, but it
    seemed to work OK - a lot may depend on which visual style you''re working with,
    etc.

    Excuse my bad explanation :(


    Let see if I can explain better this time, by providing a short sample that can
    give you an idea:


    Draw an ellipse (with pellipse=1), then draw a rectangle to enclosure that ellipse
    in the center.


    Then, draw a line that divides the rectangle, can be drawn vertical or horizontal.
    Then use the command bpoly and generate two new closed polylines in the areas
    between the rectangle and the ellipse on the center.


    Erase, the original rectangle, and the line, and now call or use the pointmonitor,
    it won''t select the ellipse, I know it can be brought up with draworder and later
    use the pointmonitor.


    The sample I provided it is very simple, but in the case I was thinking of using
    it it gets more complex, and the idea is have an easy selection, that''s why I
    end up using a point inside the areas.


    Hope, you are not sleep when reading this last line.


    Thanks!'

    The parent of CAdUiPaletteSet (the internal MFC/ObjectARX class the PaletteSet
    wraps) is CAdUiDockControlBar, which is not exposed through the .NET API.


    So PaletteSet is currently the way to go for implementing a dockable modeless
    UI inside AutoCAD using .NET.


    Is there a particular reason you''d prefer not to use it?

    Hi Kean,


    Would you please help me in finding a way to get/retain focus in a modeless form?


    Many Thanks,'
