  body: 'What is your main concern with the way LISP is working with UNICODE? I know
    that functions that call through to ActiveX/COM Automation don''t support the
    passing of UNICODE strings (when setting text in a drawing to a UNICODE value,
    for example).


    Please let me know what specifically the concern is, and I''ll try to get you
    a response. There are no current plans to improve the level of UNICODE support
    in LISP (even with respect to COM/ActiveX support), so if there are major issues
    it would be good to understand them and pass that feedback on to Engineering.

    of question to the discussion groups or contacting ADN support.]


    The Character Map system tool in Windows will tell you the code (at least, that''s
    the way I do it). \U+0394 will get you capital Delta and \U+03B4 will get you
    lowercase Delta.
