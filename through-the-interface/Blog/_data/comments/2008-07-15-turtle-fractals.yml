  body: 'Hi Mark,


    Wow - interesting, and more than a little scary. My apologies for bringing down
    your system. :-(


    I didn''t try moving any of the cubes I created, I have to admit. These are very
    (and I mean *very*) complex polylines, and so have pretty extreme memory and display
    requirements.


    I''m toying with ideas about breaking the polylines into separate ones for different
    pen colours and widths (extruding circular profiles whenever the pen width or
    colour changes), which will either help or make things worse... we''ll see.


    This is a good reminder, though: if playing around with stuff like this, don''t
    be working on anything significant in another window! :-)


    Regards,


    Kean
