  body: 'No, not really. It''s my belief that the author''s confusing his own feelings
    about a language with its future popularity. I could do a very similar rant about
    JavaScript or Objective-C, but I don''t see it changing anything. Language choice
    is ultimately only partially about the power and beauty of the language, and much
    more about the platform you''re targeting. And JavaScript runs *everywhere*, whether
    he likes it or not.


    Something that resonates is a comment on that post that says (and I paraphrase):
    "in the future everyone will run JavaScript but no-one will write it". (Meaning
    that people will write in languages such as CoffeeScript, TypeScript and Dart
    that compile to JavaScript, rather than writing directly in JavaScript.)


    When I read that I googled the phrase "JavaScript is the Assembly Language of
    the Web" (which is a fair analogy for the above comment), and - sure enough -
    <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/JavaScriptIsAssemblyLanguageForTheWebSematicMarkupIsDeadCleanVsMachinecodedHTML.aspx">someone
    whose opinion I respect a great deal has said something similar</a>.


    I''ll be continuing to invest at least some time in this, myself, anyway.

  body: 'Hi, Kean.


    1. I can''t find the definition of "onmouseover" callback (attribute <i>t:onmouseover</i>
    of <i>&lt;drawable&gt;</i> xml-element).


    2. Where can I find information about the xml-schemes <i>drawstream.xsd</i> and
    <i>transient.xsd</i>.

    Will there be a similar functionality (declarative way of graphics creating) is
    available from the .NET API or as an AutoCAD command?


    Excuse my bad english :('

  body: 'Hi Salt,


    Your English is very clear.


    1. That doesn''t appear to be implemented in this .js file. Which may well mean
    it''s redundant (I''d need to dig out this sample and double-check to confirm
    - you might try removing it to see whether there''s any impact on the code, such
    as the cursor type not changing...).


    2. I asked about these some time ago: as far as I can tell, they still haven''t
    been posted publicly (this is a preview API, after all). I''ll post another comment
    if I can track them down.


    I don''t know of any plans to make a declarative .NET (or command-line) API for
    transient graphics: it''s certainly something you code put together yourself,
    if you have enough of a need for one.
