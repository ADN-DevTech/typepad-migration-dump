  body: 'Nice Kean,

    Both of these items are quite helpful, however, I''d love to know more about the
    QAFLAGS variable.  I would love to be able to have it not prompt to "Press Enter
    to Continue", but I tried the variable set to 8191 as suggested, and it had an
    unexpected side effect.  I have an .MNL file that goes with my menu, so that whenever
    my menu is loaded, the .dll is netloaded through the .MNL file.  This mechanism
    stopped working when I set the QAFLAGS variable, and started working fine again
    when I removed the QAFLAGS key from the FixedProfile registry.


    Have you (or Fenton) got an answer for that?'

  body: 'Hi David,


    I should really have mentioned that QAFLAGS is a useful tool for certain circumstances,
    but should not be set to anything but 0 for long periods of time. It''s an undocumented
    sysvar which could ultimately have unpredictable effects if left set (as you''ve
    discovered).


    So feel free to use it when calling specific commands, but please don''t rely
    on it beyond that.


    BTW - there''s no need to create a Registry key for this. QAFLAGS can be set (and
    unset) at the command-line.


    Regards,


    Kean'

  body: 'Thanks for the setting, Kean, that''s really handy. I''ve been missing that
    setting ever since it was removed from the UI.


    But QAFLAGS 8191? Really? 1111111111111 hex? Why turn on 13 bits and put up with
    undocumented side effects when you could just turn on the bit that matters? QAFLAGS
    2 will turn off the scroll stopper and nothing else.


    In the R12 cycle, after the scroll stopper feature was introduced without an off
    switch and people complained about it (some lessons are apparently never learned,
    no matter how many times they are repeated), QAFLAGS 2 was made public as a workaround
    by Autodesk staff on CompuServe. After 19 years of unchanged functionality, it''s
    probably safe to assume that QAFLAGS 2 isn''t going to go away or start doing
    strange things any time soon.


    The following ancient QAFLAGS bits are public knowledge (thanks to Owen Wengerd),
    but I haven''t checked them lately:


    bit 0 (1) : ^C in menu macro cancels grips (acts like keyboard <Esc>).

    bit 1 (2) : no pause during text screen listings.

    bit 2 (4) : no "alert" dialogs (text display instead).

    bit 7 (128) : accepts "screen picks" (point lists) via (command) function.'

    given the associated risks).


    If I''d been aware it was just that second bit, I''d have stated that, of course
    (and will adjust the post to reflect that, leaving this comment in place).


    Thanks, Steve!

  body: 'Another tip on the topic of the command-line text window...


    I found a way to maximize the text window by P/Invoking Win32.dll. You can do
    this using the helper class found here: <a href="http://212.40.172.33/WebAppCodeGod/Win32-Window-Handler-in-C-AID134.aspx">Win32Handler</a>.
    Just copy-paste it straight into your code.


    And here''s an AutoCAD command to demonstrate:


    [CommandMethod("MaximizeTextScreen")]

    public static void MaximizeTextScreen() {

    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Autodesk.AutoCAD.Internal.Utils.TextScr();

    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp WindowHandler wh = new WindowHandler();

    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp int windowHandle = wh.GetForegroundWnd();

    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp wh.Maximize(windowHandle);

    }'

    If it were a version other that 2012 English, the Registry key would change, but
    whether it''s 64-bit or not doesn''t change anything.
