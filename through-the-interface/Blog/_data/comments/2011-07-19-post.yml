  body: 'For long single operations that cannot be iterated, a good tip is to change
    the cursor to a spinning wheel. Otherwise the cursor just disappears and the user
    will not know what is happening.


    I''ve been using this technique when calling the Solid3d.CreateSweptSolid() method,
    which depending on the complexity of the geometry hangs for a bit while processing.


    Refer to the following post for details:

  body: Kean, I've got a long operation that calls Database.SaveAs() multiple times
    during the opreation. It seems that this method has its own ProgresMeter and overwrites
    then turns off my ProgresMeter. Is there a way to keep this from happening?

    The P/Invoke method Kean mentioned does not have this issue.

  body: 'Hi Henk,


    Good question - for me it also updates in chunks, which is almost certainly for
    performance reasons. You might try contacting ADN (directly or via the AutoCAD
    .NET discussion group), to see if they have any suggestions.

  body: 'Hello Kean,


    if have found this earlier... :-) I''ll keep this in mind for the future.

    Since with this approach I can show a built-in Progressbar for something my AddIn
    does, is there any Progress-reporting in Builtin methods? I think of showing the
    number of items inserted using WblockCloneObjects with a Collection of Objectids...
    Or may I loop the WblockCloneObjects through my Objectids to catch the progress?

    Thanks in advance,

    Daniel'

    Inserting the Objects 1 by 1 in a loop kills the performance and the using of
    WblockCloneObjects looses it''s sense :-)

    Any hints on this were appreciated :-)

    Thanks,

  body: 'Hello Daniel,


    Unfortunately any single long-running operation can''t be (or at least isn''t)
    profiled with that granularity. Of course passing some kind of callback into the
    function would be ideal, but that''s not how things have been implemented.


    You could try breaking things up into individual - or smaller - sets to be called
    with, but that''s not always possible.


    Sorry not to be of more help,
