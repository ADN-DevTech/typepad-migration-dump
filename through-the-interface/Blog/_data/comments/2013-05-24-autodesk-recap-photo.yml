    Thanks for the mention of recap, I was just making install images and was wondering
    what it was.'

  body: 'Hi James,


    The easiest way is probably to email the program administrator. I''ll do so and
    CC you.


    BTW - ReCap Studio is the product you''re probably talking about, and it''s all
    about working with point cloud (typically laser scan) data. That said, it''s going
    to be increasingly common for people to work with both scan and photogrammetry
    data, it seems, so we''ll see what that means for these two products down the
    line.


    Regards,


    Kean
