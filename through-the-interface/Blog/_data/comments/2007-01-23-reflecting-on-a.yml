  body: I think the reason why Reflector uses the unmanaged reflection APIs is to
    avoid intializing the assembly. Note that prior to .NET 2.0 there was no managed
    way to reflect on an assembly without intializing it. .NET 2.0 provides Assembly.ReflectionOnlyLoad
    but Reflector wants to work with .NET 1.0 and 1.1 too.

  body: 'Very interesting info!


    It is okay to learn from others code, in the case of using it for that purpose.


    I see it, like going to take an exam and having this tool, to almost get the answers,
    so if end up not studing that much, it will be easier in a way to pass it... Sound
    good in theory but not that much in the practice.


    I''ll wait to see the future versions of this technology, for now I just want
    to learn the language...


    Have fun.'

  body: Reflector uses neither the Reflection API or some "unmanaged API". It has
    it's own loader written in managed code that loads the DLL file and decodes the
    information it needs. Not sure about the reasons for this but some obvious candidates
    are file locking (reflector is not locking files on disk), performance, completeness
    (reflection didn't support a bunch of .NET features for the longest time and is
    still missing some) and obviously bugs (Reflector loads a bunch of files that
    Reflection just crashes on).
