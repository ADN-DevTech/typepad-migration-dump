    \ in their organizations, or will Autodesk roll this into a Buzzsaw like service,\
    \ or at the end of the day will they offer it free only I'm hesitant to say ad-based\
    \ as I don't see how displaying ads for other Autodesk products on an Autodesk\
    \ service can be of any benefit.\n\nThanks again,\n jose guia\n cadkicks.com"

  body: 'Jose,


    Nice to hear from you. :-)


    We''ll have to wait and see, although I can certainly confirm that <a href="http://labs.blogs.com/its_alive_in_the_lab/2010/01/saas.html">Autodesk
    is serious about SaaS</a>. We''ll be working closely with customers to understand
    the right deployment/hosting model(s).


    Of the various possible business models available for SaaS, I think it''s more
    likely we''d follow a rental/subscription model rather than charging for ad click-throughs,
    but then I''m not personally involved in any such discussions (this is pure speculation
    on my part).


    Cheers,


    Kean'

  body: With HTML5 coming, would relying on Flash continue to make sense?  Having
    my Autodesk programs delivered similiar to <a href="http://mugtug.com/sketchpad/">http://mugtug.com/sketchpad/</a>
    would be nice!

  body: 'Once HTML5 is actually here (and widely supported), then it might well be
    a good option: based on my discussions with Tal it seems Butterfly''s architecture
    wouldn''t need fundamental re-working for that to happen.


    But that''s far from being a commitment that this is what''s going to happen:
    there may be other reasons not to, for all I know. :-)

  body: 'Kean, what are your thoughts on what kind of changes we can expect in the
    dev world for SaaS. Is the Project Butterfly team considering opening it up to
    some form of extensions, since its in Adobe possibly a modified action script
    of sort.


    Just thinking out loud..'
