  body: 'great post, I did not know about coursera either.

    I totally agree on lifelong learning, and think it has health implications too.
    The number one stumblig block I have seen for modern computers is people do not
    know how to see where their files are in explorer. They rely on magical "library"
    folders and never get that the computer is a file cabinet. A class teaching file
    management is needed by several people I know.
