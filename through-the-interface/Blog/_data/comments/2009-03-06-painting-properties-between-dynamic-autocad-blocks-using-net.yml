    It sounds as though you probably want to send the -OPEN command to open Drawing2.
    I suggest checking out SendStringToExecute() as shown in <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2006/08/calling_command.html">this
    post</a> .

  body: I am having an issue where I insert a dynamic block into a drawing after programmatically
    changing one of its properties.  The block has scaled accordingly but now the
    grips no longer scale the block and changing the property in the properties palette
    does nothing more than move the grips to where they should be but the block still
    stays the same.  This only happens when they property is changed programmatically.  Any
    ideas how to fix this?

  body: To follow up on this issue, when i move the block by its base point, AutoCAD
    shows the preview image(I'm guessing they use a jig) in the size that the block
    is supposed to be according to the grips and the property but when I click again
    to place the block in the new location, it stays the incorrect size.

  body: 'There have been a couple of issues related to programmatic modification of
    dynamic blocks (that I''ve seen).


    The case I used was quite simple - you may hit issues (that are beyond my experience
    to fix) if your blocks are more complex. If you hit issues I suggest posting to
    <a href="http://adn.autodesk.com">the ADN website</a> (if you''re a member) or
    otherwise to <a href="http://discussion.autodesk.com/forums/forum.jspa?forumID=152">the

  body: 'To follow up on this I have the solution, which may help people in the future.  The
    dynamic properties of a block reference can only be edited after the block reference
    has been appended to model space to avoid causing errors.  I edited the property
    for the jig then created a new blockreference with the point selected from the
    jig and added that to model space, then edited its property accordingly.
