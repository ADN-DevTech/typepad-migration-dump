  body: 'Bon voyage, Kean!

    I am already looking forward to this class and all the other Reality Capture related
    stuff going on. I hope I can also make it to the "Meet the experts" panel that
    I really enjoyed last year.


    We will also be demoing a nice little ReCap Photo integration into AutoCAD there.


    See you in Vegas,

    Tilo.'

    I''m definitely looking forward to catching up. Let''s grab a beer at the ADN
    event on Monday night. :-)

    I''m still exploring the possibilities of attending the CAVE evening event as
    well (maybe cloning or 3D printing myself or so...) to ask John Cleese for some
    Monty Python Reunion tickets as I''d been too late on Monday :-('

    just after lunch (when I''m typically free from the DevDay).


    But yes, I would definitely need to send an avatar if I was to see John Cleese
    (aside from CAVE and ADN evening events there''s also the Speaker Dinner and the
    Bloggers'' Social... too much going on!).

  body: Thanks for the review Kean!  I'm curious if you did or if you could try running
    one of the Kinect Fusion examples.  I'm concerned it won't work with the new camera,
    and haven't gotten my hands on one to test myself.

    being worked on...

    I were Microsoft (I assume it''s disallowed by the pre-release agreement, but
    either way I''d have concerns).
