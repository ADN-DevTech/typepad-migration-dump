  body: 'Hi Kean,

    this is a very good example to start with, but for some reason I can''t make it
    work fully.


    The toggle part doesn''t seem to work. Overrule.Overruling stays True, no matter
    what. I''m using AutoCAD 2012.'

    I see the same thing: I''ll forward this to Stephen Preston (the author of the
    code and the right person to get it looked into).


    Thanks for reporting it,


    Kean'

  body: "In the meantime, you can replace the \"else\" class in the TOG command with\
    \ this:\n\n<pre>\n      {\n        // Toggle Overruling on/off\n        Overrule.RemoveOverrule(\n\
    \          RXObject.GetClass(\n            typeof(Line)), _drawOverrule\n    \
    \      );\n        _drawOverrule.Dispose();\n        _drawOverrule = null;\n \
    \     }\n</pre>\n\nThis allows you to essentially toggle \"local\" overruling\
    \ by removing our specific overrule class. We'll see whether this is now the recommended\
    \ approach, or not.\n\nKean"
