  body: When trying to install the Wizard on Visual Studio 2008, Windows 7 operating
    system, I'm getting the error message of "The operation could not be completed.
    The requested operation required elevation" from Visual Studio. Is this a known
    issue? Since I'm using Windows 7 am I out of luck on using the wizard? Thanks.

    "I haven''t tried Windows 7 myself, but I guess it is like Vista. In the readme
    we tell people to temporarily disable the UAC and antivirus in case the antivirus
    blocks VBScripts. That''s all I think would be a problem."

  body: Thanks. Setting the UAC to "Never notify" allowed the program to install.
    As a side note Microsoft appears to have removed the terminology for turning off
    or disabling the UAC from Windows 7.

  body: 'Hi Kean,

    I would like to program in C# for AutoCAD 2008 using Visual Studio 2008.

    Now, for AutoCAD 2008 I need to use the .NET-Framework 2.0, or am I misinformed
    here? Because using this last version of the AutoCAD .NET Wizard I can only select
    the .NET Framework 3.0 or 3.5. If I select 2.0 then I cannot selcet the Wizard
    anymore.

    Is there a Wizard by Autodesk currently available that would support both VS2008
    and ACAD 2008?

    Thanks.'

    this is correct that it does not appear in the Wizards selection dialog if you
    select the ,NET framwork 2.0. That is clearly a mistake in the Wizards descriptor
    file ''MyTemplate.vstemplate'' at (C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio
    9.0\Common7\IDE\ProjectTemplates\CSharp\Autodesk\AutoCAD 2011 plug-in.zip) where
    RequiredFrameworkVersion says 3.0


    There is no risk to create a project with that configuration and later go into
    the project settings to tell to use version 2.0 instead.


    I apologize for the inconvenience,


    Cyrille
