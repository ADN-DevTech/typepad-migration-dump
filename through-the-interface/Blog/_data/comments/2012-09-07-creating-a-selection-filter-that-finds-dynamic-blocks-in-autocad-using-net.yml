    What is the difference between what you have, and using btr.GetAnonymousBlockIds()
    or btr.GetAnonymousBlockIds(bool, bool)?


    Thanks,

  body: 'Hi Brent,


    GetBlockReferenceIds() will give you back all the block references (whether direct
    or nested, depending on the arguments) for a particular block definition.


    The requirement for this post was to provide a selection filter - which can be
    used interactively, even if in this post it''s shown using Editor.SelectAll()
    - to deal with dynamic blocks whose name may have changed due to editing.


    So the code in this post meets a very different need.


    Regards,

    As mentioned via Twitter, I generally answer questions that relate specifically
    to blog posts (which this one does not).


    You might want to check the geometry of the block you''re looking for (e.g. the
    extents and lengths of curves) and then check that against similarly configured
    geometry in the drawing. There would be quite a lot to take into account of not
    just looking for simple "explodes", though.


    Please ask future questions via the online discussion forums.
