  body: "how about recognizing people's face at airport terminals, which can help\
    \ people pick up friends or colleagues at the airport.\n\nthere could be a web\
    \ service like the airplane arrival text messaging thing, people upload photos\
    \ of their friends, relatives, etc. who are arriving at the airport terminal.\
    \ \n\nOnce the pi+webcam+face_recognition picks up the arriving person, a text\
    \ message can be sent to alert."

    of people you don't want to visit you?
