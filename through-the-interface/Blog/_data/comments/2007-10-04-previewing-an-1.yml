  body: "I have tried a great deal of variation on this code (in vb.net) with adjustment\
    \ referenced off the .net discussion groups for autodesk.\n\nI regularly seem\
    \ to have a problem with the medianame and related entry values.\n\nThe most common\
    \ erro would be a eNotValidInput exception from lines similar to:\n  psv.SetPlotConfigurationName(ps,\
    \ \"DWFx ePlot (XPS Compatible).pc3\", \"ANSI_A_8.50_x_11.00_Inches)\");\nSince\
    \ that media name does not exist in my network, i need a concise way to find and\
    \ add an appropriate media to the plotter. Or at least it appears that way.\n\n\
    can you suggest a way to select or iterate the medias available and how best to\
    \ connect them to the plotinfovalidator?\n\nThis is the part or the plotsettingsvalidator\
    \ blow up on me often it seems."

  body: 'I suspect you a) are not using AutoCAD 2008 or b) have not installed the
    DWFx driver mentioned in the post, which should allow you to use this device (and
    I believe the media size).


    I''ll put together and post a quick sample showing how to let the user select
    the device and media via the command-line.

  body: 'Oh, I''ve just noticed you may have a typo in the media name... "ANSI_A_8.50_x_11.00_Inches)"
    should be "ANSI_A_(8.50_x_11.00_Inches)".

  body: 'I''m having the same problem with this article and the simple preview article.  If
    I try to run the routine more than once I get the following: Another plot is in
    progress.


    What is needed to cancel the current plot?


    The other problem I''m having (with my own code) is AutoCAD will freeze in the
    preview.  Any idea what could be causing this?


    Thanks in advance for any help you can offer,

  body: I'm using ACA 2010, and have some odd behavior. If I run the command while
    looking at the Model tab, it fails with eLayoutNotCurrent, because the [LayoutManager.Current.CurrentLayout
    = lo.LayoutName] line won't change it off of model space. If I change to a layout
    and then back to model space and run the command, it gives and access exception
    on that line. Do you think there is any way to work around that?

  body: 'Ok, I think I figured it out. I was running the code from a button that was
    on a pallette, and that pallete was started with the CommandFlags.Session flag.
    That apparrently prevents any use of the LayoutManager.Current.CurrentLayout property
    to change layouts, and alot of memory access exceptions. I changed my button to
    used the SendStringToExecute function to run a command that calls the code instead.
