    Is there a different process for shortening lines, or is it similar syntax?


    Thanks

  body: 'Hi Brent,


    You unfortunately can''t use this approach cirectly to shorten lines: I''m working
    on something that uses GetSplitCurves() instead, and then swaps the original entity
    with one of the results.


    I should be posting something this week.
