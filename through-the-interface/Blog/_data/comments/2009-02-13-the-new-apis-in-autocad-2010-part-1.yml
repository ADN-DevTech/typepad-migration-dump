    the answer is "yes, absolutely." This is left as an exercise for those readers
    requiring (and familiar with) C++, though.

    It looks as though you''re either using a more recent development environment
    than the version of AutoCAD you''re using supports, or you''re targeting a more
    recent version of the .NET Framework.

  body: "Hello Kean,\n\nI tried a portion of your code segment from the create a mesh\
    \ sample but my program had an intention to slice a solid. But I used only this\
    \ segment to grab the Solid3d and assign a variable to it so that I could use\
    \ it in my code. I am using Visual Studio 2010 and AutoCAD 2010.\n\nThe error\
    \ is:\n\nINTERNAL ERROR: !dbobji.cpp@7227:eNotOpenForWrite\n\nI have referred\
    \ back and forth to your sample and the AutoCAD developers guide to solve this\
    \ problem.\n\nHere is the code segment where it throws the error.\n\nDim ed As\
    \ Editor = Application.DocumentManager.MdiActiveDocument.Editor\n\n        Dim\

    \    'Exit sub if user cancelled selection.\n\n        If res.Status <> PromptStatus.OK\

    \ something and then spits out the error.\n\nAny ideas,\n\nTHX,\nDan"
