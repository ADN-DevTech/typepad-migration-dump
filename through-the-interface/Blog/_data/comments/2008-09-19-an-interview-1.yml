  body: Wow! Fantastic stuff here.  Thank you for sharing this with us all. I love
    his comments on comparing programming languages to tools.  I've always believed
    that, but it feels good to hear it from someone of such recognition.  Keep it
    coming.  This is a rare opportunity for us to get an inside view of things.

  body: 'Hi Kean,


    For posterity''s sake... a minor correction to the spelling of two names mentioned
    above, whom I happened to have worked for in the past (though I personally did
    not work on AE/CADD or AEC Mechanical): Rik Jadrnicek and Dennis Neeley. I realize
    you wouldn''t have that from a taped interview; just thought you might want to
    know.

    Thanks! John and I both did our best to verify the spelling of these names, but
    obviously didn''t quite get them right.


    I''ve fixed the post.
