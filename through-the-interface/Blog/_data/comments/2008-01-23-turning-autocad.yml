  body: 'Hi Kean,


    I don''t think this is useless. One idea is to use a RSS feed to update some dynamic
    fields inside a DWG such as: project status, client information or any other information
    that may change during the project development cycle.


    Another use would be a "ToDo" list that the CAD Manager can setup for the week
    or daily tasks to accomplish for all drafters.


    Sometimes the technical solution appears before the idea! :)


    Regards,'

    Thanks - although useless wasn''t exactly the word I used. ;-)


    AutoCAD as a tool for reading blogs isn''t exactly optimal, but you''re absolutely
    right that RSS is much more than just for syndicating blogs: it''s also a great
    transport for project data (for instance). Aside from that the technique shown
    is applicable to all kinds of data that can be accessed via HTTP.


    Regards,
