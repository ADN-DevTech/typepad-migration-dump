    I wholeheartedly agree with that:

    and it''s funny - I had to laugh - comparing it with the bulk of code above. But
    I found at least one big difference: The command "ISOLATEOBJECTS" does not work
    before AutoCAD 2011. (Although the minimum of AutoCAD 2010 for the plugin of June
    also is not much better.)


    For people using AutoCAD before 2010: I once saw a lisp-routine that could isolate
    objects playing with the visibility attribute. However I find this very dangerous
    if you have autosave activated.

  body: 'Yes, ISOLATEOBJECTS is a handy little command. That said, it doesn''t work
    - at least as far as I''m aware - with objects inside blocks and xrefs (let alone
    dimensions in xrefs inside modelspace that you want to check from paperspace).
    Highlighting dimensions in xrefed drawings was a major use case we considered
    for this plugin.


    I also fully expect the Dimension Patrol plugin to be extended over time based
    on user feedback: for instance, I could well imagine a "fix selected dimensions,
    whether in Xrefs or not" command (the eventual naming will clearly need some further
    thought :-) which - while it could be attempted using a more involved LISP application
    - would ultimately be easier to implement using a .NET language.


    Honestly, the above VB.NET code really isn''t complex considering the elegance
    with which it handles dimensions in blocks and xrefs.

  body: "Hi Stephan, you're correct about ISOLATEOBJECTS on vanilla AutoCAD, and there\

    \ might suffice, or you could temporarily place the objects on a new layer and\
    \ lock all other layers and then just discard the drawing or undo those changes.\
    \ \n\nInsofar as putting .NET to good use in this case, one would probably want\
    \ to display a modeless dialog that shows a list of the items that need to be\

  body: Hi Kean.  Most of use generally don't consider dimensions with overridden
    text that include the dimension measurement embedded in the overrriden text (via
    the <> indicator) as potentially corrupt.

    Interesting - thanks for that.


    So you suggest having the overrule not highlight dimensions with text that includes
    "<>"... anything else to watch for?

    The presence of <> means the dimension''s measurement is included in the overriden
    text, and I certainly wouldn''t consider that case to be suspect.


    Anything else aside from misspellings would be very discipline-specific.'

  body: 'Hi Kean,


    Very useful utility (and idea).

    I tried to adapt it to highlight certain values of an AttributeReference. It works
    OK (I mean the highlighting part) except it crashes Acad on each attempt to modify
    (move, rotate, etc.) the containing BlockReference, or use grips on it. This in
    contrast to the DimensionOverrule which is ok for each action performed on it.

    The documentation contains precious little on the subject.

    Any tips?

    Thanks,

    alex'

    It''s hard to say what''s happening here. I suggest posting some code via the
    AutoCAD .NET discussion group or sending it to ADN.
