    You might try asking <a href="http://adn.autodesk.com">ADN</a>, if you''re a member.

  body: 'Here''s an interesting question for you, how would you demand load a .NET
    application if you don''t want that app to load every time you open AutoCAD?


    To be more specific, I have worked in environments that relied heavily on profiles
    to manage different customization schemes.  And as such sometimes we required
    a way to get at AutoCAD in a "vanilla" state (i.e. straight out of the box without
    any customization(s) at all).  Demand loading through the registry doesn''t allow
    for this.


    We came up with a solution that used LISP to make a call to "netload" on those
    profiles that were using the .NET applications.  That way we could very easily
    control which profiles were going to be using our customized apps and which weren''t.


    I am no longer an ADN member (my current job doesn''t interface with AutoCAD enough
    to justify it) but I have been in the past (as recent as 2008).  Even back then
    the ADN folks were baffled why we were doing things the way we were, and as such
    weren''t that helpful.


    I was just wondering what your thoughts would be on this.

    Demand-loading does allow for applications to be loaded when commands they define
    get called by the user. So you could very easily have nothing custom at all be
    loaded on startup, and only choose to load in functionality if invoked via the
    UI (which may or may not provide visible options for doing so, although admittedly
    if someone types the command into the command-line the application would get loaded).


    Now clearly there are profile driven scenarios that may require a different type
    of mechanism. Another way to handle this would be to have a "launcher" application
    temporarily modify the Registry prior to a "vanilla" run to prevent your specific
    customized modules from being loaded during that session, resetting the modified
    Registry keys afterwards.


    There are various ways to address this - it sounds as though the solution you
    found using LISP works well for you, for instance.

  body: 'Using partly your code and ACAD Developer''s guide I tried create registry
    entries (no demand but startup loading) via regasm.exe. Register and unregister
    Subs are included in my assembly, but in this case I have one serious problem  with
    acdbmgd.dll and acmgd.dll, which must be in assembly directory.

    Is there any way how to figure out this issue with no copying libraries? My assembly
    is in ACADM 2011\Plugins\ folder, so target libraries are only two folders above.
    Is it possible to specify the path to the libraries? (e.g. config file)?

    Any ideas?'

    That''s how I ended up being able to build an installer using the RegDL executable:
