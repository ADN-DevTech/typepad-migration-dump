    nice post, it''s always interesting to see out what AutoCAD is capable of!


    You could simplify your code a bit by using this Regex-pattern: "^[A-Z]+([1-9][0-9]*):[A-Z]+([1-9][0-9]*)$"

    It will make sure that no invalid ranges are entered, so you don''t have to check
    afterwards :)


    Best Regards

    Perfect - thanks. It''s obvious in hindsight. :-)


    I''ll leave the post as is - I think the ability to extract grouped characters
    will also be of use to people, even if it''s a little more longwinded for this
    particular scenario.


    Best regards,

    Thanks for this (especially the regular expression, which I had not used in practice
    since using them in school). It turns out there''s something funky with my Excel
    sheet where I can''t use the "A1" cell for this. I don''t know why yet, but other
    than that this works great.


    Thanks,


    Paul'

    Wonder how you are keep posting different categories of posts at the same time
    when someone is really looking for that.


    This post and removing format from pasted excel sheet today helped/saved a lot
    of time for me.


    Also you were right on spot when we were struggling with DGNPurge.


    Thanks !!'
