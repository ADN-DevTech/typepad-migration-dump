    Thanks for reporting the issue - clearly defaulting to the UI behaviour isn''t
    appropriate in this situation.


    A member of my team has submitted it for AutoCAD Engineering to investigate and
    address.

  body: 'Hi all,


    Very good example.

    But since the 2010 version of Autodesk products we have lost in accuracy on the
    boundary created.

    This does not correspond to the reality of the boundary.

    There is the same problem with the standard command "Boundary" et your .NET command


    Sorry for my english.

    If you''re an Autodesk Developer Network member, please submit the issue via <a
    href="http://adn.autodesk.com">the ADN site</a>, so one of my team can look into
    this.


    Otherwise I suggest submitting it via your standard support channel (it also sounds
    as though it may well be a product feature issue, rather than being related to
    the API).

    How would you deal with tracing a boundary when you only have points and no other
    geometry?

  body: 'Hi Ben,


    Do you need some kind of algorithm to find the minimal area of a set of points?


    That''s way beyond the scope of this API, which just detects physical (or, at
    least, existing) boundaries such as those detected by BHATCH.

    Is it possible to use selction set filter like the boundary command, I mean if
    we want only defined layers to be analyzed.

    The capability should only work with visible graphics, so one option would be
    for your application to turn the layers you don''t care about off before running
    the operation.

  body: 'Hi Rusel,


    I have no way of saying what''s wrong - it''s seems to be in some way related
    to the calling context. This kind of issue often occurs because of not locking
    a  document when calling from a modeless dialog, but you mention interop, so it
    could well be something else.
