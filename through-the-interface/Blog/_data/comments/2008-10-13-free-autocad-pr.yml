  body: 'Hi Kean,

    I was lloking through posts, and could not find an answer to this:

    The trim command allows crossing window selection of items within xrefs, as if
    the items are active.

    is there a way to do this with .net?

    I can do individual items no problem, but using windows is a dead end so far,
    I get the whole xref (block) or nothing...thanks'

    namespaces?

    I compile all my lisps to separate namespace vlx files.

    Last time I tried, you could only get at vars set from non-compiled lisps.

    thanks'

  body: 'Hi James,


    I haven''t tried this, myself (at least, not recently), but you might try setting
    PromptSelectionOptions.AllowSubSelections to true. I can''t recall whether it
    works for XRefs.


    Failing that, I''d suggest asking ADN or posting to the discussion group.


    I don''t recall what access is available for variables stored in VLXs - again,
    another good one to ask ADN or post to a forum.


    Regards,
