  body: 'I don''t know of a plan to hold a central, physical event in Europe. Apart
    from the main US event, we have AU China and AU Japan - presumably for language
    reasons - but I know many Europeans travel across to the main AU in Las Vegas.


    Last year we ran <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2009/11/au-2009-classes-both-physical-and-virtual.html">AUv
    and AU Extension</a> events, which were more locally accessible to people. I know
    we''re doing AUv again, and I''d hope the same would be true of AU Extension.
