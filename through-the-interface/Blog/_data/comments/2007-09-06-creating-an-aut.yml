    I haven''t looked into whether MLeaders can be associative to geometry. If it''s
    not available as core functionality, you could certain implement your own associativity
    using events in .NET (probably a comibination of Database.ObjectModified and DocumentManager.DocumentLockModeWillChange).


    I''d suggest posting your question to the discussion groups or asking the ADN
    team (if you''re a member).


    Regards,

  body: 'Whenever I attempt to run your code in Civil-3D 2009, all of the leaders
    come out of the left side of the MLeader.


    If I select and drag the MLeader slightly, it will "recalculate" itself, and display
    as shown in your screen shot, with leaders coming out both sides of the text.  But
    if I simply run the code, all leaders emanate from the left side of the text only.


    If I run your code in Civil-3D 2008, I get the same results as you, with leaders
    coming out both sides of the text.  However, with C3D 2009, they only come out
    the left side.


    Any idea why, or how to get around this issue?  I''d like to create an MLeader
    to the left of a point, and have the leader come out the right side of the text,
    but I can''t seem to manage it in 2009.


    I have tried using the default acad.dwt template, and also "Starting from Scratch",
    just to try to eliminate any possible issues with the template, and I get the
    same result.'

  body: 'This appears to be something different in base AutoCAD 2009 (and therefore
    the products built upon it).


    Adding this line of code forces a recalculation of the MLeader (I put it just
    before the line that commits the transaction):


    mld.MoveMLeader(new Vector3d(), MoveType.MoveAllPoints);


    It essentially moves all the points of the MLeader through a zero-length vector.
    So it does nothing, but the geometry gets corrected.


    I hope this helps you,
