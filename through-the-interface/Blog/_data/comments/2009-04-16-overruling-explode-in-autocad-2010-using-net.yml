    This series is great. I found it a workaround for ObjectArx. I mean, that we can
    control the appearance of the objects without making an ObjectArx in C++.


    Also a great feature is that if you try to render the result of the overrule,
    it works.


    By the way, when it is going to be possible to develope ObjectArx directly on
    C# .NET?


    Thank a lot! RJ.'

    Thanks for the feedback.


    I''m afraid I don''t understand your question, though... what do you mean by "directly
    on C#"?

    kind of wrapper library of ObjectARX for .NET that will help a lot to develope
    custom objects on .NET without going into C++.


    I hope my question is clear now.

    The Overrule API is the preferred way to customize object behaviour if using C#

    First thanks for your job on this pages!


    I have problem with ploting overruled object.

    On model space, all doing good. But in paper space, drawing exceeding viewport
    border, and plot preview and plot show disaster.


    Thanks,

    Robert'

    I know Stephen Preston worked on making sure his display overrule plotted well
    for the DigSigStamp <a href="http://labs.autodesk.com/utilities/ADN_plugins/catalog/">Plugin
    of the Month</a>. You might try taking at look at the source code for that.

    in your posting "Preventing an AutoCAD block from being exploded using .NET" you
    show a way to protect blocks.


    Is there a way to do this with overruling?


    Thanks Jürgen'

    You could place it on a locked layer or even do something silly like redefining
    the EXPLODE command. Overruling is the most elegant approach, IMO, but clearly
    doesn''t work for older versions of AutoCAD.

    thanks for answering. And forgive me I for myself forgot to answer.

    Put it on a locked layer is not a really got solution because the user can change
    the lock-status.

    What I can see is that overuling is not that technic to prefend blocks for exploding.

    Maybe I redefine the explode-command or use the CommandWillStart-event or something
    like that.

    Thank for help.

    This isn''t a big surprise: I wouldn''t expect Entity.Explode() to necessarily
    call the overruled behaviour. You might try contacting ADN (directly ot via the
    AutoCAD .NET Discussion Group) to see what they have to say.

    thanks a lot for this article !

    Works fine, but now I have a question regarding overruled objects and displaying
    them in Navisworks.

    The overrule is only working inside of AutoCAD, so is there a way to show the
    same results in Navis?

    Or is this only possible with "real" Custom Entities?


    Thanks a lot,

    Good question... I don''t know enough about how Navis works (ouch), other than
    that it uses RealDWG and so should be able to load object enablers that can (as
    far as I''m aware) contain overrules. That''s for C++, anyway: I don''t know whether
    it''s able to load .NET DLLs that only link with AcDbMgd.dll in the same way (it''s
    been a while since I did anything with RealDWG).


    A good question for ADN or one of the discussion groups!
