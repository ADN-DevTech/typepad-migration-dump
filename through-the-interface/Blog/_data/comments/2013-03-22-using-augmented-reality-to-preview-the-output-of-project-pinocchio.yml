  body: 'Hi,

    nice works :)

    Anyway...I have a question about texture!!! I have the same problem...PointCloud
    Browser load my .OBJ file but without texture  !

    I have my .OBJ file with .MTL file and a PNG texture.

    How did you solve your problem? Any idea?


    Thanks'

    special to make it work, but that''s the impression I got from loading various
    models. I was using an iPad 2 - I''d expect more recent models to perform better
    (i.e. have a better chance of textures working properly).
