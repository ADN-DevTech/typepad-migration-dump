    I have a vague memory that the ARX Wizard Add-In did this...

    I don''t know wether it''s the right place to post this, but I give it a try :


    I''m looking for an example or some more detailed information about the Exporter
    class from MAP 3D in (VB).NET to export to SHAPE files.

    There is VERY little information in the ObjectARX .NET Developer''s Guide, so
    can someone please direct me to an example of how to implement this ?


    Thanx,

    The ObjectARX Wizards use a document manager reactor to facilitate the use of
    per document data. The same Wizard framework isn''t needed in .NET for two reasons:


    1. If you implement your CommandMethods as non-static functions, then your CommandClass
    is instantiated per document (on first invocation of your command) - so you have
    per document data by default.


    2. Albert implemented the Document.UserData property in the APIto allow per document
    data storage via a hashtable.


    Does that answer your question, or are there other issues you''re trying to address
    with document events?


    Cheers,


    Stephen'

  body: '@Stephen,


    I''m well aware of points 1 and 2, but that''s not really what I was trying to
    get at - my fault.


    I was referring to best practice implementation of ''Document Manager'' events,
    ''Database'' events etc.


    ArxMgdDbg I think it was implemented WatchersOnDuty or some such which planted
    events etc. however I think there are much better ways to implement it. I still
    have a memory of the Arx Wiz and being able to double click an event and it would
    wire up event handlers etc...does that make sense?


    Tony Tanzillo I believe, has a very good Document Data abstract class (or something
    like that) which you can toss in doc data as well as wire up any events you need
    quite nicely.


    I think the community could benefit from some ''best practice'' implemetation/guidelines
    from Autodesk in this area.


    Cheers,

    Glenn.'

  body: The .NET wizards installer only copies a zip file into the ProjectTemplates
    folder, 2 DLL into the GAC, and run the 'devenv /InstallVSTemplates' command.
    So as you can see, we are not installing anything which could affect your system.
    However, that is really curious the problem arise after installing our wizards.
    We tested the .NET wizards installer on 32b and x64 XP and Vista platforms with
    Visual 2008 Express and/or Pro installed on the machine with no problem. So I
    am really curious to know what happened on your side. I just created a new project
    on my side and added a WPF item into it with no problem. Please let me know if
    you could fix the issue,

  body: 'When you invoke the .NET Wizards, there should be a dialog coming asking
    you to select the managed DLL from AutoCAD you want to include, and at the top
    of the dialog there is an edit field which should contain the path to the ARX
    SDK. The reason of this path is to tell Visual Studio where it can find the managed
    DLL, otherwise the project will not load into Visual Studio (you should prefer
    using the managed DLL from the ARX SDK versus the managed DLL from the AutoCAD
    folder because using the ones from AutoCAD otherwise Visual Studio will have problem
    when using the resource editors).


    If you got the error you mentionned, it is certainly because you left the field
    blank. Put "C:\ObjectArx 2010" and it should work. If it still fails, verify your
    copy of the SDK contains a folder named inc-win32.


    Please let me know if that fix the issue,'
