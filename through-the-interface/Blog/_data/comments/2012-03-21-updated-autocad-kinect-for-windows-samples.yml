  body: 'Hi Tony,


    Yes - I got sent these two articles on Leap, this morning, so it''s clearly creating
    some buzz:


    <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-11386_3-57437404-76/leap-motion-3d-hands-free-motion-control-unbound">Leap
    Motion 3D: hands-free motion control, unbound</a>

    <a href="http://www.core77.com/blog/ux/must-see_video_gesture_control_accuracy_takes_a_huge_leap_forward_22494.asp">Must-See
    Video: Gesture Control Accuracy Takes a Huge "Leap" Forward</a>


    I expect Microsoft will end up shipping something to support finger-detection
    at some point (whether or not it needs a new sensor remains to be seen) - and
    apparently the 1.5 version of their Kinect SDK is due next month, so who knows
    what that will contain - but it''s clear they haven''t been quick to capitalise
    on the desktop control opportunity.


    It''ll be interesting to see whether Leap lives up to its promise (the demo video
    looks very cool). I do wish the articles discussing the topic didn''t always take
    such a critical view of Microsoft (to the point of being factually incorrect,
    in CNET''s case), but I suppose that''s the way of things.

    Enhancements include facial and seated skeletal tracking (but still no finger
    tracking).


    It seems Leap Motion won''t be shipping anything until the end of the year, so
    we''ll see if MS can get their act together, in the meantime.

  body: "I wouldn't put my money on MS and Kinect for PC's here, because its not really\
    \ about the device or the fact that it's 100x more accurate than anything else\
    \ out there right now, it's mostly their software that makes it happen. From what\
    \ I've seen and read, they are years ahead of Microsoft and everyone else, for\
    \ that matter. \n\nIgnoring the $70 price tag for a moment, and considering only\
    \ what that device is capable of (with supporting software) really puts it in\
    \ a different class than Kinect and other gaming-oriented motion sensing systems.\n\
    \nThey also didn't take a proprietary route like Microsoft did at first with Kinect,\
    \ and they now have the backing of 20,000 developers, and seem to understand that\
    \ developer support is the key."

  body: 'Indeed. Ultimately Kinect wasn''t targeted at close, desktop-oriented work
    (which really seems a sweetspot for depth-sensing technology), and it doesn''t
    look like they''re shifting gears quickly enough to address the need.


    I''d be very happy to see a player such as Leap deliver what''s needed for short-range
    NUI development, providing they manage to place adequate focus on building and
    servicing the eco-system.


    They''ve pulled off a great launch - it''ll be interesting to see how they manage
    things from here.

  body: 'Well, maybe. From what I understand it''s unlikely to be as good with arbitrary
    objects (there''s some kind of reference model being matched). Although that doesn''t
    explain the chopstick, of course, unless there''s a model of that being matched
    for the demo.


    Either way the tech is very cool - it just remains to be seen how we''ll all be
    able to use it.
