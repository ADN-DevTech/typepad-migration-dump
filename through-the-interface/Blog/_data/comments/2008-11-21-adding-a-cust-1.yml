  body: "<code>\nprivate static void OnCancel()\n{\n  // Not currently doing anything\
    \ here\n}\n</code>\n\nWell, I see one minor issue with this. \n\nIf the user clicks\
    \ the Cancel button on the Options dialog, any changes they made should be discarded,\
    \ but in the case of your example, that wouldn't occur.\n\nThe solution is quite\
    \ simple however. In the OnCancel() method, just deserialize the settings class\
    \ from storage, which causes its state to revert back to when the Options dialog\
    \ was shown, or the Apply button was last clicked.\n\nThe other issue worth noting,\
    \ is user-specific verses system-specific settings. Saving to the location of\
    \ the assembly implies the settings are not user-specific.\n\nFor user-specific\
    \ settings, one can use the properties of System.Windows.Forms.Application to\
    \ get the folder where user settings are normally stored (there's other ways as\
    \ well, including via the HostApplicationServices class).\n\nIt might also pay\
    \ to look into the framework's 'official' mechanism for persisting application\
    \ settings (The 'Settings' tab in the Project Designer).\nThe Settings designer\
    \ tab and the System.Configuration namespace make it relatively easy to persist\
    \ application settings and also have them automatically applied to interface elements\
    \ (through the use of WinForms DataBinding) for cases where a user can configure\
    \ things like fonts, colors and so on."

  body: 'Very good point, Tony: we should really be calling Load() from OnCancel().
    An oversight on my part. I''ve fixed the post.


    And thanks for pointing out another approach for this - I''m sure people will
    find that helpful.

    I remember having problems with launching new forms from custom tabbed dialog,
    which is quite common (i.e. browse for file/folder dialog). But that was pre-2009.
