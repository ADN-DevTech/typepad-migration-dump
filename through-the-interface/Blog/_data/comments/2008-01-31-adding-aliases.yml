  body: 'Mr. Walmsley,

    I hope you don’t mind if I post this question for you. I''m the CAD Manager of
    a Civil Engineering firm. We''re currently using Civil 3D 2008 and Land Desktop
    Companion 2008 with service pack 2. An employee that used to work with us still
    helps out when available. He is a programmer. He has written an application which
    he installed on the 2002 products and upgraded to the 2006 products. He has come
    across a problem trying to tweak this application and get it to work with our
    2008 products. Programming is not my strong point. Is there anyway I could email
    you the document where he describes in programming language his issues, and hopefully
    you can lead us in the right direction? I''m not sure how to attach it here. Any
    help is greatly appreciated.


    Thanks

    Jason'

    Frankly, I doubt I''ll be able to help: I have little to no knowledge of either
    LDT or Civil 3D development.


    The best source of help is likely to be the <a href="http://discussion.autodesk.com/forum.jspa?forumID=190">Civil
    3D Customization Discussion Group</a>, or the <a href="http://adn.autodesk.com">ADN
    website</a> - where you can submit your questions if you happen to be an ADN member.


    You can certainly email me the document, in case I happen to be able to help off
    the top of my head, but unfortunately I don''t have the luxury of being able to
    spend time working on this type of issue, myself.


    Regards,

    You can also use the REINIT command to reload the PGP file after you change it.  I
    use this command quite a lot, which saves me from closing all my drawings and
    restarting Autocad after I make some changes.


    Have a good day.

    Thanks for your quick response. I have posted on the dicussion group and am waiting
    for responses. I totally understand you not having enough time to dig in to this
    problrm. I still appreciate your feedback. Even though programming is not my strong
    point, I think you have an interesting blog. Again, thanks. Take it easy.

  body: Starting in 2006?, the pgp file can be edited from Express/ Tools/ Command
    Alias Editor. Not only does this allow edits on the fly, but when the ap closes
    it updates your current session. Also changes made to your pgp in a text editor
    do not migrate to new versions, saving time in getting started out of the box.
    Personally I find it much easier to use. The Command Alias Editor also allows
    you to scroll lists of available commands and abbreviatons/ aliases to add/ modify/
    or remove.

  body: 'hello,

    I am recently having a trouble with adding alias to my custom command(command
    works fine when added as a new button to tool palette)


    so here''s my problem described further:

    I''ve created new custom comman called "cu" using cui editor. I don''t know if
    it matters but source of the command was set to "ACAD".


    Name: CUcs

    Desctiption: turns ucs & plan around z axis

    Extended hlp file: (blank)

    Command Disp. name: CUcs

    Macro: ^C^CUCS Z \\PLAN C ^C

    Tags: (blank)

    Element ID: MMU_CU


    After that I''ve added alias to acad.pgp

    <b>CU,*CUcs</b>


    I''ve done reninit but I still get error:

    <i>cu Unknown command "CUCS".</i>


    I''m using Autocad 2009 (''non LT'')

    Any suggestions on the issue Guys?

    Thanks in advance'

  body: 'The CUI editor doesn''t actually define commands in the way you expect: such
    named commands can be added to menus, toolbars and ribbons, but it doesn''t mean
    the new name will be callable via the command-line.


    The PGP would work fine with this:


    CU, *UCS


    But then you really want to specify a command string for the UCS command.


    The simplest way to achieve this would probably be via a simple LISP command:


    (defun CUCS()(command "_.UCS Z \\PLAN C"))


    (Although the string you''ve provided above seems a bit strange - perhaps there
    are characters missing because of the HTML comment editor.)

  body: 'Why am I getting "unknown command", if I set CopyLocal of acad DLLs to false
    (VC# Express 2010, ACAD 2012)? Strange thing - it only happens when I include
    initialization (public class MyInit : IExtensionApplication) in the code. If not
    - the command is executed properly. But I really need Initialize()...

    More strange things - as I can remember, it started when I changed ACAD from 2011
    to 2012.'
