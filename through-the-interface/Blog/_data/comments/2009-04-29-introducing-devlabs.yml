  body: 'Yes, it''s open to all levels, although - as mentioned - you should not come
    along expecting to get training.


    If you are fine with getting a modest amount of attention/guidance - and not dedicated
    mentoring - during the period you''re with us, then that''s fine.

  body: 'That sounds great (and generous - free as in free beer?), as it certainly
    can help people get their problems solved - you''ll need large conference rooms
    for those DevLabs.

    You do not happen to plan for opening an office in southern Germany? ;-)'

  body: "Kean,\n Will there be any plans to do one at the office in Novi, Michigan\
    \ where a lot of the development and design is done for the MSD product line?\
    \ I think you would have a great turn out there. I would be there for sure."

    We''re certainly open to the idea of doing these at different Autodesk offices,
    assuming these first ones prove successfully and we can manage the costs to a
    reasonable level. Neither Novi nor Munich are out of the question, by any means,
    for future DevLabs.


    Another reason we''re running the trials where we have local staff is that we
    can more easily adjust our attendance (adding or removing members of DevTech depending
    on the number and profile of attendees). Once we''ve done a few we''ll hopefully
    know enough to hold these further afield.


    Please keep the suggestions coming!
