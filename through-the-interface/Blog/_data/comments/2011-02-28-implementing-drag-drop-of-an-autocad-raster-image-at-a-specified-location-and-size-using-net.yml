  body: "Hi Kean,\nthanks for the DRAGDROP command.\n\nI'm uncertain why you left\
    \ in the call to <tt>ed.PointToWorld()</tt> in the latest version, since all points\
    \ will be selected interactively now after the drop operation. After removing\
    \ that I ran into an error with the \"near zero size\", since it is effectively\
    \ zero size and the <tt>ri.Orientation</tt> property can't be set to that value.\
    \ I'd suggest guarding the <tt>RasterJig.Update()</tt> method with a test against\
    \ zero length of the diff vector like this:\n<pre>\n      Vector3d diff = _end\
    \ - _start;\n      if (diff.Length > 0.0) {\n         ...\n      }\n</pre>"

  body: 'Hi Thorsten,


    Thanks for the comment.


    The drag operation is still reponsible for the initial placement, so I think we
    do need to keep the PointToWorld() call, but you''re right that we no longer need
    to calculate a displacement vector (disp), as the jig takes care of that piece.


    And yes - I missed putting a check on diff, so it''s good you found that.


    Regards,


    Kean'

  body: "Hi Kean,\n\nGoing through this code I found a minor error:\n\n  237     \
    \  PromptPointResult ppr = ed.GetPoint(ppo);\n  238       if (pr.Status != PromptStatus.OK)\n\
    \  239         return;\n\nInstead of looking at the point prompt by using ppr.Status\
    \ we are looking at the string prompt using pr.Status\n\nThanks for this example!"
