    catch { throw; }


    Because, he finally{} block runs regardless of how control leaves the try{} block.'

  body: 'The throw isn''t to stop the finally clause from executing (far from it -
    I want that to execute to get rid of our progress meter), it''s to make sure the
    exception gets passed on to the calling function.

  body: 'Hi Kean,

    this reminds me of a technique used to find the centreline between two polylines,
    the centreline of a 2d closed object or a 3d object.

    See Jeff Saunders rolling ball lisp for a better explanation. <a href="http://www.jefferypsanders.com/autolisp_Rollin.html">http://www.jefferypsanders.com/autolisp_Rollin.html</a>

    This may show a useful implementation of your code.

    Interesting - thanks.


    At one point I did try testing geometry intersections to adjust position (if not
    radius) of the spheres, but I prefer not to have to as it improves performance
    significantly.


    Cheers,

    your code would provide another solution, and that this is another use for your
