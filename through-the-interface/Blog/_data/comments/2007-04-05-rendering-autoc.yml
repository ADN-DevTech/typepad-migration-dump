    Which version of AutoCAD/ObjectARX is needed to run this example?


    Thanks for sharing with us your knowledge ;-)

    My apologies - I keep forgetting to put that information in my posts &lt;sigh&gt;.


    This code uses API functionality that was introduced in AutoCAD 2007.

    To the best of my knowledge, the Graphics System has not been exposed through
    COM. So an ObjectARX or .NET component will be needed to implement this function
    (which can then be called from VBA, should you so wish).

    The code View gsv = doc.GraphicsManager.GetGsView(vpn, true) gets only the top
    position of the view. How can I get the current 3D view to render?


    If I draw a 3D box instead of a sphere, view.RenderToImage() always renders at
    the top position, so I don''t see the 3D view of this box.


    Thank you,

    Khoa'

    That should be getting the view based on the active viewport (as pointed to by
    the CVPORT system variable).


    You might also look at SetViewFromViewport(), which may prove useful.


    You may want to post your follow-up question to the AutoCAD .NET Discussion Group,
    in case someone there can help.

    SetViewFromViewport() works only on current view on screen, does not work on view

  body: 'Hi Antonio,


    It should be: the ACAD_MATERIAL dictionary just contains AcDbMaterial objects
    (which are Autodesk.AutoCAD.DatabaseServices.Material objects in .NET) that have
    Xrecords in their Extension Dictionaries for various properties (and presumably
    just calling the object''s methods will cause these to be created).


    So you should be able to create your own materials programmatically: if you want
    to launch some kind of existing import command programmatically (I don''t know
    if one exists) then that''s a different question.
