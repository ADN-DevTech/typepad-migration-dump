    I found another problem with the first suggestion (Editor.GetNestedEntity() +
    PointMonitor) which lies in the use of keywords. If I add keywords to the "outer"
    PromptNestedEntityOptions (the one that lies outside the PointMonitor), they do
    appear at the command line but, whenever I select one of them, instead of getting
    a "PromptStatus.Keyword", I''m getting a "PromptStatus.Cancel", and the StringResult
    property is also null.'

    That''s not very surprising (but good to know). The dynamic input tooltip issue
    was just the first indicator of some state being impacted. Best not to go there...

    I am looking into the possibility of the programmatical creation of blocks and
    dynamic blocks. So far I haven''t been able to figure out in which table the objects
    that make the blocks dynamic: alignment grip, parameters, actions. I don''t know
    what their object class either.'

    The last time I checked it wasn''t possible to create dynamic blocks programmatically.
    But you should post to ADN or the AutoCAD .NET Discussion Group, as someone there
    may know better.


    Non-dynamic blocks are easier, of course. Just populate a new BlockTableRecord
    with the entities you want to include and add it to the BlockTable.

  body: Thanks for the reply and happy new year to you. Now I know that it's not possible
    but I'm curious as to why, is it because of unexposed Acad features? One more
    question, is it possible to create useable Acad-object hash numbers in order to
    compare the objects? Any other way to compare acadDB objects besides property
    by property? Thanks.

    This isn''t a support form: please do ask your follow-up questions via ADN or
    the discussion groups.


    I don''t recall the history on the dynamic blocks question, I''m afraid. And comparing
    objects - determining when objects are equivalent despite certain properties being
    different (or reversed) is an application category in itself (there are a number
    of "drawing compare" apps in the Exchange Store, for instance).

    Can this code be applicable in the case of ''overrule''?

    Is there a way to select/move primitives drawn under overrule.


    Thanks.

    You could presumably capture the overruled graphics being generated and do some
    analysis to determine whether the object is being hovered over... it might get
    complicated but should be possible.
