  body: 'Hi Christophe,


    It was nice to meet you, too.


    I wrote and tested this code for/with AutoCAD 2009: I don''t know at what point
    WorldGeometry2 was introduced but it may have been as recent as with this release.


    If you''re using an older release, then that''s probably the issue.


    Regards,


    Kean'

    It might be worth noting that jig draggng occurs in multiple viewports.


    With multiple viewports having different view orientations, I think you may need
    to use ViewportDraw() to acheive the desired result in all viewports.'

    folded into the WorldGeometry class. Try commenting out the cast and see if it
    works.
