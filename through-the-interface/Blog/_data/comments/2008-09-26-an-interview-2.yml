    I can''t close my browser until I''ve finished the article :-)

  body: 'Good articles. What I wish Autodesk would see at this point, is that the
    user base has matured. Its not new features that drive sales, its stability, and
    the dwg format.

    You keep adding features little by little, and change the dwg format every three
    years like you are now, and sales and subscription will keep up.

    You continue to junk up the core acad with things that barely work on their own,
    and mess up the verticals, and it creates momentum against Autocad and Autodesk
    itself.

    Who can tell if things junk up the core?  Its experienced people like long time
    cad managers that have done production. I''m seeing those people make critical
    comments that affect usability that are completely being ignored, and that''s
    at beta time.  They need to get those people involved early on in feature design.

    I''m specifically thinking of the modeless layer and xref dialogs, very sad what
    has happened there on several levels.  Seems like no one bothered to look at how
    going modeless affects the patterns of use.

    So the Adesk employees can make acad do just about anything, its choosing what
    to do and getting the details and stability right before releasing.

    You get that right and the stock prices and the business in general will do just
    fine.  Flimsy new features do not help sell acad, its too expensive.  People buy
    it because they need it as a whole, not because of the yearly bloat as it is becoming.

    Thanks for your comments.


    One thing you will hopefully find in some way encouraging is the fact we''re increasingly
    basing design decisions for our software on <a href="http://autodesk.blogs.com/between_the_lines/2008/09/autodesk-resear.html">actual
    product usage data</a>.


    This - in combination with the data we continue to gather in a variety of ways
    during the product cycle - makes me confident you''ll see better and better design
    decisions made by our Engineering teams.


    Regards,


    Kean


    P.S. This was hopefully just the first of a number of interviews I plan on performing
    & publishing. The next is with someone from a very different domain, though...
    watch this space. :-)
