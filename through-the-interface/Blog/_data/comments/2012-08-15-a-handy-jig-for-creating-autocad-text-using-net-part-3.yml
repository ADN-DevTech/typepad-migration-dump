  body: 'Hi Heinz,


    Absolutely - it was in the original "spec" to have the text react on a single
    keystroke. So far I''ve used the standard keyword mechanism - which requires the
    user to hit Enter to terminate the input - but perhaps there''s a way to intercept
    that via a hook and send the Enter automatically.


    I''ll take a quick look and see what might be done.


    Regards,


    Kean'

  body: 'Hi Kean.  I have a couple of special jigs that respond to the Tab key.  One
    toggles a boolean back and forth which is responded to in the jig by changing
    the direction of a curve (clockwise, or counterclockwise).  The other sequences
    through an enum, which the jig responds to by using that enum to display one of
    four different block configurations.


    it uses a System.Windows.Forms.iMessageFilter and catches the TAB in the PreFilterMessage
    function.  Something I learned from you ;)'

  body: 'Hi David,


    And that''s almost certainly how I''d have implemented it, right there. ;-)


    I''ll start working on Part 4 to integrate some single keystroke commands, later
    this week.


    Cheers!

  body: 'HI tanks for this Jig. I am not used to use a jig but it is a good example
    for me.


    I want to add the option for create the rotation with a second Point. The rotat90
    is not usefull for me. I need a rotation for align the text with a polyline so
    i have to click on the first point, select the left align and after that i have
    to click on the 2° point for rotate the text for align.


    thanks'

    Thanks for the suggestion. It''s unfortunately beyond the scope of this particular
    sample, but this post may be of use to you:
