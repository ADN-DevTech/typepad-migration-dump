    Thank you for your reply.

    Actually I''m trying to write a program,that  when it''s unloaded,all the objects
    become proxy objects. Adding kind of security that  make all my objects inivisible
    without my program loaded. I think I should use proxy object and entity but I
    dont know how?!


    Thank you

    Proxies only get created for custom objects, not for standard entities. If you
    want to impose some kind of security on your data, then there are better ways
    to get there than by going down the path of implementing custom objects for everything
    in your application (potentially a lot of work).


    One option would be to store no graphical data at all in your DWG file and re-create
    it all on the fly. The non-graphical data used to define your objects could then
    be stored in the DWG (in the Named Objects Dictionary) or in an external database.

    I''m testing on AutoCAD 2009 - there have probably been changes since AutoCAD
    2007. You were right to remove that line - it shouldn''t be the cause of the problem.


    As you have a solution, I suggest going with that, but as you support a more recent
    AutoCAD version you may want to adjust the code accordingly.

    i use autocad 2006, and would like to know,if i can create a drawing (eg: dress
    pattern) and be able to modify by using a table or dialog box ,by entering (eg:
    hip, waist, shoulders)in the box and having the actual drawing change to match
    the measurments placed in the table.

    ive heard about LISP commands, could this work if so how? can u show basic eg?

    AutoCAD currently doesn''t do this out-of-the-box, so you would have to implement
    some kind of application.


    I suggest posting to one of <a href="http://discussion.autodesk.com ">the Autodesk
    discussion groups</a>, to see if someone there has some suggestions.

    I found sometime the actual RowHeight adjusted to fit the text height, not the
    value you set. For example, when I set the RowHeight=5 and TextHeight=3, the actual
    RowHeight is set to 7 not 5, but when I change the TextHeight to 1, the actual
    RowHeight is 5. I didn''t find any properties or methods to fix the row height.
    Any suggestion?

    Thanks.'

    I''m going to post something soon (hopefully in the coming weeks) related to Cell
    Styles. You may want to look them up in the AutoCAD product help, to get some
    understanding of them. It may be that these are more effective that setting the
    text/row height directly (although I need to look into this further).

    > Could you explain why?


    Nope, sorry. Because there''s no particular reason I did this: I might have just
    as effectively used the TransactionManager from the Database.


    One might argue I probably should have, as it might make logical sense to use
    the transaction manager from the "lowest" point in the object model, but in (this)
    reality there''s no practical difference in having done so.


    So you can consider this a slip of the keyboard, but an insignificant one. :-)
