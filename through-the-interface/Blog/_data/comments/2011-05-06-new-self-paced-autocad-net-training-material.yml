  body: 'Kean,

    I think Autodesk has done well showing how to use .net.  the thing that seems
    like a gap to me is how to organize projects and solutions in .net.  You can only
    go so far by having all code present in a given project, so you would want to
    set up libraries of classes and things to re-use in other solutions. Then comes
    the subject of dependency and namespaces.  I would be interested in hearing from
    your teams on how they split things up, and how they would recommend others do
    it if working in small teams.  What are the driving rules for why they would do
    what they recommend. That would help the average programmer get over the initial
    hump of starting with .net.'

  body: 'Hi James,


    I don''t believe what you mention has anything in it that is specific to Autodesk.
    If it helps at all, our AutoCAD developers follow the Microsoft guidelines for
    class library development (we don''t write our own rulebook). Try searching MSDN
    for something like "Design Guidelines Class Library" and you''ll find some useful
    links.


    Cheers,

  body: I found the box in the settings that sais "always atomatically create a plot
    log" and I deselected the box. So now about half the time I plot or everytime
    I create a pdf, AutoCAD creates a plot log. This just adds extra junk to my files
    and some of these folders are public. Is there a way to set up AutoCAD 2008 to
    never create a plot log.

    out how to change it).


    Also, I suggest using a different name/URL to post to this blog: the ones you''ve
    used makes your comments look like SPAM.

    Hopefully someone there will be able to help.
