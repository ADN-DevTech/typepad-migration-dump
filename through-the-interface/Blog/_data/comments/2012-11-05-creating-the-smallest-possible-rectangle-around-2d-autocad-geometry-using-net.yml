    To find the bounding box in 2D, I should think that Graham''s scan is significantly
    more efficient and above all precise, with no iteration required, than the algorithm
    you are using:

  body: 'Hi Jeremy,


    Which algorithm do you mean: the one for the circular or rectangular boundaries?


    As far as I can tell you need to sort the points as part of the Grahan scan algorithm,
    so it''s not clear what I''d be gaining, performance-wise (I don''t need the convex
    hull for the rectangular boundary - just the min and max in X and Y).


    Please respond by email - I''ll follow up with a comment to summarise the exchange
    (assuming there''s something further of value).


    Cheers,

  body: 'Just to close this off... it turned out it didn''t make sense to do a Graham
    scan, but the discussion did highlight that I''d left in a slightly lazy bit of
    code that used LINQ to iterate the list of points four times to get the min/max
    coordinates.


    I''ve now switched back to a good old for loop to do that in a single pass.

    Why not a Extents3d structure, add points to it and get the min/max points?, or
    I''m missing something?

  body: 'Hi Gaston,


    Mainly because we''re not actually interested in the 3D extents: the code projects
    points (which may or may not be 3D) onto the plane of the UCS, and then takes
    their 2D extents relative to that. I suppose we could have made something work
    via the Extents3d object (Extents2d doesn''t offer the same capabilities) but
    it seemed better to do it this way.

    Actually, the LINQ Aggregate() method was designed to solve precisely that type
    of problem. And as a bonus, if you give it the result of calling AsParallel()
    on the input sequence, it will produce a result in about 1/3 the time that the
    good old sequential ''for'' loop requires.'

    Oops, sorry if that was a bit presumptuous, but that performance gain assumes
    one has 4 or more CPU or cores that are not busy.'

  body: "Hi Kean,\n\nIt's been a useful post and I've worked with the code for DBText.\
    \ \n\nI noticed that the ExtractBounds ignore the IsMirroredInX & IsMirroredInY\
    \ properties.\n\nSince these properties are already taken into consideration into\
    \ the Bounds property, it's pretty easy to implement them with a couple of modifications:\n\
    \nprivate static void ExtractBounds(DBText txt, Point3dCollection pts)   \n{\n\
    ...\ntxt2.IsMirroredInX = txt.IsMirroredInX;\ntxt2.IsMirroredInY = txt.IsMirroredInY;\n\
    ...\nPoint3d maxPt = txt2.Bounds.Value.MaxPoint;\nPoint3d minPt = txt2.Bounds.Value.MinPoint;\n\
    \nPoint2d[] bounds = new Point2d[] {new Point2d(minPt.X, minPt.Y),new Point2d(minPt.X,\
    \ maxPt.Y),new maxPt.X, maxPt.Y),new Point2d(maxPt.X, minPt.Y)};\n...\n}\n\nThe\
    \ rotation should still be based on Point.Origin.\n\nRegards,\n\nLambros"

    You need to copy & paste the source code into Visual C# Express (or Visual Studio,
    if you have it), inside a Class Library project, then add a few project references
    (<a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2006/07/getting_started.html">see
    here for more info</a>) before building a .DLL you can NETLOAD into AutoCAD.


    I hope this helps,
