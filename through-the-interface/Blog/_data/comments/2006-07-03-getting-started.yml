    Great post, I''m new in developing programs in Visual Studio for using in Autocad
    and I would like to know the other way around, i.e, if it''s possible to programme
    in .NET in the AutoCad environment...until now we had had always to use VBA or
    LISP, but I don''t know if we can use VB.NET and use all the power of the .NET
    Framework in Autocad.

    You can absolutely use Visual Studio - even one of the Express Editions - to write
    managed assemblies that load and run inside AutoCAD.


    There currently isn''t an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) inside AutoCAD
    that supports .NET development (such as VSTA - Microsoft''s version of Visual
    Studio that can be embedded by applications), but that shouldn''t stop you from
    writing and debugging .NET code inside AutoCAD.

    This question comes up from time to time (which makes me think it deserves a dedicated

    You have a choice: you can use the LispFunction attribute to create a LISP-callable

    - or otherwise you can use the Get* functions (as described in <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2007/05/its_all_in_the_.html?cid=145382980#comment-145382980">this
