  body: Is there a way to control this option within CAD, or add it into the Osnap

  body: Also, is there a compatible text symbol for 1/3? 1/2 and 1/4 are recognized
    by AutoCAD, but if I pull 1/3 out of the character map, it isn't recognized by
    CAD (Just shows up as a question mark on the line).

  body: 'The Object Snap dialog isn''t customizable, so you can either tie it to another
    mode (check the setting to see whether that is enabled) or implement your own
    application settings UI.


    I used to use "1/3" (three characters, not one) for the "third" osnap glyph. "Half"
    and "quarter" are more likely to be available, as they''re standard ASCII. I don''t
    believe "1/3" (one character) is, though. If you''re using three characters centering
    the text is likely to become more important.

    I actually gave up on trying to do custom osnaps in .NET because the glyphs that
    you draw via viewportDraw() do not go away, and you end up with them littering
    the view.


    Any ideas on how to make them behave more like AutoCAD''s built-in osnap markers
    (which disappear when you move out of the range of the aperture target)?'

    When the problem occurred my glyphs were blue, rather than yellow, in case that
    helps confirm the behaviour.

    How will you implement the above code in AUTOCAD?

    Is the code common for all the versions of the AUTOCAD.

    Let me know how customization & implementation  can be done through coding in
    AUTOCAD.

    Looking for reply.....'

  body: 'I know this is an ancient post Kean, but kudos on the implementation.  I
    was able to rip through this in about an hour and a half and implement a custom
    osnap that snaps to points stored in the xdata of a block reference during a custom
    polyline jig (also mostly ripped from you).

    For anybody else going down this type of transient lifetime path, I found it useful
    to inherit from IDisposable rather than IExtensionApplication so that my snaps
    were only enabled during the intended command with a using statement and also
    disabled other snaps during the process.

    Thanks'

  body: 'Kean,

    On a very similar note, where would you start if you wanted to use osnap tracking
    from a point on a polyline being jigged similar to what you''ve done with <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2006/11/controlling_int_1.html">http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2006/11/controlling_int_1.html</a>
    ?

    From comparing this routine with the actual pline command it seems that pline
    may be adding each segment to the database as they''re input, I''m guessing this
    is the route to take but any thoughts would be great!

    Thanks'

    Making the jigged polyline database resident is probably the way to go, in this
    case (and shouldn''t change the structure of the jig much, at all). I''ve used
    this approach in a few different jigs, but not specifically to address this osnap
    issue. I assume it would work, though.
