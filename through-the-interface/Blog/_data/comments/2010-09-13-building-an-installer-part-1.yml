  body: 'Hi Kean,


    This looks really useful, but would you consider extending the upcoming series
    of posts for those of us who don''t have the full version of Visual Studio? (I
    personally use InnoSetup for my Inventor add-ins.)


    Regardless, I have been wondering how to create an installer for AutoCAD that
    I can deploy to our network, so I will follow the posts that follow this one with
    interest.


    Thanks,


    Alex.'

    I don''t think I''ll be able to cover the various alternative environments out
    there, myself, but I''d hope that the concepts I show in this series will also
    apply to other installer technologies (although the details may change).


    Let''s see how things look at the end of the series. :-)


    Cheers,
