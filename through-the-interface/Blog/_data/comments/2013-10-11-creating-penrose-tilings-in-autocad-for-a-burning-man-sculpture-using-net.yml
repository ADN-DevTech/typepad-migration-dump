    \ from automation.  Iterating through progressive patterns done by hand could\
    \ drive a CAD tech mad.\n\nI had heard about the Burning Man festival from a local\
    \ sculpture: Based on the Flickr gallery it looks like an event worth a trip some\
    \ year.\n\nHeirloom value notwithstanding, that sculpture would make a really\
    \ cool lawn ornament for this upcoming Halloween. \n-----"
