  body: If using GetGsView() to create a view, it will show 3D UI background. How
    can we solve this problem? Thanks!

  body: Thie above code doesn't use AutoCAD's GS View directly - it just gets the
    view parameters from it. You should be fine if you follow the above example, creating
    a new View and using what you need from AutoCAD's.

    I do not want users to konw the background change. What can I do?

    one more question.

    How can I get the snap shot in the paper space?

    Thanks again!'

    As for taking a snapshot of paperspace, just try adding it to the view instead
    of the modelspace.'

  body: 'Ok, I am trying to make my question clear.

    when you use GetGsView() to get the view with visual style 2dwireframe, do you
    find the acad background color is changed from black to gray?

    What can we do to avoid this change?

    Wish clear enough this time.

    Thanks!'

    Yes - calling GetGsView(vpn, true) will create a new 3D GS View, if one doesn''t
    already exist. The default colour for these views'' background is grey. If you
    pass false as the second argument, the view will not get created if it doesn''t
    exist (it will be null), which means we can''t use it to get/set the view parameters.


    The good news is that there''s a function that does just that (one that I had
    missed). You can replace all the GetGsView()-related code with this line, which
    comes after we create the View object:


    gsm.SetViewFromViewport(view, vpn);


    This seems to have the same result as the previous code, with the added benefit
    of not creating a new 3D View with a grey backrgound to disturb your users. :-)


    I''ll create a new post with the updated code sometime next week.


    Thanks!'

  body: 'Great! It works.

    I got a black rectangle area in the snapshot when I create a new view with layout
    in paper space. The black area seems like the viewport in the layout. Could you
    provide some ideas to me?

    Thanks in advance!
