  body: 'Hi Kean,


    would that work for 3D solids and Surfaces(Meshes,  NURBS, analytic etc...)?

    A simple code example would be then very helpful!


    Thanks'

  body: 'Hi Konstantin,


    With this approach you have to encode the information needed to generate the object
    in a string. For certain objects capturing and reusing this is hard, which is
    why I chose to focus on Polylines (as on the one hand they''re popular, they''re
    relatively simple and can be used to build more complex objects, such as surfaces).


    Regards,
