  body: hey I've got a zippy joystick and I'm trying to hook mine up to an arduino
    but I'm having trouble would you mind emailing me your wiring schematics and code
    for me to take a look at?

  body: 'I was worried someone might ask that. I don''t even have a napkin sketch
    of the schematics - it was all just thrown together. And the code is very basic:
    the pins providing power need to be switched on and that''s it.
