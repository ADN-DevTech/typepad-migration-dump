    Thanks!


    Traditionally there are a few ways to go about this. You would create an MNU file
    and load that, or use the COM API to add menu items.


    These days, the recommended approach is using CUI. Here are a couple of posts
    that may be of use to you: <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2006/11/loading_a_parti.html">Loading
    a partial CUI and making its toolbars visible through .NET</a> and <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2007/05/creating_a_part.html">Creating

  body: 'Hi Kean,


    for getting a selection I use the following statements:


    Form1.Hide()

    selectionOpts.SingleOnly = True

    selectionRes = ed.GetSelection(selectionOpts)

    Form1.Show()


    This perfectly works for the modal dialog, ACAD shows the pickbox selector and
    with one click the object is selected.

    In the modeless dialog however only an ordinary mouse-pointer is shown and it
    needs 2 mouseclicks to select the object. What is needed to do the selection with
    one click ?


    Thanks Mark'

  body: 'Hi Mark,


    Actually the best - and safest - way to handle this is via the command-throat.
    Modeless interactions with a document can be tricky, so we generally recommend
    firing commands to the command-line (via SenStringToExecute() - see <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2008/09/more-quiet-comm.html">this
    recent post</a> for a reasonable approach for this).


    As you want to reshow the dialog, you will probably want to check a flag in your
    application from your command and then re-display the dialog, if needed.


    People often find sending commands "ugly", but in many situations it''s actually
    the proper way to do things. This is one of those situations.


    Cheers,

  body: 'Hi Kean,


    ObjectARX-developers made our life quite hard...

    Switching from GetSelection to SendStringToExecute changes the program logic because
    of its asynchronous nature. So I capture the PromptedforSelection event.

    This works, but I always have to terminate the Select-prompt with a ^C.

    I did not find a way to select just a single object (as it worked with selectionOpts.SingleOnly
    = True). Do you have an idea ? Here is my string:

    doc.SendStringToExecute("_select ", activate:=True, wrapUpInactiveDoc:=False,
    echoCommand:=True)


    Thanks

  body: 'Hi Kean,


    A little off topic here, but similar in nature: I was wondering if there a means
    of customising the Dynamic Input mechanism? What I mean is, currently we are constrained
    to use the various GetXXX() (in EditorInput namespace) methods for obtaining input
    from the user. Fine, this works well, but is there a way to obtain information
    about the input AS it is occuring?


    What I am trying to do is create a sort of ''intellisense'' mechanism when the
    user is typing in information at the Dyna-input prompt on screen, and based on
    what they enter, say a ''.'' then pop-up another little user interface at the
    point on screen where they are typing.


    Is this possible?


    Thanks

    John.'

    You may indeed also need information provided by a PointMonitor, to know where
    the cursor is, etc.

    This would be a perfect one for the ADN support team to handle (I''m not using

    I do not recommend using Hide() and Show() function withing a modal dialog to
    start interacting with AutoCAD. Quite often it causes nasty flickering. Maybe
    you could mention the proper way of doing this by using the Editor.StartUserInteraction
    class.
