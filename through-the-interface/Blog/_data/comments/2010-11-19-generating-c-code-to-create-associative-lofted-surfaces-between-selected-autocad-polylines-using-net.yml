    I have read posts that you suggested. Now I have some problems.

    1. I want to create a mesh, not a surface or polygon meshes.

    2. I use AutoCAD 2010 and Visul Studio 2010, I can''t find LoftProfile in the
    namespace.

    3 SubDMesh Methods can create tabsurf, yes or no, how?

    This question flow me many days. Really want to solve it. Can you give a new simple
    example? Thanks.
