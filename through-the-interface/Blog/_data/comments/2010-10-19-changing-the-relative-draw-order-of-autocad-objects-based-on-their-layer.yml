  body: It would be nice if you could change the order by drag&drop instead of having
    to hit the up & down buttons a bunch of times. Is the draw order saved when the
    dwg is closed & reopened?

  body: hi kean,i found a problem in AutoCAD2008 plot library just like plotengine
    class etc,but i'm not sure about it.When i using BeginGenerateGraphics on a dwg
    file without any modify,it has a fast plot to file,but when the dwg was modified(for
    example double click the blockrefrence in the doc and edit),the scence has changed
    that it become very slow to plot.when using the ANTS performace tools,the result
    show that it's five times slower than that the scene with no changed dwg.Thanks
    for your attention.

  body: Thanks for the great tool Kean and Terry. I like Barry Ralphs' idea posted
    above. The repeated clicking to bring to the top or bottom is tedious with a large
    layer list. Also, I was wondering if it would be possible to save a layer order
    which could be loaded into other drawings? That could be very handy given that
    most companies have an established list of layers.

    You can get the project from the link at the bottom of the post. If you load it

    build a DLL that can be NETLOADed into AutoCAD.

  body: 'You''re close: I tend to open the .sln rather than the .vbproj, but either
    should work. You may find the project needs some references to be found: if you
    right-click on the project in the Solution Explorer (on the right, usually) and
    select Properties, you can add a Reference Path via the References tab (this is
    in VS 2008, which I am using) to your AutoCAD installation (e.g. "c:\Program Files\Autodesk\AutoCAD
    2011").


    Then hopefully you can Build Solution via the Build menu and you''ll find a DLL
    you can NETLOAD in the bin\Debug or bin\Release sub-folder.


    Let me know how you get on,

    It works great so long as there is nothing on the selected layers outside of "modelspace".  But
    it fails every time it runs into a layer that is in use in model & paper.


    Is there some way of getting around this? (IE: have it work in both spaces)'

    geometry, but we should also be able to support paperspace.


    I would start by filtering the geometry selection to do two passes to each later:
    one for modelspace and one (perhaps even more) for paperspace. You''d then open
    and use the DrawOrder Table for the appropriate space.


    If this goes further as a Plugin of the Month, I''ll certainly make sure this
    gets addressed.

    Simply changing ...

    tvs(1) = New TypedValue(DxfCode.LayoutName, "Model")


    ... appears to fix the problem (for modelspace only).  Being a long time mapping
    user I can''t see any justification for expanding it to layouts.

    In the *highly unlikely* case someone needs to change the draworder in paper space,
    they can do it manually.

    It may be that NETLOAD isn''t telling you that the module hasn''t loaded properly:
    make sure you have the right DLL version for your AutoCAD MEP version.


    The best would be to install it from the Exchange Store (I''m pretty sure it''s
    up there, probably provided by DotSoft).

    This sounds like a product usage question (which isn''t really my area of expertise).
