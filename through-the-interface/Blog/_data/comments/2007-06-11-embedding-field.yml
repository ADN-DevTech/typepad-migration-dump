    your Format (i.e. PaperSize) and Title properties for the document were correct,

    thank you again for your code. At the moment I''m trying to insert a block with
    attributes into a drawing. With AttributeReference.HasFields I know if the attributereference
    has fields or not. It would be great if you could show us how to get the field-text
    of an attributereference.

    I don''t know whether it''s the automatic translation, but I have trouble understanding
    what you need. I think it might be related to custom fields (in which case, see
    the TextFileField ObjectARX SDK sample).

    The item regarding addition of numeric attributes from different blocks is an
    interesting one - I''ll try to take a look at that when we come to cover field/table

    Great blog - thank you!

    My question is - how do i read back the field code with c# (from an attribute
    e.g.)?


    I am linking room-label blocks with polylines, using fields inside an attribute
    to display the polyline''s area property.


    Later I want to find out programatically, which polyline a certain block is linked
    to by evaluating the field in the attribute (extracting the objectId).

    In 2012, the Table object now has more features.  I am able to say (in VB):

    Dim cell As Cell = dTable.Cells.Item(rowNum, 0)

    cell.Value = strField

    trans.commit

    When I do the cell gets a field, and the table shows the field value I entered,
    but it doesn''t generate the value properly until I simply edit the field, and
    close it (no changes).  Strange eh?  Do you know how to best use the table object
    in the 2012 Acad?  Is it still the same as you posted above or completely different?


    Thanks,
