  body: 'Thanks, Rick. I hadn''t heard this term before.


    The term does seem linked to the specific tool you''ve mentioned (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiled_printing">Wikipedia
    refers to it</a>, but doesn''t have a page dedicated to the term, interestingly).
    So I''m going to stick with my existing (and somewhat less shocking ;-) terminology.

  body: 'Oh, and by the way - it''s not actually the same thing. Rasterbation seems
    to be the process of testing colour & brightness for an area of the input, and
    creating an appropriately sized monochrome pixel on the output, with a view to
    creating a much larger image.


    We do test colour but don''t convert to black & white nor do we adjust the output
    pixel size. If anything this process is about creating a simpler, less complicated
    image.

    For general support requests, please post to the appropriate <a href="http://discussion.autodesk.com">online
    discussion group</a> (if you''re not an <a href="http://adn.autodesk.com">ADN</a>
    member).


    To use the standard AutoCAD raster object you would need an external raster image
    file, although you could implement your own with enough time and effort.
