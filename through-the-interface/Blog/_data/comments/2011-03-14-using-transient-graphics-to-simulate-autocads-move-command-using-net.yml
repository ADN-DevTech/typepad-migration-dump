  body: 'Hi Kean, you sure crank out new posts fast, good stuff. Couple q''s: 1) I
    am on win 7 64 bit, and this comment window I am typing in is displaying as cut
    off on one side or the other.

    It shifts so I can see the word I am typing, but cuts off the right or left of
    the sentences.  It also cuts off the published comment, I''ll email you a pic.

    real question now - I use this technique of pre-drawing things before the user
    picks where to put them, and much of the time they have extra info compared to
    the final entities. Would you use jig for things that are not, and will not be
    drawn? I am not as familiar with jig as I am with transient graphics, so the answer
    might be obvious to someone who is. thx'

  body: 'Hi James,


    The comments entry & preview are a bit flakey, to say the least.


    I don''t know whether it''s down to TypePad or the templates used for this blog,
    but I generally consider it a minor annoyance (as long as the comments show up
    properly it doesn''t really matter).


    I generally author my comments in Notepad, anyway, to make sure they don''t disappear
    if the post fails (which does happen, from time to time).


    Anyway...


    Jigs are great (they take care of a lot of the complexity around displaying/undisplaying
    temp graphics), especially if you have an entity you want to display. You could
    probably use a combination of Overrules and Jigs to avoid direct use of the transient
    graphics API, but it''s a question of choice.


    Regards,


    Kean'

  body: 'Hi Kean,

    thanks for bringing up transient graphics. Norman''s blog certainly deserves a
    wide readership.


    Since it''s customary to display transient entities with an empty IntegerCollection
    as last parameter, they often do not display satisfactorily if TILEMODE = 0. Any
    chance to demonstrate how the IntegerCollection can be populated to restrict the
    drawing of transients to either the current viewport (e.g. if CVPORT = 1) or else
    to the active viewports without the paperspace viewport?'

  body: 'Hi Thorsten,


    I''d be happy to, although I don''t know the answer, myself (and it''ll take me
    time to research it).


    It sounds as though you''ve already tackled this... feel like signing up for a
    guest post? :-)
