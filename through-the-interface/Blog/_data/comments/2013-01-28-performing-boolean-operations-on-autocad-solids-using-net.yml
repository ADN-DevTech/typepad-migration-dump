    I was aware of the Boolean operations, but it''s little jewels like the AllButFirst
    method that help a great deal to better understand Linq.  Thanks, and keep up
    the good work!'

    I''m glad you found it useful.


    LINQ has got some really helpful features, many of which come from the world of
    Functional Programming (I tend to work backwards from what I know I can do in
    F# ;-).

    I really like your articles about AutoCAD 3D operations, and this is a great one.
    Thanks.


    I am wondering 1) if there is any way to retrieve complex 3D objects from Autodesk
    database using ObjectARx? 2)Could those Boolean operations that used to generate
    complex 3D objects be retrieved as well?'

    My pleasure.


    You can access all kinds of objects using ObjectARX. And for AcDb3dSolids you
    can use the BRep API to query their topology.


    The issue you may face is likely to be around the history information that''s
    available: even if recorded this isn''t something you''re likely to be able to
    get at, unfortunately. That includes this kind of Boolean operation.


    So while you can access an object''s current topology, you won''t be able to access
    or manipulate its history.
