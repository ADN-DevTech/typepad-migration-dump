    Is there an option to get an error code in addition to the error message produced
    by vl-catch-all-error-message. The main problem is that this error message is
    produced in the (local) language of the installed AutoCAD-product. Therefore it
    is NOT useable for identifying the type of error in professional programs to be
    distributed internationally.


    Plus a list of possible errors returned by vl-catch-all-apply would be nice too.
    I could not find anything myself. Unless it is the same list as in vba?'

    I don''t know of such an option, although I''d check the ERRNO sysvar in case
    that contains anything useful.


    I''m not sure what you mean by a "list of possible errors returned by vl-catch-all-apply",
    unless you mean the list of errors vl-catch-all-apply can catch... It''s most
    common usage (in my experience) is with COM, so is of most value when used with
    COM exceptions. It''s not clear to me that an exhaustive list is possible, given
    than these are coming from COM. Unless I''ve misunderstood your point.

    Since there is no option to get an error code the part about the list does not
    really matter anymore. (And ERRNO is not really compatible with vl-catch-all-apply).
    But just to clearify it, I meant a "list of errors vl-catch-all-apply can catch".
    For the VBA-Environment such a list exists (see i.e. http://support.microsoft.com/kb/142138/en-us/).
    The list would not have to be complete, the most common errors would be nice,
    but as I said, without codes in AutoLISP it would be useless again.


    Kind regards, Stephan
