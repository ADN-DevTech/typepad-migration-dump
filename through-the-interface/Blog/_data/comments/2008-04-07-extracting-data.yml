    I don''t think that''s currently possible: it doesn''t appear to pick up properties
    exposed through COM, although I haven''t tried with a managed wrapper.


    Please submit your question via the ADN site for someone to look into.

  body: 'Hi Kean.

    I just popped this into VB and took out the hard coded filenames.  I ran it on
    a drawing created by my automation program, and the only thing I don''t see extracted
    is Xdata.

    I''d be interested in figuring out if that could be done. (in the data extraction
    tool, I know how to do it otherwise)


    Actually I also saw something else a little strange... I have a particular type
    of block which is inserted with varying X-scales so that the length of the block
    changes.  The Attribute references show up under the data for the block, but the
    specific data for the attribute references themselves does not show up next in
    the list, like it did for other uniformly scaled blocks.  At the moment I don''t
    think this concerns me, I just found it interesting.'

  body: 'Hi David,


    I hadn''t tried this with Xdata, but it doesn''t fully surprise me that this isn''t
    currently supported.


    Xdata content tends to be stored fairly generically - the group codes don''t have
    standardised, human-readable labels - so some logic would be needed to map these
    to XML elements. Not to say it''s very hard to do, but it doesn''t surprise me
    that it hasn''t been done.


    I hadn''t come across non-uniform blocks acting differently. If you''re an ADN
    member it would be great if you could submit it there with a reproducible case.


    Thanks,

    So it would seem (I have SDKs back to 2010 on this system and don''t see it there).
    I suggest pinging the ADN team, to see if they''re posted somewhere they can point
    you at (whether or not you''re an ADN member - these should be made publicly available).


    Just drop me an email if you have trouble getting a response.
