    Thanks for clarifying - my answer probably covers both scenarios, in any case.


    Unfortunately this level of integration is not something that''s provided automatically.
    There''s no built-in connection between Palettese and CUI - it would have to be
    replumbed from our side or (and I''m not sure this is even possible) layered from
    your side, by connecting the settings for your PaletteSet with the data stored
    in the CUI file.


    This is really a question for the ADN team, as it''s outside my personal experience.

    I cannot get the fullsubentitypath to fill as anything other than null in any
    of the three programs in this series that call for it.  I have had this problem
    in other code as well and cannot figure it out.  I am running Autocad 2008, .Net
    2005, WinXP on a x64 machine.


    Thanks.'

    Does it occur on any other machines? I haven''t come across this problem, myself,
    but may be missing steps to reproduce it.


    My best suggestion, at this stage, is to reinstall AutoCAD, to see if that helps.

    I do read your blog regularly and are very useful. This sample code works for
    most the entity types but not hatch entity. Can you give me hints so that it can
    work with hatch entities.

    How is it not working? Does it not select the entity, or does it show incorrect
    object information? This is an old post - and has some UI - so it''ll take me
    time to investigate.

    Are you sure this isn''t a hatch selection issue? They can be quite tricky to
    select.


    Try comparing the process with selection from a standard command (such as SELECT).

    This issue is only with AC2007

    and not with AC2010/2011.


    I have not test with AC2008/2009

    Then I''m afraid there''s not much I can do to help. Clearly something changed
    in terms of hatch selection (probably a change to allow hatches to be selected
    without being strictly on their graphics), and that''s a core change I can''t
    easily help retrofit.

    Sorry for the delayed response - this comment was flagged as spam and I only just
    realised.


    A few new property-related functions were introduced in AutoCAD 2012. Perhaps
    these help? I think they were along the lines of (getproperty) or (setproperty)
    rather than (getpropertynames), but it''s worth looking into.
