    brought it home, and hung it on your refrigerator with magnets.

    My feeble attempts don''t come anywhere close to the gems my 5 year-old cranks

    the Underlay Layer.  This allows you to put a view of your 3D model on a canvas
    layer and sketch blow it and above it.

    I''ll be taking another look at this once I''ve upgraded one of my machines to
    Windows 7, hopefully next week (I have an external LCD touch screen waiting for
    me to start covering it in finger-print grime :-).


    Cheers,
