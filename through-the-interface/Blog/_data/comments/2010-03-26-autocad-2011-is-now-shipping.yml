  body: Exciting! I am really looking forward to seeing the point cloud sample. Will
    it be in .NET?

  body: 'Hi Kean!

    Do you know what "enhancements" were made for the Visual LISP IDE (point 8)? That
    surprised me to read that after so many years of no changes.

    Sorry to disappoint you: the list is what people voted on during the API Wishlist
    Survey. The items in bold are the ones we addressed in the 2011 release.

  body: 'Ok, thank you. The words "that we delivered in this release" threw me off.
    These words actually only refer to the wishlist as a whole, of which again only
    a few points could be addressed. Sorry for my misunderstanding and thanks for
    clearing it up.

    Regards, Stephan'

  body: Don't feel bad. I also didn't realize they only delievered on the items with
    bold-faced type (someone posted the list on the Autodesk discussion groups, *without*
    the bold-face type, or at least, I didn't see it in my newsreader).

  body: 'Hi Jürgen,


    I haven''t done anything much with this, myself, but you should be able to find
    a sample in the DevDays material on the ADN site (or in the DevDays Online material
    on the API webcast archive - found under <a href="http://autodesk.com/apitraining,">http://autodesk.com/apitraining,</a>
    for any non-ADN members interested in this).

  body: I hate to sound picky, but why bother sorting a priority of wishlist survey
    responses if Autodesk isn't going to pay any attention to the priority?  Why not
    just bulletize them instead of numbering them?

  body: 'Autodesk does pay attention to the relative position on the list: the list
    is used to influence the long-term (as well as short-term) priorities for the
    product - some items are easier to address than others, as I''m sure you realise.


    Working many of these priorities into an already-busy annual development cycle
    would be next to impossible. Inevitably some of the items are looked at with a
    longer-term perspective, and (unfortunately) others are not aligned with the current
    direction of the product and are unlikely to be addressed.
