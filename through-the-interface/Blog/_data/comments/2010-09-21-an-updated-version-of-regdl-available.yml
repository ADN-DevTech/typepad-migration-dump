  body: "I had a problem with your RegDL application when using it with an installer\
    \ as described earlier. \nThe problem is when the .dll you want to register uses\
    \ a type from another .dll.\nWhen RegDL is in \".\\install\" it can only find\
    \ types in that directory. To fix it I changed some code as follow:\n\n<code>\n\
    // As each dependent assembly is resolved, we need to make\n// sure it is loaded\
    \ via Reflection-Only, not a full Load\n      AppDomain.CurrentDomain.ReflectionOnlyAssemblyResolve\
    \ +=\n        delegate(object sender, ResolveEventArgs rea)\n            {\n \
    \               string simpleName = new AssemblyName(rea.Name).Name;\n       \
    \         string dllFile= Path.Combine(Path.GetDirectoryName(asmName), simpleName\
    \ + \".dll\");\n                if (File.Exists(dllFile))\n                {\n\
    \                    return Assembly.ReflectionOnlyLoadFrom(dllFile);\n      \
    \          }\n                return Assembly.ReflectionOnlyLoad(rea.Name);\n\
    \            };\n</code>\n\nThanks for your articles they help me a lot!"

  body: This is very useful, but there is one thing but - RegDL does not overwrite
    the value in the registry, if there already is.

  body: 'If that''s the behaviour you desire, it should be trivial to implement (and
    the full source code is provided for you to extend as you see fit).
