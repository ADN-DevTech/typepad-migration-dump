    Hi Kean;


    I just have the curiosity, how it is possible to run most of the extensions fas,
    vlx, arx, etc... using, for example a 3rd party software like toolkit max for
    the autocad LT versions (I don''t use LT by the way).


    About C#, I started writing some code with that language, end up using it for
    hobby or for code I simple do not care if someone end up viewing it... as can
    be seen with the reflector, and if it is an obfuscator, then it must be a way
    to break that too.


    For, some of my serious work (still as a hobby) I prefer now C++/ARX/MFC, having
    using it for the last two years now, still to much to learn...


    Great site you have, cheers!'

    Thanks for your comment.


    I''m not aware of how that''s done, or whether the various file formats would
    need to be reverse-engineered for it to happen (that''s not the case for ARX modules,
    for instance, which are executable module connecting to a set of DLLs).

  body: 'Hi Kean,


    Great article. Many years ago at the architectural engineering firm where I used
    to work I made the decision to do all of my programming in LISP instead of ADS
    or later ARX. One of the reasons for this is because I was trying to create a
    network of "non-IT" developers within the company to help with the creation of
    our menu system. It worked well - too well. Apparently the sharing concept extended
    outside of our company. I currenty work with someone who learned to write AutoLISP
    code by going through our well documented code - at another engineering firm.


    When our code wasn''t so well documented or not as logical as it should have been,
    that is when we considered encrypting it - so no one would see how bad it was.


    I also appreciated the reference to the job titles memo from "K. R. Throop" -
    I made a business card the first time I saw this memo with the title "Intergalactic
    Exalted Cosmic Hyper Programmer."


    Later...

  body: 'Hi Kean, great article!


    Exactly due all facts that you guys told here I still prefer to write my applications
    core with unmanaged C++.


    If your core are protected the chance someone stole your code and put it running
    is minimum. In other hand, inside your unmanaged C++ modules you won''t have direct
    access to the huge API .NET provides.


    Maybe Microsoft or other company comes on a near future with an option to encrypt
    MSIL code and only the MSIL compiler will be able do decrypt the code.


    The real fact is that the chances of an application code to be reverse-engineered
    is proportional to the value and the number of potential users it has on the marked.


    I always say that if there are 20 engineers protecting a software or a code, using
    part time of their job, there are a thousand of crackers with much more energy
    and time available to brake it. It''s really a matter of interest, crackers and
    time.


    Further, the encryption is a protection that only increases exponentialy the probability
    of a crack but still it''s a matter of time and a capable machine to break the
    code. If you get some application which cracks passwords it will break simple
    in just a few seconds and stronge-named passwords will take more time to happen.


    Sometimes the code is self-encrypted because some developers does not like to
    comment the code and/or use strange names for functions and variables. I personally
    hate this code because it is really a shot in your own foot.


    Maybe the best solution is to mix and spread your application in several modules
    using a good set of languages (managed, unmanaged, scripts, etc.). This way your
    code will be much more difficult to understand and to be reverse-engineered.


    Any other ideas on that?

    Cheers!'

  body: 'Personally, I would not make technology decision based on the ability to
    protect one''s IP (keeping in mind the context of this discussion).  Thus, I would
    not choose ObjectARX/unmanaged C++ over .NET/C# and the managed APIs just because
    MSIL is easier to disassemble than x86 assembly.


    First, you have to really consider the actual value of your IP: I’ve seen (and
    probably written! :-) ) a lot of source code that at the end of the day really
    isn’t all that interesting.  There is a tremendous productivity gain from .NET
    which allows developers to focus on delivering  functionality quickly rather than
    chasing down memory leaks.


    Second, Microsoft is aware of the problem and is presumably taking steps to improve
    the situation (in addition to the options already available).  For example, it
    is rumored that future versions of the CLR will require that all assemblies be
    strongly signed--regardless of them being GAC’d.


    Finally, there are often legal options such as copyrights, trade-secrets, license
    agreements, etc.  With enough effort, someone can reverse engineer an unmanaged
    C++ ARX; but just because they’ve done that, they still may not have the right
    to use the IP embedded in the ARX.'

    Kelvin does indeed exist although he runs around in real life with another name.
    He even wrote some of the early AutoCAD manuals. You even worked and lived near
    him but may have not realized this.
