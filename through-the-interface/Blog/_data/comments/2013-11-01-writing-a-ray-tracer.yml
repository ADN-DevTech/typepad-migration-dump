    When will the Kean mind meld be invented??

    On same subject, I would think you have access to world class 3d gurus given Adesk''s
    ownership of Maya and max. I wish I had that as I would ask them how they can
    simplify a civil engineering type surface with emphasis on keeping the sharper
    edges (walls, curbs...) I bet they have a few ideas.'

  body: 'Yes - C++ was required. Even Microsoft recommends C++ for DirectX work (as
    far as I recall), even though there are 3rd party bindings to C# (such as SharpDX).


    There are incredibly talented 3D gurus in the company - most of whom I don''t
    know - who I''m sure could solve all manner of problems. But they often have tough
    problems they''re working through in their own domains, of course, even if more
    of them are focused on cross-product problems than before.
