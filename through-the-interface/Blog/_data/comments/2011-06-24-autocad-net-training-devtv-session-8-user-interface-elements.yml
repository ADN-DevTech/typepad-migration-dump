  body: This may be a pie-in-the-sky request, but is there any way to get transcriptions
    of the videos?  It's faster to read, and if their posted in a web format, it'd
    probably help people get better results in the searches.

  body: 'I''m looking into this. We do have some rough transcripts (which were used
    to determine what we presented, rather than being a verbatim record of what was
    said), but I do think they''ll be helpful. I''m looking into what it would take
    to tidy them up and post them.
