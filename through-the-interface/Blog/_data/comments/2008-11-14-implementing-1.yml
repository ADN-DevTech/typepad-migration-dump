    I have been using your example to create and display my own Task Dialogs and been
    delighted with the results. However, I have noticed with migrating the code to
    2010 that the AutoCAD icon in the top LH corner of the does not display. This
    is not important, just wondered if you might have any ideas?

    I have to admit I haven''t looked. It could well be a change in style between
    2009 and 2010. Have you checked any standard task dialogs, to see what they look
    like?


    Cheers,

    Although 2009 is OK, the "core" 2010 Task Dialogs don''t appear to show the AutoCAD
    icon either. They must have changed (or forgotten to do) something in this release.


    Cheers, Steve.'

    At least it''s consistent. :-)


    My bet is that this is by design: it''d be very surprising if a detail like this
    was changed by mistake.

    This all works great for me, with one exception. When I call a TaskDialog from
    a windows form, it seems to open modeless. Outside of a windows form, it works
    fine (modal).


    Do you have any idea how I can fix this?


    Thanks!
