  body: Congratulations, Kean... I almost missed your note at the end. As soon as
    I started reading, my thoughts went straight to that moment during your AU class
    and I was tempted to scroll down and paste my resume into the "comments" section.
    Oh well...

    Timbot/Jose - I passed your request on to the AutoCAD WS Product Manager, and
    apparently this is something that''s increasingly being requested. We''ll for
    sure continue to evaluate relevant platforms for WS based on customer requests
    and market share. Here''s hoping that ends up being good news for you, sooner
    or later.

    I think they could put you on any team and you would have a good impact.

    I would consider all Autodesk programs as emerging though, so how do they decide
    which ones you improve :)
