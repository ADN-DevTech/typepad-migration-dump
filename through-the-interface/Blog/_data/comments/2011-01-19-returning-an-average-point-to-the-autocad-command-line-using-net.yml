  body: 'Hi Kean,

    concerning numeric representation in different locales: System.Format uses the
    default implementation of ToString() as long as there are no format strings provided,
    so you should be save. At least in .de it works as expected...


    Thanks'

  body: 'Yes, assuming that command-line input uses full-stops/periods for decimal
    separation on locales that otherwise use commas, which appears to be the case.


    In any case, as we''re using commas to separate the coordinates, we have to use
    full-stops as the decimal separator... (so yes, I''m agreeing with you :-).

    One side benefit: it would probably also make for a more predictable result if
    AVG wasn''t called transparently.


    Thanks!

    The simplest would be to download the AveragePoint Plugin of the Month from Autodesk
    Labs. It was posted in February 2011:

    Be aware you may need to unblock the ZIP after downloading it:
