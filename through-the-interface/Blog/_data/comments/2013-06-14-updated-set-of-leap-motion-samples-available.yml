  body: 'Hi Fran,


    You would need to build the project using either Visual Studio or Visual C# Express
    (loading the .SLN and then resolving a few project references, pointing them to
    the location AutoCAD has been installed to) and then NETLOAD the resulting .DLL
    into AutoCAD.


    Regards,
