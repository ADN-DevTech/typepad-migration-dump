  body: 'Dear Kean


    I´m working with .Net and Autocad. I´m trying to run a rutine that change the
    color of an object (line), I know how

    to do this with one color, but i want to change the line in various colors, for
    example from red to green to yellow in intervals of time, the rutine must be run
    while i´m working

    in the draw ( for example while i´m doing zoom ) but i need the line back to the
    original color when i do a click (event)

    with the mouse. I can´t find the solution, can you help me ?!'

  body: 'Dear Claudio,


    It''s certainly possible to set a timer and cycle through colours on a set of
    objects - the issue is doing so during a realtime pan/zoom and also accessing
    the database in a safe way irrespective of what is happening in the editor.


    Frankly I''d look at leveraging the in-built selection highlighting mechanism
    inside AutoCAD, which would be much safer.

    thanks for your info, but I am still stuck. I am using acad2006 - I have a folder
    full of small A3 drgs, each with a title block. I want to update the attributes
    of the Revision from A to B and insert "issued for construction" and the date
    etc. How can I do this using Global Attribute Editing techniques for Multiple
    drawings?

    Cheers

  body: 'Is it possible to get a version of this code where the user is prompted to
    create a selection set of nested objects first, and then being propted for the
    new colour of the objects?


    i.e is it possible to get the code for changing colour working the same way as
    it does for changing layer, as detailed here: <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2010/06/changing-the-layer-of-an-entity-in-an-autocad-block-using-net.html">http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2010/06/changing-the-layer-of-an-entity-in-an-autocad-block-using-net.html</a>
    ?


    This would allow the user to pick and choose the objects affected, rather than
    making a blanket change to all nested objects.

  body: 'Hi Kean,

    Thanks for the detailed implementation. I used this code for coloring selected
    block-reference. It worked fine for me except one problem. In my architectural
    drawing I have 2 sofas(block references) that are referring the same block(sofa).
    I want to color one of them. But, if I colorize one sofa, the other one also gets
    that color. Is there any way to fix this?


    Regards,

    Mayuresh'

  body: 'Hi Mayuresh,


    The typical way would be to have the geometry you want coloured differently to
    be done so "by block" or "by layer". At least that''s my understanding.
