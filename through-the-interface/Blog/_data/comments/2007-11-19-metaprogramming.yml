    The point of using a string is to handle the case where we store, retrieve and
    evaluate code. Of course you can use the quoted version - which allows some level
    of dynamic behaviour - but that doesn''t address the storage requirement.

    Regarding "The point of using a string is to handle the case where we store, retrieve
    and evaluate code".


    That''s a precise description of what we do every time we save lisp code in a
    .LSP file, that we then load and execute :)


    The point to my comment is that LISP code, in its native form, takes the form
    of a LISP list, rather than a series of strings.


    Hence, lisp code that dynamically generates other LISP code, does so by constructing
    a list via the usual means of doing that. And that list can then be passed to
    (eval) to be executed as code.


    In case anyone isn''t aware of it, the (vl-prin1-to-string) function is a cool
    and easy way to convert a LISP expression (whether it be data or a list that represents
    LISP code) into a string which can  be persisted and retrieved in that form.'

    This appears to be specific to LDT (and possibly Map 3D), as it refers to ade.dcl.
    I don''t have any experience with these products - you should try submitting the
    question via <a href="http://adn,autodesk.com">the ADN website</a> (if you''re
    an Autodesk Developer Network member) or posting to the <a href="http://discussion.autodesk.com/forum.jspa?forumID=81">AutoCAD
