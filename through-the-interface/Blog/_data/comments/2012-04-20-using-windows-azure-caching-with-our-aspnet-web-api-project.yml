  body: hm, it seems you could also save space if you could reduce the precision of
    your floats (to -let's say- 4 digits after the point)... don't know if it's possible

  body: 'Also true: for now I''ve just left the default precision, but this is a change
    that can be made after the fact (as it''s not API-breaking).


    Assuming I can work out how to do it. :-)


    Thanks!

  body: I like the series! One question. How does the cost compare to the cost of
    hosting yourself? I know nothing about server cost, but can see a need to consume
    XML from a web service. This may make a diff in my project.

  body: 'Good question... a lot of companies are seeing the benefit of essentially
    outsourcing infrastructure procurement and management to cloud providers (even
    Autodesk, who probably has enough scale with our own cloud offerings to run a
    data-center or two, prefers to focus on our core competency of software development
    rather than manage all those boxes).


    At a smaller level - meaning for the smaller, independent software vendor - I''d
    say it makes even more sense. When you consider that your costs scale linearly
    with your customer-base, and that you don''t have to buy servers up-front that
    are almost inevitably going to be either under- or over-utilised, it''s a great
    option.


    At least that''s what we''re hearing from several ADN partners. Whether the same
    logic holds true for corporate developers who maintain their own internal development
    teams remains to be seen (I have less insight into the issues around procurement
    etc. for such organisations).
