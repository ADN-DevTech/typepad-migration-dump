  body: 'Hi Kean,

    I am not sure what to think of Autodesk''s cloud talk yet, as I have not seen
    how acad would work, being run as a service remotely. We have seen remote desktop
    type cloud setups, but this SAAS has not been revealed yet. How is customization
    handled with SAAS acad? Until that is talked about, your other points all sound
    like apologies for what is to come. Don''t sell me on ideas, sell me on the implementation.
    I''m sure you feel the same about anything you would buy or eat. All of us in
    industry have basically been burnt badly by the yearly releases of acad, so our
    trust is at an all time low. Not showing us how adesk wouild implement SAAS for
    acad is exactly what we would expect of somethig we will not like. We need the
    chance to try SAAS for about a year before we would consider it as a critical
    platform. I wonder if Adesk realizes how protective cad managers are of their
    reputations and careers.'

  body: 'Hi James,


    I''ll simply refer you to <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2012/03/moving-to-the-cloud.html#comment-6a00d83452464869e2016764998756970b">the
    answer I gave you</a> last time you commented on this topic (in response to <a
    href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2012/03/moving-to-the-cloud.html">this
    post</a>).


    This should not (and cannot) be a discussion on how Autodesk is taking our products
    to the cloud. This is all about showing how software developers in general (and
    developers working with Autodesk technology specifically) can derive benefit from
    moving core algorithms somewhere they can be used more widely/flexibly/valuably.


    This is far from being "an apology for what''s to come": it''s advice that members
    of our development community are embracing wholeheartedly (if you happen to be
    coming to AU you''ll get a much better feel for what other ADN members are already
    doing with the cloud).

    LISP code to the Cloud is going to be.

    In seriousness, it''s going to be some time before that''s possible. The Core
    Console makes it more likely, depending on what the LISP code does... although
    there are definitely still technical & legal hurdles to get over before this becomes
    feasible.


    As you''re no doubt aware (but I''ll state it for readers who may not be), this
    particular class focuses on extracting core algorithms that are independent of
    AutoCAD, and clearly assumes they be written in a programming language that can
    execute independently of AutoCAD.

    subject of SAAS and customization. You are one of the few that could.

  body: '"legal hurdles"? Oh how i''m interested in this side of the continuing push
    "to the cloud".


    I find your posting very interesting: however the problem for me, and many others,
    is a business situation: the contractual envelope within which we must work.  This
    must be sound and at the moment it far from being so!


    It is intriguing how you can go to all the trouble you have, intend to and yet
    the legal foundations for that which you are promising/proposing are little more
    than "jelly about to be placed in the sun".'

    Please don''t make the mistake that others have in looking at this material as
    talking about Autodesk moving its products to the cloud: it looks at the general
    trend and at approaches that software companies *in general* can use to move software
    functionality to the cloud.


    Please continue to raise your business-related concerns via the relevant channels:
    this is not the right forum for that, however.

    That must bug you a little, CEO marketing ahead of substance. Has that ever gone
    well for Autodesk?'

  body: 'The reasons people are expressing those concerns here are:


    1. You''re an Autodesk person promoting the Cloud, so you''re kind of painting
    a target on yourself here.


    2. You''re doing so in a forum that allows interactive discussion.


    3. This isn''t that common; Scott Sheppard is the only other example I can think
    of where it''s not done as a one-off.


    4. You''re clearly a reasonable, honest person who is prepared to listen to the
    other side of an argument and respond accordingly.


    Autodesk really, really needs to engage its Cloud-dubious user base in an interactive
    way, because all I see at the moment is very confused and unconvincing PR nonsense
    and a lot of I-hope-they-didn''t-notice avoidance of all those awkward questions.


    I understand that handling customer frustrations is absolutely not your area,
    but whenever you promote Cloud you can expect discussion. Thanks for what you
    feel able to contribute.'

    I can understand why my cloud-related blog posts might end up being a focal point
    for these concerns, but I do consider them "off topic" when expressed here (I''m
    really not in a position to discuss the future of using Autodesk software in the
    cloud - for now, at least).


    Incidentally, I''m increasingly convinced (especially just coming back from AU)
    that many members of my target audience (which primarily means software developers)
    *are* convinced of the benefits the cloud brings and want to invest accordingly.
    They largely (and IMO not naively) believe that most of the concerns held around
    the use of the cloud will get addressed over time - one way or another - and in
    the meantime want to find a way to get familiar with the technology in a controlled
    way.


    Which is ultimately the intention behind these blog posts, of course.


    Cheers,


    Kean
