  body: '"the ultimate answer is that it’s unlike anything we have today – in AutoCAD
    or even elsewhere, I suspect".


    Geeze. It''s been sitting right there in front of us for about 20 years. It''s
    called LISP.


    (setq a 0)


    (setq b ''(+ (eval a) 1))


    (eval b) -> 1


    (setq a 2)


    (eval b) -> 3


    ; Proof:


    Command: (setq a ''(+ (eval b) 1))

    (+ (EVAL B) 1)


    Command: (setq b ''(+ (eval a) 2))

    (+ (EVAL A) 2)


    Command: (eval b)

    Hard error occurred ***

    internal stack limit reached (simulated)


    Of course this is obtuse only because the AutoLISP flavor of LISP doesn''t provide
    the means to make it any less obtuse, as other complete and mature implementations
    of the language do.'

    But the point is the abstraction provided by the framework and how it creates
    and manages relationships between variables.


    And of course there''s a lot more to DesignScript - this was just introducing
    a few bits of background and some fundamental concepts.


    Take it for a spin and see what you think then, Tony.

  body: 'Kean,

    More languages is fine, but don''t you feel like the whole .net conversion never
    finished off because VSTA never made it into aoutocad? I recall Jerry Winters
    saying at AU how we were close to that, being so careful to not reveal the exact
    release, as if Autodesk was keeping some secret. I don''t mind if they decide
    to do this or that, and know predictions like that are not real until they happen,
    but is Autodesk still on the fence about VSTA? THe advantage being not having
    to restart acad at every debug run. Not that this is a new question, but this
    topic raises it again.'

    I''m really not at liberty to discuss any future product plans via a public blog.
    If you come along to DevDays (or look for information on the ADN site - or ask
    the ADN team via their direct support channel, for that matter) then you''ll be
    able to find out more.

    \ \n\nYou can define functions dynamically at runtime in C++ 11.0 and in C# (or\
    \ for that matter, any CLR language), and you can also manipulate CLR functions\
    \ if they are defined as lambda expressions using Linq Expressions, but those\
    \ objects are <b>language-independent CLR constructs</b>, as opposed to language\
    \ constructs comprised solely of elements of the programming language used to\
    \ initially define them.\n\nAlso, allow me to correct my previous comment. \n\
    The LISP equivalent of your DesignScript example is actually much simpler than\
    \ what I showed:\n\n<pre>\n(setq a 0) -> 0\n(setq b '(+ a 1)) -> (+ A 1)\n(eval\
    \ b) -> 1\n(setq a 1) -> 1\n(eval b) -> 2\n</pre>\n\nBefore going further, I think\
    \ it might be helpful to kindly ask you to clarify your previous comments, regarding\
    \ what precisely it is about DesignScript that is 'new', 'unprecendented', or\
    \ to the best of your knowledge, does not currently exist in other programming\
    \ languages."

  body: 'C# and C++ were used to implement the DesignScript runtime, which is the
    main reason I mentioned them. If you''d chosen to write and execute that code
    yourself, you''d have "solved" the associativity problem. A ridiculous example,
    of course, but one that was intended to highlight that there comes a point where
    it makes sense to leave this work to the framework.


    I do need to spend some more time writing about DesignScript - I''ll see what
    I can put together this week. I''m up to my eyeballs in preparation for my AU
    classes, but I''ll see what I can put together.

  body: "Hi Kean,\n\n - Thanks for this, and as usual, you're pretty much spot on.\
    \ Ultimately the reason we chose to build another language, as you say, is because\
    \ we can give users a substantially better user experience - that starts off easier\
    \ and goes further - than would be possible if we used an existing language.\n\
    \nYou can already see some parts of this, like the associative language or the\
    \ ability to mix and match different coding styles (associative and imperative)\
    \ within DesignScript itself. We're already seeing people do things with this\
    \ that would be really hard in other languages.\n\nAnd you're absolutely right\
    \ that like most languages we had a bunch of inspirations from many other sources\
    \ including amongst others Scala, C#, Python, Rhino Grasshopper, Processing -\
    \ even Javascript, as well as less frequently known sources like EPur, ThingLab\
    \ and Field/CLA.\n\nLooking forwards to seeing what people do with DesignScript,\
    \ and btw Kean, add something glaring incorrect next time so I have an excuse\
    \ for commenting ;-)\n\nThanks, Luke"

  body: 'But the "associative nature" are necessary not always. At the some situations
    it can be not the same, what necessary by programmer. Has the DesignScript syntax
    for both cases?

    I think, "associative nature" can give to programmers some errors, which are difficult
    for catching.


    Necessary to write simple examples on DesignScript and on other languages (C++/C#/Lisp)
    for comparison and expediency of using DesignScript instead of other languages
    (at the different situations). Without such substantiations the DesignScript will
    a nice toy only, without which it is easily possible to live.'

    No offence taken! It''s just that there are places this will be a useful tool,
    but places where it won''t: I''ll work with the DesignScript team to get some
    helpful samples posted that make this distinction more clear.

    \ and there are some things that are a much easier fit for 'imperative' code like\
    \ C#.\n\nAs I'm sure you'll see in later blog posts, one of the features of DesignScript\
    \ is that you can change the way execution is run for a block with an annotation.\n\
    \nFor example the below is already supported:\n\n[Imperative]\n{\n   a = 10;\n\
    \   b = 2;\n   c = a + b; \n   Print (c); //prints '12'\n   a = 100;\n   Print(c);\
    \  //Still prints '12'\n}\n\nOn your second point - I agree we need more samples\
    \ explaining the different situations that we might use the different features\
    \ in. We're working on it :) Thanks for the suggestion.\n-----"
