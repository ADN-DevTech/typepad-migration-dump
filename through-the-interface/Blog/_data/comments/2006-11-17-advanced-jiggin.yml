  body: "Your code snippet works for me, but I am having trouble converting this to\
    \ C++.  I admit to not being all that familiar with C#, but I'm hoping you can\
    \ help me.  Where are the variables PromptStatus and Entity defined?  \n\nIt seems\
    \ like the ObjectARX 2007 C++ interface for AcEdJig is half baked compared to\
    \ the c# interface.  Unfortunate, because I can't use anything but C++ for my\
    \ project.\n\nRight now I'm frustrated because it seems like AcquirePoint returns\
    \ nothing but kNormal or kKW1 through kKW9.  I never get kNull, kCancel or anything\
    \ else.  Neither does there seem to be an equivalent to PromptStatus.  Here is\
    \ my set user controls function call:\nsetUserInputControls((UserInputControls)\n\
    \ (AcEdJig::kAccept3dCoordinates\n  | AcEdJig::kNoNegativeResponseAccepted\n \
    \ | AcEdJig::kNullResponseAccepted\n  | AcEdJig::kInitialBlankTerminatesInput\n\
    \  | AcEdJig::kAnyBlankTerminatesInput ));\n\nI appreciate any answers to the\
    \ above questions as well as general help with the acquirePoint function in ObjectArx\
    \ 2007."

  body: 'There is no direct equivalent for PromptStatus in ObjectARX (C++) - this
    was created to wrap a number of concepts (the ErrorStatus and the value returned,
    for instance). Enity is AcDbEntity in the C++ API.


    I''d suggest looking at the EllipseJig C++ sample (under samples\database\elipsjig_dg
    in the ObjectARX SDK).


    Otherwise, please post your questions to <a href="http://discussion.autodesk.com/forum.jspa?forumID=34">the
    ObjectARX Discussion Group</a> or via <a href="http://adn.autodesk.com">the ADN

    a separate database-resident polyline that you update as you acquire values (and
    just jig the latest segment, for example).


    I haven''t tried to do this, myself: I''d suggest contacting the ADN team, if
    you''re a member.

    en VBA la commande :AngleFromXAxis:

    \ Matt, except that you have gotten me going trying to learn F#.  I cannot for\
    \ the life of me figure out how to code a jig in F#, or even how to handle an\
    \ \"Entity\", which has no available constructor.  Converting this code to F#\
    \ is as far beyond my abilities at this point as is the peak of Mount Everest.\n\
    \nCould you see your way clear to posting a sample of a jig in F#?\n\nThank you,\
    \ Kean, and thanks for all the great stuff you've given us already.\n\n   -- Geoff"
