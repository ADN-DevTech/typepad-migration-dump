  body: 'Kean, Autodesk has no idea how important drone topo is to the civil engineering
    world. I can tell, because the infraworks product is marketed a certain way, and
    that is because good existing ground data is rarely available.

    10m grid topo from usgs is not good enough. The FAA will technically not let us
    fly drones in California, and I am not sure if things like recap are accurate
    enough for ground info (6" accuracy vertically...). You show us the software end,
    and we will deal with the FAA. I think My son needs to go fly his new UAV for
    fun .... We will find ways to fly our site. We need the software processing of
    the photos figured out though. Is this what recap can do?'

  body: I fogot to mention, solve the drone topo issue, and you make Infraworks way
    more valuable without changing it at all. Better things to display will sell more
    seats of the display mechanism.

  body: 'I''d hope that ReCap Photo has the precision that''s needed (but as it''s
    not my area of specialty I can''t really say).


    I can say that I agree this is an extremely interesting and important area, though
    (and I know that there are lots of other people at Autodesk who do, too).

    might control the site a bit. Its a gold mine for whoever does a diyable solution.
