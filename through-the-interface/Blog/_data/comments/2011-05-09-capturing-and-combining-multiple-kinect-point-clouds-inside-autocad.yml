  body: "Hi,Kean\n   I'm glad to see you are using the video sensor to implement into\
    \ autocad. It's really funny!\nTwo month ago, I bought a sparkfun IMU sensor (<a\
    \ href=\"http://www.sparkfun.com/products/9623).\">http://www.sparkfun.com/products/9623).</a>\
    \ I want to let it control the autocad entity like this video (<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuHRCnpcsDQ).\"\
    >http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuHRCnpcsDQ).</a> But i can’t find the method\
    \ to transform the IMU output data (pitch/roll/yaw) into autocad rotation function.\
    \ Pls help."

    3D mice exist and do just this, so there must be a way.

    clous alot, can you write about geometric alignment of 3d models into point cloud?

  body: Oh,When you change the sequence of rotation,you will get the different result.Should
    be any calculation of the angle!!

    I''ll be seeing what can be done, in that regard. Interesting work, though!

  body: 'Hi RK,


    I haven''t actually done much work on this, in terms of establishing accuracy
    or an approach for accurately aligning point clouds with 3D models.


    My work with Kinect and Photosynth has mostly been exploratory in nature, and
    it remains to be seen whether working with point clouds from either source will
    prove feasible (as they''re not really designed with design capture in mind).


    Photo Scene Editor is another story: getting accurate design information out of
    it is front & center from a product design perspective. I suggest playing with
    that and providing feedback via Autodesk Labs.

  body: 'Hi zaker,


    Yes, it should work with AutoCAD 2011. You should get the latest Microsoft Kinect
    SDK - this version works with that:

    This is probably the closest thing to a tutorial post (which I don''t have time
    to create for you, I''m afraid):

    These may also help, assuming you''re an AutoCAD beginner:
