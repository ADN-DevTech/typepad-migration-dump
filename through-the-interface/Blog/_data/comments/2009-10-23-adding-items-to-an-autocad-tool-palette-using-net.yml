  body: 'Hi Kean


    Thanks for such a knowledgeable post :). Its very informative. I was looking for
    something like this...


    However, I need some additional information regarding the Palettes.


    For instance I have created a Palette file of my own, like

    My_Palette_222A1245-4A65-4E62-9D97-B9F2F851C2CD.atc.


    How can I load and add its entry in Catalog?

    I will be using its Command in my .lsp script which is used to load my custom
    application interface in AutoCAD.


    Any quick help would really be appreciated.

    Thanks in advance.


    Best regards

    Farrukh'

    Can you point out why we are using customization using .NET or what are the benefits
    of create Tool Palette in .NET, however it can be done in AutoCAD UI easily.?'

  body: 'If you mean "why customize via code rather than just have someone use the
    UI"? then that''s really a large topic (and yet very simple: there are lots and
    lots of reasons). And I suspect you''re visiting the wrong blog. :-)


    If you mean "why use code when you can deploy and programmatically load a .CUIX
    file", then I''d say that it''s a choice. In this case I''m including C# code
    in the project anyway, so adding a few lines to create TP entries is my preference.
    If I were doing something different I might make a different choice, as deploying
    a .CUIX file with the Autoloader (for instance) really simplifies UI creation
    for apps on the Exchange Store.

    Yes, my mine was first one. I just want to know that what are the benefits, reasons
    and why we create Tools Palettes using programming rather than simply use TP from
    menu(in AutoCAD).

    If I am visiting wrong blog so can u please suggest me from where I can get right
    answer?'

    Application developers often want to automate tasks that they don''t want end-users
    to have to do repeatedly (or even once on installation). What may seem complex
    for an app developer to create in code is often considered a reasonable trade-off,
    as it gets used by many, many users (and automating even a one-off task can reduce
    the support calls they have to field).


    This is true of many areas of application development, not just creating TP items.


    I hope this helps clarify,

    I''m very curious why this request is being repeated (and on a 4 year old post).
    Did you see the comment on my blog''s main page or come through from a forum post,
    perhaps?


    Or maybe this is a new form of spam that will somehow impact SEO? Getting this
    somewhat strange request repeated so soon is confusing, to say the least.

    I have a question..Is there a  possibilty to share a toolpalette developed in
    .net on a network drive?

    and Can admin set the standard property of the tools inside that shared toolpalette
    and user should not have the access to perform any modifications of that tool
    palette.


    Thanks in advance..!!!!

    Loading DLLs from network drives tends to be a bit tricky.


    This may help, although I can''t promise you won''t hit strange issues with this
    approach:


    <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2011/07/loading-blocked-and-network-hosted-assemblies-with-net-4.html">http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2011/07/loading-blocked-and-network-hosted-assemblies-with-net-4.html</a>


    I don''t know whether you can flag the tool palettes as read-only, but then if
    you''re regenerating them using code, there shouldn''t be a problem.

    Kean
