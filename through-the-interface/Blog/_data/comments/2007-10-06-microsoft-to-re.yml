    Is Autodesk planning to do the same with AutoCAD.NET API? :)

  body: 'Hi Fernando,


    The managed API in AutoCAD is really a thin layer on top of ObjectARX, so publishing
    its source wouldn''t be of great benefit to developers, IMO. And in any case,
    we don''t obfuscate the managed API assemblies, so I''m pretty sure you can get
    as much value out of the assemblies with Reflector as you would from the source
    (see <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2007/01/reflecting_on_a.html">this
    previous post</a>).


    Cheers,


    Kean
