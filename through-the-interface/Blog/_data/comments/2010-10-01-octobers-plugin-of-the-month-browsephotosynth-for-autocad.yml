  body: 'Hi, I follow with deep admiration for the past several years and this is
    the first time

    that I write. Waiting for this plugin for a few months and finally tried it. Great
    work as always but I have a problem. When I import point clouds, is inserted along
    a line as if the points were projected into a plane. the command line of AutoCAD
    (2011) I get the following message:


    Command: Enter path to PCG: Enter path to LAS:

    I also tried with other files but the problem remains.


    I''m Italian and I apologize for my English translated by google however I wanted
    to thank you for the excellent work you are doing.'

    Thank you for the kind words.


    Some synths do come out a little peculiar - especially those made from photos
    taken from a single position.


    Have you tried it with other synths, for comparison?

  body: 'Hello Kean,

    I tried with other synth including your head;).

    Unfortunately the result is always the same. All points of the cloud are arranged
    as if the y and z coordinates have value zero.

    I tried your plugin on different workstations but the result is always the same
    and I don''t understand where I''m wrong.


    Thank you for your time,

    Alberto'

    I can confirm that my head should indeed not be one-dimensional. :-)


    Could you let me know the specific product versions you''re testing with (including
    language version), as well as the OS (and whether it''s 32- or 64-bit)?


    Also if you could <a href="mailto:kean.walmsley@autodesk.com">email me</a> a sample
    PCG file then I''ll take a closer look.


    I may end up needing to provide a custom build that doesn''t clean up the intermediate
    TXT and LAS files, which will hopefully shed some more light on the problem.

    It turns out it''s to do with the Italian locale, which - like French and German
    - has comma as the default decimal point. As the points are saved to a comma-delimited
    file, this is a problem.


    Changing the decimal separator to "." at the OS level is a possible workaround,
    but I''ll try to create a version of the app that forces its locale to English.


    Thanks, Alberto!

    Could you provide a bit more info:


    * Which Windows version are you using (including whether 32- or 64-bit)?

    * What happens during install, if anything?

    * What fails to happen, according to your expectations?


    I''m using BROWSEPS on Vista 32-bit AutoCAD 2011, in case (but it''s not the only
    OS it''ll work on, by any means).

    Hmm. I wonder if something stopped the installer from writing to the Registry.


    Can you use the NETLOAD command inside AutoCAD and browse to the Program Files
    installation (on my system it''s in "C:\Program Files\Autodesk\BrowsePhotosynth
    for AutoCAD") and then select the "ADNPlugin-BrowsePhotosynth.dll" file?


    If that doesn''t work then there''s something else in play, and I''ll need to
    do some more digging.

  body: Kean, the "netload" command worked great.  I then did the "browseps" command
    and I got the Photosynth to work.  The point cloud came in as well.  Thanks for
    that tip!  I'm not quite sure why it didn't work as originally installed.

  body: 'Hi John,


    Thanks - I see the problem.


    Photosynth point clouds are now being stored somewhere other than under a URL
    with the GUID included. The tool detects when a point cloud file has been loaded,
    and uses the URL to get the GUID and query some properties about the project (such
    as the files it needs to access).


    This is going to take a little work to fix, unfortunately...
