    Did You see this?: <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/archives/2008,">http://www.raspberrypi.org/archives/2008,</a>
    may be you can use turbo mode to speed up a little the process.

    I did, thanks - I''ve already overclocked my other Pi (the one running Raspbian,
    as the raspi-config script makes it easier to do so).


    I haven''t yet decided whether I''ll take the time to enable Turbo on my Arch
    Linux ARM device.

  body: "Hi Kean,\n\nI tried to create a 64bit autocad .net app which tries to communicate\
    \ with a 32 bit application in a separate process. So I am using WCF to manage\
    \ the communication between apps. The service host is the .net dll loaded inside\
    \ autocad and the client is the other .net app(32bit). It seems that the client\
    \ can not communicate with the server.\n \nCan anyone guide me to figure out how\
    \ WCF can be used inside autocad .net app? or may be any example could be useful.\n\
    \ \nThanks,\nAli"

    This question pretty much defines the term "off topic". :-)


    Please submit your question via ADN or on the AutoCAD .NET Discussion Group.

  body: 'Hi Kean,


    I''m following your blog and have just tried to get the source for the daemon
    and build it but am having no luck. I have done the wget fine and unzipped but
    when I run the g++ build I get this:


    [pi@alarmpi facerecog]$ gcc ''pkg-config opencv --cflags --libs'' FaceRecDaemon.cpp
    -o facerecd

    gcc: error: pkg-config opencv --cflags --libs: No such file or directory


    I have run everything successfully before this point so know that I have all the
    respective packages.


    Any hints?


    Thank you, Adam'

    g++ as you suggested but had the exact same error message.

    First thing to try: make sure you''re using backwards apostrophes, not normal
    ones.


    I hope this helps,

    What happens if you run "mkdir faces" first?
