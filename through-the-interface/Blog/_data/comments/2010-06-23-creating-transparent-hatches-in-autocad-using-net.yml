    As explained by email, I don''t have time to provide support in this way. Please
    post your questions to <a href="http://discussion.autodesk.com/forums/forum.jspa?forumID=152">the
    AutoCAD .NET Discussion Group</a>.


    Jigs are message loops that AutoCAD uses to gather input (usually related to geometry)
    from the user.

  body: "hi Kean!! thanks a lot!! this has been really helpful!! im new to autocad\
    \ plugins, and what im trying to do is to create hatches in a map according to\
    \ some data in an excel file. that's already working, but for some reasons not\
    \ every section of the map gets hatched, its weird, i think its something to do\
    \ with the boundary created for the hatches next to that area... is there a way\
    \ that i could create the boundary for the hatch and then delete the boundary??\
    \  \nand im having problems with the hatch being on top, and i haven't been able\
    \ to move'em to the bottom. i tried following this other post of you( <a href=\"\
    http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/draw_order/\">http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/draw_order/</a>\
    \ ) and i used dot.movetobottom() but it's not working\n\nany help you could give\
    \ me will be very appreciated!! =)\nthanks!"

    to TraceBoundary(), the order of the returned DbObjectCollection objects can be
    used instead.


    According to the 2011 ObjectARX docs:

    "...the first entry is the outermost boundary, and the succeeding entries represent
    the islands found."


    Based on my tests in Acad 2012 I found this to be INCORRECT. It seems to be the
    other way around, i.e. the last entry is the outermost boundary.


    This post and tip simplified hatching with islands considerably :-)
