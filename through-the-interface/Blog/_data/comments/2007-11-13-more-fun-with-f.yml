    Have you looked at AutoLISP for .NET or rather LISP for .NET?

  body: 'Jimmy,


    I can see that getting a mainstream LISP implementation for .NET would be one
    way to further evolve the AutoLISP platform.


    The major issues I see are around portability - Visual LISP in particular added
    a great deal of new functionality that would be very hard to map across - and
    the fact that significant additions/changes would be needed in AutoCAD''s managed
    API to enable this.


    The approach of continuing support for AutoLISP inside AutoCAD and enabling interop
    with .NET languages is probably the more pragmatic path.
