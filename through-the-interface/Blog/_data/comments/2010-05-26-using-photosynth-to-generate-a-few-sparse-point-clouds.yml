    How did you take the pictures? Did you use some special camera with a tripod?


    This subject is very cool, I like how it is evolving!


    Cheers,

    Fernando.'

    The pictures were taken with a completely standard digital SLR (a Canon EOS REBEL
    T1i, according to the metadata on the photos). Each image was around 5-6 MB in
    size.


    No tripod: Brian stood on chairs and tables to get different angles (he admittedly
    seems to have a pretty steady hand and good balance :-).


    Cheers,

    Some good work as always - I saw the following article over at Make Magazine that
    I thought you might be interested in:

  body: 'Hello Sarhat,


    Sorry, no I don''t. You''d need to calibrate with a known distance, but then you
    need to remember that Photosynth is not really intended to be accurate (it''s
    main purpose is as a consumer-oriented tool to coordinate photos).


    If accuracy is important to you, you may want to take a look at "123D Catch" -
    this is really intended for accurate photogrammetry-based reality capture.
