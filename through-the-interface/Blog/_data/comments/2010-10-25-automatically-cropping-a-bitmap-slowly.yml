  body: Very nice Kean! It makes the clipboard more easy to navigate through multiple
    clips now (if not using the "rename" feature). And on my machine at least, I really
    had to look for the delay that you mentioned. It's not a factor for me. Maybe
    Autodesk will consider making this part of vanilla cad for their next release.
    Kudos!!!

    You may actually be working with the optimised version (1.0.6), which I have only
    sent to you by email, for now (as you submitted the request for this enhancement).
    I''ll be posting that one in the next installment (Tuesday or Wednesday).


    If you happen to be using 1.0.5 from this post, then all the better - 1.0.6 works
    much more quickly.


    Either way I''m very happy it''s working well for you! :-)

  body: The ReadMe.txt file that I have lists 1.0.5 as the last version. I grabbed
    the one from this post when my rss feed came through. 1.0.6 must be really fast
    then. I look forward to it. Thanks a million!

    This updated version (1.0.5) works fine, just one remark. After you have removed
    all clipboard entries, the last displayed preview remains visible.'

    Aha, of course... will fix that in the posted 1.0.6 version.


    Thanks!

    I love the new enhancements! I''m running 1.0.5 and can see the delay you mention
    but that''s not a deal breaker for me. I''m looking forward to 1.0.6. Great work
    and thanks for the post.
