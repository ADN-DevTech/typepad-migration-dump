    One thing I would love is to use 3d printing to replicate the working action of
    old inventions. It would be really cool to print out some old telescope and plug
    in some lenses to make it work. Or maybe an old sextant with all the little gradation
    marks that take forever to do by hand.'

    Not sure how feasible it is - I''m not a 3D printing expert...
