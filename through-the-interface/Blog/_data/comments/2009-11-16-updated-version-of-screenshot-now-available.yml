  body: "\"Our “Plugin of the Month” applications target lower versions of the .NET\
    \ Framework (we want to avoid forcing people to use the latest version of the\
    \ framework and want the applications to run – where possible – at least as far\
    \ back as AutoCAD 2007), and so their default level of trust will make running\
    \ from a network share a problem.\"\n\nActually, that's irrelevant for AutoCAD-hosted\
    \ plugins, regardless of the targeted framework version.  \n\nIf you carefully\
    \ read the blog entry you cited, you'll notice that the security changes for assemblies\
    \ located on the local intranet introduced in .NET 3.5 SP1, do not apply to assemblies\
    \ that are loaded by managed CLR hosts (which AutoCAD is)."

  body: 'I didn''t pick through the detail in the linked blog post closely enough
    to spot that (quite frankly reading about .NET security makes my eyes cross),
    although I did notice in my tests that targeting the latest framework version
    didn''t change application behaviour, at all.


    In any case, the recommendation of placing DLLs to NETLOAD under the AutoCAD executable
    folder stands.

  body: "I experienced the problem with the Save dialog, and your solution did not\
    \ work.  The longer I set the delay option, the longer the dialog stayed on screen,\
    \ always ending up in the image.\n\nSo I just moved the prompt for the filename\
    \ to after the image has been captured and processed, near the end of the SaveScreenPortion\
    \ Function, where the decision point is for Clipboard or File.  Works great, no\
    \ dialog in the image, and no need for the delay option. \n-----"
