  body: Very good point, platforms not just products. I have always told people AutoCad
    is a graphical operating system, not just a place to hand draft on the computer.  I
    am trying to convince the C3D guys that they should initiate a schema for Civil
    objects, not just make custom arx objects that only acad can deal with. What I
    am getting at is they should establish a data platform before anyone else does,
    then sell the best object creator/viewer/editor based on that schema. The Civi
    industry cannot chase custom objects that change every year.  Its like if apple
    were to create an mp3 standard so it could sell ipods. You make the standard (correctly,
    talking to industry people) and sales will come.

  body: I think every call in the API labeled "For internal use only." and the whole
    "Autodesk.AutoCAD.Internal" Namespace shows that Autodesk "cheats"( as the rant
    calls it) and doesn't 'eat it's own dogfood'. I would love to see this changing
    - and also a point cloud API while you're at it ;-)

  body: 'My API of choice, for many sound reasons, is Visual LISP.  As Autodesk has
    done nothing but the absolute minimum maintenance (and sometimes less) with it
    in over a decade, I''d have to say that no, Autodesk doesn''t meet my platform
    needs.
