  body: 'Hi Kean,


    I want to hilight an entity with a specified color and lineweight. Currently I
    am using ent.Hilight() method which is the autocad standard with dashed line style
    only. Is it possible to do so with transient graphics? If yes, please explain
    how?


    Thanks

    Chandan'

    If you clone the entity you want to highlight and set its lineweight/color, I
    would hope these would be respected when displayed by the Transient Graphics system
    (although I haven''t tried it myself).

    Wont you get an exception in this line if vp is null?

    if (vp != null && vp.Number == 1)

    I''m pretty sure that the second clause isn''t evaluated if the first fails. Try
    setting vp to null just before the check to see what happens (and please do let
    me know if it fails inelegantly).


    Cheers,

    It''s not exactly what''s clear by "drawings in modelspace", but in any case I
    generally don''t provide support in this way.


    Please post your question - with a bit more detail - to the ADN team or to the
    AutoCAD .NET Discussion Group.


    Best regards,

    (Sorry if I do not use the best words or phrases to express, I do not speak very
    good English)



    Ok, here are some pictures to better explain the problem:


    The first "AutoCAD_BOMBA1" is the dialog box where we enter information required
    to make the drawings.


    The second "AutoCAD_BOMBA2" shows the 3 "drawings" (objects) that are made according
    to the information provided.


    The third "AutoCAD_BOMBA3" shows the three viewports.



    Now, I would like to show in each viewport one modelspace drawings. Then, adjust
    the scales and add text and dimensions outside the viewport.



    Thanks for your answer,

    Sorry - this comment got flagged as spam, so I only just noticed it.


    Hopefully you received a response to your forum post (I assume you posted the
    question there as you''ve linked to the images posted there).
