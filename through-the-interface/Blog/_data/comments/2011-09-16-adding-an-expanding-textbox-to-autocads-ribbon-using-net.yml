    I know, this might be a little bit Off-Topic, but does the Autocad Ribbon support
    Three-State Checkboxes, or will I have to switch to ComboBox/Spinbutton?


    Thanks in advance,

    Off the top of my head I can''t say for sure, but I believe it should be possible.
    Ultimately it''s possible to host custom WPF controls in the ribbon, so I have
    to believe there''s a way.


    You might try pinging Fenton Webb (or other members of the ADN team) via the AutoCAD
    DevBlog.
