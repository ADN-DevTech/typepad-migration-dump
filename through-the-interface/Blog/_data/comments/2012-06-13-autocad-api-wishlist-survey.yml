  body: 'Kean, the questions are rather simplistic don''t you think? They start by
    asking my preferred language, but actually I prefer lisp for some things, .net
    for others.

    I feel like they are setting things up to support anything that could happen.

    Reality is they need to ask about each api, not somehow divide and conquer to
    all our disadvantage.

    Who designed the surveys anyway?'

  body: 'James,


    I''ve been heavily involved in designing these surveys, over the years (although
    I didn''t design this one). It''s always a challenge to find a balance between
    getting actionable information and not asking pages and pages of questions (the
    number of responses you receive drops with each question you add).


    Something else to consider: some of the questions have deliberately not been changed
    to allow us to spot trends by comparing the results, year-on-year.


    Regards,
