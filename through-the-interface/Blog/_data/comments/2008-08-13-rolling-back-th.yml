  body: 'Hi Nick,


    Hmm - an interesting question.


    There''s a <a href="http://adn.autodesk.com/adn/servlet/devnote?siteID=4814862&id=5411957&linkID=4900509">DevNote
    on the ADN site</a> that should help, and I''ll see if I can turn it into a post
    for you (adding some logic to check for a specific block name).


    Here''s an excerpt from this document:


    "The EXPLODE command works on a Block reference by deepcloning the contents of
    the referenced block in kDcExplode context, and finally erasing the block reference
    itself. So, one solution to prevent explode is to exclude the block''s contents
    from deepClone operation and un-erase the block reference after the explode command
    ends."

    Very cool picture!

    When I open your blog today,I am very surprise to find that you have changed both
    the blog style and your picture,the new blog style is very nice.

    But I have question.Is the picture yourself?I fell it''s very different to the
    previous one.:-)'

    Yes, it''s me. Just two different views of the same person. :-)


    I''ll post something about the blog''s updated look later today.


    Thanks for the feedback,

  body: "Hi Kean - In AutoCAD 2009, it seems the problem was addressed, because I\
    \ can no longer repro it, but can on earlier releases. In fact, your code as-is\
    \ should be all that's needed running on an earlier release.\n\nAs an aside, while\
    \ the code is useful as an example of reversing changes to objects for specific\
    \ commands, it would not prevent all possible ways that certain objects can be\
    \ modified (or in this case, moved). So for example, a LISP or VBA macro that\
    \ uses the ActiveX API to move objects will bypass a command reactor-based approach.\n\
    \nIn any case, another way to arrive at the same functionality is by using a selection\
    \ filter (the Editor.SelectionAdded event).\n\nIn the handler of that event, we\
    \ can remove whatever objects we want from the selection based on what command(s)\
    \ are running or various other criteria. \n\nI think I'd prefer that approach\
    \ for this specific example and ones like it, if for no other reason, it doesn't\
    \ confuse the user by allowing the objects be selected and dragged, and they will\
    \ instead behave as if they were on a locked layer."

  body: 'Tony: I thought of the same thing.  Such code is useful and interesting,
    but it is not completely robust.  That may be fine for some "in house, end user"
    type of utility; but other situations may require more than just looking for a
    specific AutoCAD command.'

  body: 'Hi Velan,


    I don''t see this: the reactor is added at the beginning of each command, and
    only really does something when MOVE is used.


    There is no command that completely removes the top-level reactor, but that would
    be very easy to add.


    If you have modified the code and it doesn''t work for you, please submit it via
    the ADN site or post it to the AutoCAD .NET Discussion Group. Someone there will
    be able to help you, I''m sure.
