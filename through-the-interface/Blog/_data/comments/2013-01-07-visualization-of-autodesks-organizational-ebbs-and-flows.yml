    This is really beautiful, it looks like an extraterrestrial form of life, or something
    :)


    Do you have any idea if this should be interpreted as a 3D visualization (kind
    of an old dandelion), or it''s strictly a 2D representation?


    Looks 3D to me, but I just want to make sure I''m not too imaginative :)


    Thanks in advance,


    Constantin'

    Good question - when I watched it I assumed it was overlapping 2D, but I suppose
    it''s possible it''s flattened 3D. :-)


    Posting a question via YouTube is probably the best way to get a definitive response.


    Cheers,

    Impressive indeed, especially when a company is acquired or during the re-org.


    Did you find your own point?


    Cheers'

    I did think about taking a screenshot and labeling an arbitrary node in the graph
    "I am here". But that would have been pure speculation - I don''t know enough
    about the data to even hazard a guess.


    I was in the same role in the ADN team during that entire period and I suspect
    that corner of the org would seem like a little island of relative peace and calm.
    ;-)


    Regards,

    It is a 2D visualization, but the overlapping transparent nodes and edges in the
    force-directed layout do give it a 3D sort of feel.


    Thanks,
