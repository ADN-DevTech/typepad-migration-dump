    Although now that you mention it, the above image probably looks a bit like a
    heart in cross section (although that''s not especially romantic ;-).

    yes, and if you look at the lower picture in your previous posting, it looks like
    a whale tail...


    Cheers,

  body: 'Hi Kean,


    another idea: what about using your drawings as a draft for some nice tattoos
    ?


    In general, I think that this could become a new trend among architecture students.
    Just use a 1/100 section view of your favourite building for inking it into your
    skin.

    Perhaps they can omit the tattooist by using an old pen plotter...

    Ouch.


    Cheers,

    Rudolf'

    I was talking with a colleague about converting an old pen plotter to take a blade
    for cutting cardboard, to avoid having to buy a laser cutter to use <a href="http://www.123dapp.com/make">123D
    Make</a>. Maybe if we somehow combined the blade with ink, we''re basically there?
    Hmm.


    I''ll post a call for test subjects (with very good medical insurance) once we''re
    ready to launch. :-)

    combining the blade with the pen plotter, you could create prototypes either in
    cheese, cake or tofu.


    What about creating a tofu Eiffel tower for Jeremy ?
