  body: 'Hi Kean,

    I''m looking at writing a piece of software that will export all entities in a
    DWG in XML or LandXML format and import XML data into a DWG. Some of the entities
    would have Xdata attached to them.


    Which programming language would you recommend and do you have any tips on writing
    XML data


    Best regards

    Ben'

  body: 'Hi Ben,


    Here are some ways you might create XML files:


    1. You can use standard ASCII output functions from your favourite programming
    language (this can be the simplest, but may end up taking more effort if you need
    to support different types of encoding).


    2. You can create a DOM (Document Object Model) object using the MSXML COM component,
    and populate that with elements and attributes, and ask it to save an XML file.


    3. You can use the <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.xml.xmlwriter.aspx">System.Xml.XmlWriter</a>
    class from .NET.


    I''ve personally used 1 & 2 in the past -at the time I was working with VB6 -
    but if I had your problem to solve today, I''d go with option 3.

    Please be aware of this statement from the above post:


    "I''ve edited the above text to delete my personal RealDWG license keys – you
    will need to license RealDWG to receive valid license keys of your own for this

    I suspect this is the reason for the problem, but let me know, if not.

  body: 'Fred,


    I''ve taken a look into this... I don''t think there''s an easier answer, other
    than to re-create the solids with history enabled.


    Your assumption that AutoCAD knows about the underlying geometry isn''t correct,
    I suspect: the SPHERE command - prior to history being added in 2007 - created
    a spherical ShapeManager 3dSolid. From that point on it''s a 3dSolid and AutoCAD
    doesn''t think of it as a sphere.


    This changed with 2007, of course, but 3dSolids created with older versions are
    not automatically understood as being of different shapes/types: I don''t believe
    there''s a way to determine a solid''s creation history after the fact, unfortunately.


    Sorry if this is bad news (I''ll let you know if I hear something back from my
    team that contradicts this information).
