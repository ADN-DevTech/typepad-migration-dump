  body: "Hi Kean,\n\nThanks for that sample. Creating AutoCAD entities is sometimes\
    \ a bit of a task in itself, however, creation is only one side of the coin. The\
    \ other, and usually more illusory is entity modification.\n\nI was wondering\
    \ if you could show how to MODIFY the created surface/solid.\n\nOne thing that\
    \ strikes me as odd is the actual call 'CreateSweptSurface/Solid', which returns\
    \ nothing, so therefore it seems to be a method which simply sets up the current\
    \ instance internally. \n\nIf you call the same method, with the same parameters,\
    \ over and over, what is happening inside? Is a new object/internal data being\
    \ recreated?\n\nI have used this technique to modify a swept entity (I have a\
    \ test app which creates a swept entity from a path and profile, then lets the\
    \ user change the shape of the path, a spline for instance, and then the swept\
    \ entity reflects that change).\n\nModification of entities is a bit abstract,\
    \ as there is little definite way of modifying them, via grips or via creation\
    \ methods etc.\n\nCheers\nJohn."

  body: 'Hi John,


    It''s not currently possible to programmatically edit a solid''s hostory: you
    can recreate their state, but not edit their history.


    That said - and as shown in <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2009/02/creating-an-editable-autocad-solid-using-net.html">this
    previous post</a> - it''s very easy to enable them for user-editing: just set
    the RecordHistory flag to true before calling CreateSweptSolid and - in this case
    - you''ll get additional grips to allow modification of the path and the profile
    used to create the solid).


    We know a solids history editing API is needed, and it''s certainly on our list
    to get to.


    CreateSweptSurface/Solid do just affect the internal state of the object upon
    which they''ve been called. If you call it again and again on the same object,
    that object''s state will indeed be recreated and replaced.


    Cheers,

  body: 'Hi Kean,


    When I set sob.Bank = false and  I sweep a 3dpolyline with a rectangle shape instead
    of a circle, the new 3dSolid gets tilted. I would like to keep the elevation of
    my 3dSolid the same of the 3dpolyline.


    Any suggestions? Thanks,


    Mat'
