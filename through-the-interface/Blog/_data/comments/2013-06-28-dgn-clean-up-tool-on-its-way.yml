    that portion from the post (or remove the whole post if necessary).  Thank you,
    and very sorry about that.

    While on the subject of linetypes, is there a way to reload an xref''s linetype
    definition to a sheet?

    So you attach an xref, then modify some linetype in the xref by maybe making the
    dashes shorter. You want to reload the xref and have the linetypes update, but
    they do not. It seems the sheet remembers the original linetype definition, and
    does not reload it since visretain is set to 1. I think that is bad behavior,
    as users expect things in drawing header table like blocks and layernames to update
    when the xref is reloaded. Is there a way to grab the linetype from an xref and
    update the definition in a sheet? It seems many people want this from DG posts.'

    so quickly unpublished the comment, but as your reply was connected to it the
    TypePad system left the name as it stood and declared the comment as having been
    removed by the moderator. Hence the comment from James, below.


    Anyway - now that I''m back online properly it''s all sorted.

  body: 'The linetypes used in an xref (if memory serves me well) get cloned (and
    prefixed with the xref name) when it gets attached to a drawing. It should absolutely
    be possible to propagate changes between the two variants of a linetype, if you
    decide which behaviour is appropriate to that situation.


    I''ll think about taking a look at this for a post (no promises, though).
