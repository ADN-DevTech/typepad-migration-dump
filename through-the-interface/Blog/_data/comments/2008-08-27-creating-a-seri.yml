  body: 'Hi Kean,


    I tried this with a region rotated in 3d space that doesn''t pass through the
    origin, and noticed that the polyline doesn''t properly align.


    Your code creates a plane through the origin, i.e.:

    Plane pl = new Plane(new Point3d(0,0,0), reg.Normal);


    I think it should pass through a point on the region, i.e.:

    Curve cv1 = cvs[0] as Curve;

    Plane pl = new Plane(cv1.StartPoint, reg.Normal);


    This appeared to fix things.


    Cheers,

    You mentioned the following:


    "To recurse when we find a Region in the results of the Explode() call".


    Is it possible to create nested regions? How would this be done? I tried using
    UNION, SUBTRACT and INTERSECT commands using regions, but these appear to create
    new regions rather than nest them.


    So when the expode method is called on a region, is it actually possible to get
    a region returned in the DBObjectCollection?

    I''m not sure exactly how and when complex regions are created, in all honesty.
    Apparently (and this is looking back at my post, as I don''t work with regions
    every day), it seems that exploding a region can lead to you having another region
    to explode. How exactly that level of complexity gets built into a region (perhaps
    from extracting a region from a complex solid to surface?), is a question I''m
    not really able to answer, unfortunately.

  body: "Hi Kean,\n\nRegions created from Ellipses are not handled by your code.\n\
    \nTry adding an ellipse and a rectangle which are overlapping. Create regions\
    \ for each of them. UNION the regions (=> looks fine; region apparently can handle\
    \ the ellipse). Execute your code with this region => Ellipse seems to be ignored;\
    \ instead of the 'Ellipse-Part' there's just a straight line segment added. \n\
    \nI'd be very interested if you have a solution for this...\n\nSilke"

  body: 'Hi Silke,


    As polylines don''t support elliptical arc segments we''d have to broaden the
    implementation to create ellipses (with appropriate start/end angles).


    In itself that shouldn''t be too hard, but is certainly a topic for another post.

  body: "Hi Silke,\n\nWell, it turned out to be simpler thna expected.\n\nAside from\
    \ cosmetic changes to make it clear the command & functions deal with more than\
    \ just Polylines, there's really only a one-line change - we simply have to check\

    \n  // Closed curves can go straight into the\n  // results collection, and aren't\
