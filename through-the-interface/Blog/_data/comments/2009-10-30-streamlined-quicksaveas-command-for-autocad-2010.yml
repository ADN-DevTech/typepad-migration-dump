    If you''re saving a document that''s open in the editor anyway, you could just
    use COM Interop and AcadDocument.SaveAs. I recall there being a few quirks in
    using Database.SaveAs in earlier releases. (Although I probably shouldn''t say
    that when I don''t recall exactly what those quirks are :-s).'

    the values inverted (or it''s another sysvar)?

    I'm wondering what we be your recommended method for our blocks which need to\

    \ event, or create the custom command for each block via the toolpalette \"CreateCommandTool\"\
    ? Or if otherwise, what's the event/interface/handler for Blocks being dragged\

  body: 'Ben,


    Yes, a little off topic (and probably one that''s better raised via the discussion
    groups - I generally don''t have time to provide support in this way).


    The Tool Palette mechanism is indeed probably the closest to what you want (there
    isn''t a direct way to get code executed as blocks are inserted).


    Someone in the forums should have some advice for you.
