    Can be these dialogs called from ObjectARX C++ API?'

  body: 'Hi Fernando,


    The following colour-related functions are in the ObjectARX SDK, in aced.h:


    acedSetColorDialog()

    acedSetColorDialogTrueColor()

    acedSetColorDialogTrueColorWithCallback()


    The linetype and lineweight dialogs are not officially exposed via ObjectARX,
    but they are exported off acad.exe as:


    acedLinetypeDialog()

    acedLineWeightDialog()


    If you''re skilled with function de-decorating/unmangling, then you should be
    able to work out how to call them from the dumpbin output. This isn''t supported,
    however.


    Oh, and you can certainly invoke the managed versions from C++, although I haven''t
    done so myself.


    Cheers,

  body: 'Hello Kean,


    These controls are great, but what I would really like, are Combobox versions
    of them as that is more appropriate on a form.  I know ActiveX versions are available,
    but, from my experience they are not overly reliable in a .NET environment.  Maybe
    you could show how to create Colour\Linetpye controls as Combos in .NET?



    Cheers


    Martin.'

  body: 'Hi Martin,


    As you''ve mentioned, combobox versions of the AutoCAD controls (layer, linetype,
    lineweight, layer, UCS) as well as additional ActiveX controls for other types
    of content (DWG thumbnail, hatch-pattern, slide) are available for ADN members
    from <a href="http://adn.autodesk.com/adn/servlet/item?siteID=4814862&id=9628824&linkID=4900509">here</a>.


    The effort to re-create these in .NET would be non-trivial: if you have any feedback
    on using them from a .NET environment, please let us know via the ADN site, and
    we''ll do our best to fix them.

  body: 'Excellent example, thank you.

    I am implementing these dialogs in a Layer Standards dialog (VB.NET) and have
    managed to pass a color to the color dialog and return user selected. (using color
    convertor)

    However, with the linetype dialog (as with your example) the string returned is
    in an user-unfriendly format. I am assuming that it is possible to look at the
    linetype table record to get a description or like, but there does not seem to
    be an easy way to accomplish this.'

    This question is not related to the above mentioned topic. I would like to know
    if it''s possible to view sld files as thumbnails in listview control using C#.
    If not, what is the other method? Hope you will help me out.

  body: From what I see the LineTypeDialog only functions as an existing linetype
    selector. The Load from a selection made to a *.lin file portion of the interface
    does not result in the selected linetype being loaded into the active file. Is
    there a way to make that work without having to take the returned linetype name
    and then rolling one's own load? If I had to do that then I might as well create
    a proper linetype selector interface.

    command) after the selection.


    You might find it harder than you think to implement your own linetype selector
    interface, but feel free to do so.
