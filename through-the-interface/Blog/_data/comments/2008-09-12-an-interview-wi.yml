  body: 'Hi Kean


    Very! interesting read. I am looking forward to reading the other "Parts".


    I do have a couple of suggestion though (feel free to ignore them if you think
    they offer no benefit / value):


    1. Please consider making the other "Parts" a little shorter in length.


    I realise that will result in more "Parts", but reading shorter "Parts" on screen
    is a lot easier and consumes less time spent reading per "Part".


    2. When last "Part" has been published, compile all "Parts" into a master document,
    then publish that as a page here on your blog.


    Take care, Mike'

  body: 'Hi Mike,


    I ended up making the decision to split the interview along broad themes - it
    just naturally fitted that way. The latter parts are somewhat smaller: around
    4,000 words each vs. 6,000+ in this initial post. I know that''s still sizeable,
    but that''s just how it is - breaking it further ruins the flow. Maybe you can
    copy and paste to a local document and read it offline at your leisure? :-)


    To your second point: I will probably create a separate category for this interview,
    in due course. For now it will be the only content under the "Autodesk" category,
    so you eventually find all the parts on its corresponding page.


    Regards,

  body: Great interview but I don't like Mr. Walkers comparison to Windows of the
    80's and early 90's to Windows of today. Since Windows 2000 Microsoft has significantly
    improved things like I/O, Memory Management, CPU Utilization. In fact, since NT
    Windows has become a superior platform for killer apps like AutoCAD and Photoshop.
    But to say that Windows today is a junk and Microsoft is changing the OS every
    six months, please! The last major release of Windows prior to Vista was in 2001,
    approximately 7 years. The API's haven't changed drastically requiring this overhaul
    of the AutoDesk application. In fact, I think AutoDesk has made mistakes over
    the past few years. I don't think anybody is interested in a new version of AutoCAD
    every year. I am aware of you releasing a new version of AutoCAD codenamed X,
    thats another $3,000 license or $600 upgrade license, thats significantly way
    more than it cost for an OS from Microsoft.

    Thanks for sharing your views: John shared his, and I reproduced them on my blog
    (without necessarily sharing them 100%).


    I''m happy to see a dialog on this topic.

    P.S. This isn''t really my area - and this probably isn''t the forum, either -
    but one reason we maintain <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2006/06/compatibility_o.html">a
    3-release DWG and application compatibility window</a> is so that customers don''t
    feel they have to upgrade every year. You may see that differently, of course.'

    about business. He is a smart guy and I got some ideas from him. Thanks for publishing
    such interview with a great and intelligent man. It is my pleasure to hear some
    comment from John Walker.  Keep on posting such useful information.
