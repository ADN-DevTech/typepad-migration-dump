  body: 'interesting prog, all SAAS.

    I tried a couple lessons, and realized I really did need such simple instruction
    on a new prog. Made me feel about 2 years old :)

    I did not care for the 3d orbiting by the arrows though, hope it has a better
    mechanism somewhere.

    Why would AutoDesk try to compete with sketchup though?

    Curious what this prog has that is special.'

    We have a number of tools in the consumer space (mostly using the 123D branding).
    Yes, SketchUp is used by lots of Makers, but I expect the hope (belief?) is that
    we can more closely tailor Tinkercad to the needs of that community (one it''s
    already doing a great job of serving).


    Everything you create in Tinkercad is 3D print-ready, as far as I can tell (although
    some geometry would clearly need support structure, just as with any other design
    tool targeting 3D printing).

    I would like to see something printed from Tinkercad on it.'
