  body: Awesome!  This is an extremely useful chunk of code.  Thank you Massimo and
    Kean for sharing.  I'll update you on any issues as I customize this for my particular
    needs.

  body: Thanks Massimo and Kean for the example code, it helped me a lot. I tried
    to override Civil3D Alignment but GetGripPoints(Entity entity, GripDataCollection
    grips, ...) - the only one function that works. When mouse hover on my GripPoint
    AutoCAD Civid 3D throws Fatal Error. Autodesk Civil 3D GripData and myGripData
    differ by one property - AutoDelete, which value's false for GripPoints that created
    inside base.GetGripPoints(...). This property is read-only and I cant change Its
    value from true which is default value if I create GripData. I guess that the
    check of this property may delete GripData object and it possible this is the
    reason a Fatal Error. Please help me solve this problem.

  body: 'Hi Sergey,


    I''m afraid I don''t know about this specific issue. I suggest posting some code
    to the Civil 3D Developer discussion group or to the ADN team.


    Best regards,

    the steps how can i create the curved polylines?Until now i only did GOO command
    and it says "Grip overruling turned on".Have i done something wrong?

  body: 'Try using the PLINE command to create a polyline with curved corners (make
    sure to use arc segments alternative with straight ones).


    Run GOO and then select the polyline: you should see the new grips.


    At least that''s my recollection of how this works.

  body: I created a polyline then i typed GOO still nothing.Maybe I'm not doing something
    right.What I'm trying to do is a polyline with curved angles I asked the question
    in StackOverflow too <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17966737/autocad-polyline-with-curved-angles">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17966737/autocad-polyline-with-curved-angles</a>
    .Does this code create what i want or did i get it wrong?

  body: 'The PLINE command allows you to create polylines with curved segments: just
    use the Arc keyword after each straight line segment to create the type of polyline
    this code works with.


    The code doesn''t create these segments for you, but once a polyline fitting the
    pattern is created, the grips it will show (after GOO had been called) will maintain
    the coherence of the polyline.

  body: 'I''m having trouble with my grips being drawn in the correct location. The
    error appears to take place in the "ViewportDraw" method. This EyeToWorldTransform
    returns values that make coordinates that should be in the 100s out around 40k


    <i>Matrix3d e2w = worldDraw.Viewport.EyeToWorldTransform;

    Point3d pt = this.GripPoint.TransformBy(e2w);</i>


    Thoughts? I''m using Civil 3D 2013, and the units are in feet.'

  body: 'My first thought would be to check whether it''s due to precision (i.e. the
    double type can only deal with certain tolerances when working with large coordinates).
    Does the same thing happen with geometry near the origin?

  body: The error actually gets worse when I make the polyline smaller/closer to the
    origin. The coordinates should be around 1 or 2, and the grips are drawn at coordinates
    around 100k.
