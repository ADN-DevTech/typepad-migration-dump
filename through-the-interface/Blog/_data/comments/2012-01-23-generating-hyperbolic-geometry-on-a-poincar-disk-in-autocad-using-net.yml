  body: "Hi Kean,\n\nI know you ask to don't ask, but I think you can save some operations\
    \ in the ComputeCircleParameters: pre multiplying ax*ax,bx*bx and ay*ay (may be\
    \ losing some precision a obtaining some performance), and grouping some others\
    \ intermediate values, also 1/2.0:= 0.5, so you don't need that division.\n \n\

  body: "The math is harrowing enough, even in the special case that the point lies\
    \ on the unit circle (e.g. distance to arc center is given by <i>cos dtheta +\
    \ sin dtheta * tan dtheta</u> (for more see <a href=\"http://mathworld.wolfram.com/PoincareHyperbolicDisk.html),\"\
    >http://mathworld.wolfram.com/PoincareHyperbolicDisk.html),</a> but still... \n\
    Did you both miss Math.Abs() for the radius, to avoid the duplicated formula?"

  body: "Thanks, both - I fully admit I spent more time formatting than examining\
    \ the mathematics (and ways to streamline it).\n\nThe remaining posts for this\
    \ week are already queued up (and I'm travelling), but I'll be sure to re-examine\
    \ when I'm back home.\n\nFurther suggestions welcome, by the way!\n\nKean  \n\
