  body: Is there any change to use Editor.SelectAll for a document that is not the
    currently active document (e.g. necessary if actions are taken during autosave
    of a document that is in the background) ?

  body: 'Editor.SelectAll() requires the document to be open and active in the editor,
    as far as I''m aware. You can gather a list of objects to work upon by iterating
    through the contents of a non-editor resident drawing, however.

  body: 'Hi Miguel,


    In future if you have support requests please submit them via <a href="http://adn.autodesk.com">ADN</a>,
    if you''re a member, or to <a href="http://discussion.autodesk.com/forums/forum.jspa?forumID=152">the
    AutoCAD .NET Discussion Group</a>, otherwise. I generally don''t have time to
    provide support unrelated to specific posts.


    I haven''t come across that error (at least as far as I can recall). I suggest
    looking at calling Database.Purge() on the layer (see <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2007/08/purging-registe.html">this
    post</a> to understand how purge() works). If that doesn''t help then please post
    your code to the discussion group linked to above.

    sorry for answering late, I''m in the ADN now, and the problem was that i can´t
    delete the current layer, so i''ll change the db.Clayer.


    Thanks,

    We want to read a table Bill of Material information written in a particular later.
    Although we can read the layer but can not read any information from it. It is
    more like text entered in a Layer. How can we read it in c#'
