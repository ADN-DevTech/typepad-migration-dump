  body: 'Hi, I am desperate to find out if one can create layer filters programmatically
    in earlier versions of AutoCAD (2008, for instance, which uses VBA, not VB/C#.NET).


    I have searched the Internet to no avail.  Please help if possible.  You can reach
    me directly at mhouldey[at]yahoo[dot]co[dot]uk.

    You might try posting your question to <a href="http://discussion.autodesk.com/forums/forum.jspa?forumID=152">the
    AutoCAD .NET Discussion Group</a>, as I really don''t have time to provide personal
    support.

    Is there an alternative to acDoc.Editor.GetCurrentView() ? while this does not
    work for Autocad 2006.. How can i get the current view as a viewtablerecord type
    in another way ?

    I used this example: <a href="http://docs.autodesk.com/ACD/2010/ENU/AutoCAD%20.NET%20Developer''s%20Guide/index.html">http://docs.autodesk.com/ACD/2010/ENU/AutoCAD%20.NET%20Developer''s%20Guide/index.html</a>'
