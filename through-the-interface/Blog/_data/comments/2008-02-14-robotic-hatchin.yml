  body: 'Hi Kean

    Good looking piece of code.

    On similar (ish) lines, do you know of any implementation of a bpoly type command.
    I am using a method at the moment to run a command line version but due to graphical
    restrictions its causing me a few problems'

  body: 'Hi Greg,


    Someone else has just asked the same question. There isn''t an easy answer, unfortunately:
    there''s no boundary detection code exposed, other than via the BOUNDARY/BPOLY/BHATCH
    commands. So you''d have to do quite a lot of work yourself, to replicate this.


    Firing a ray - as in this sample - is a good place to start, though. You would
    then collect intersection points with other entities in the drawing and perform
    some analysis on which contribute to the boundary closest to the selected point.


    The simplest approach is probably to work through your issues with running the
    BPLOY command programmatically (the ADN team will be able to help you with this).


    Regards,

    is not a curve". Why?

    Have you tried debugging to see what kind of object is getting selected?

    O yes, I tried. It''s block reference.'

    I tried to draw some lines, and use the pedit command to convert it to poly line.
    After that, I used the "Bounce" command to test it.. error: This is not a closed
    loop..'

    I seem to recall there''s now a version of IntersectWith() taking System.IntPtr
    arguments instead of using int (which allows it to work on x64).
