  body: "Really great thing!\nJust some questions that I haven't gotten:\n- When working\
    \ with LISP, does DCL's work?\n\nOnce working under Mac (BSD/Unix derivate), do\
    \ we can assume that in some time Mac will be available for other operational\
    \ systems (Linux) and also platforms that runs BSD-Like OSs (alpha, sparc, etc)?\n\
    \nFrom 10yr to now, that systems had became from specific command-line-servers\
    \ to a very (popular?!) desktop application. Does Autodesk recognize that as a\
    \ possibility of this station became usable in the office environment?\n\nThanks,\
    \ and congratulations for the presentation.... \nHope you guys can have an larger-memory\
    \ camera for the next one... :)\n\nAbout the exclusive-online version, I do prefer\
    \ downloading that rich material, but have got no problema on watching... \n\n\
    Regards!"

  body: "Hi Felipe,\n\nI'm glad you liked the recording. :-)\n\nAs I mentioned in\
    \ the podcast, this first release for the Mac is 'command-line AutoLISP' only.\
    \ We're evaluating DCL, but no decision has been made yet. I'll interpret your\
    \ question as a request that we add it in the future :-).\n\nWe're interested\
    \ in feedback from anyone who is programming AutoCAD for Mac on what APIs are\
    \ a priority for future releases.\n\nAnd you're right that porting AutoCAD to\
    \ the Mac does open up possibilities for other platforms too. However, we have\
    \ no current plans to do that. Its all a question of demand - there has to be\
    \ a critical mass of people who want to use AutoCAD on a particular OS to make\
    \ the very significant incremental cost of development, testing, and support worthwhile.\
    \ If I were making the decision (which I'm not), then I would wait for AutoCAD\
    \ for Mac to prove itself over a period of time before I embarked on a port to\
    \ any other platform. \n\nAnd I wonder if ports to specific OSs will become irrelevant\
    \ in the not to distant future as the industry moves towards cloud-based computing\
    \ and streaming technologies.\n\nCheers,\n\nStephen"
