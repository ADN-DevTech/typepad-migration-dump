    The code shows a useful technique that could easily be adapted to all sorts of
    data reporting scenarios.

  body: "<quote>\n\"The System.Text.StringBuilder is an extremely fast way\nof concatenating\
    \ strings, see the .NET help for more details on this versatile object!\"\n</quote>\n\
    \nUmmm.. The StringBuilder class is designed to allow one to avoid the overhead\
    \ of string concatentation, yet this code is littered with just that (everywhere\
    \ you see the use of the '&' operator between two string variables or constants),\
    \ which sorta makes the purpose of using the StringBulder class largely self-defeating.\n\
    \nFor example:\n\n<pre>\n\n sb.Append(txtPre & ltr.Description & txtSuf)\n\n</pre>\n\
    \nIn the above, three strings are <b>concatenated</b> into a single string, and\
    \ the resulting concatentation is then passed to the StringBuilder's Add() method.\
    \ \n\nHuh?\n\nWhat should have been done was to call the Add() method three times,\
    \ each time passing it one of the three strings as the parameter, which avoids\
    \ the needless concatentation (the StringBuilder handles this very efficiently\
    \ so the overhead of three calls to Add() is less expensive than the overhead\
    \ of concatenating the three strings together and passing that to a single call\
    \ to Add()).\n\nIf readability is a concern, then the StringBuilder's AddFormat()\
    \ method or the String.Format() methods are available, both of which also eliminate\
    \ the need for string concatentation.\n\nFor the benefit of helping the reader's\
    \ understanding of how to leverage things like the StingBuilder class, I would\
    \ also recommend studying it's AddFormat() method, which uses the same conventions\
    \ used by the String.Format() method, to avoid the wasteful overhead of all the\
    \ string concatenation we see used in this code."

  body: 'The original code Terry provided only included calls to Append() (if I recall
    correctly), and the comment was also Terry''s.


    While I was modifying the HTML generated by the code (to make it less token-heavy),
    I used string concatenation to get there (as it was a) simplest to do and b) made
    it easier to fit the blog''s formatting). I also considered that - as I was concatenating
    a number of small strings before building them into the larger one - the performance
    impact would be negligible (and I suspect impossible to notice). Which seems to
    be the case, although I''ll go ahead and change the code to just use Append()
    to see whether that changes anything much.

  body: 'Tony,


    you are right in principle. But using & is just much simpler then using Stringbuilder.
    I rarely use Stringbuilder because simply it''s not worth the effort. It is considerable
    only when you have performance problems.


    Besides that the string handling "weakness" is a  problem of the underlying framework.
    So Microsoft should take care of that and not me.
