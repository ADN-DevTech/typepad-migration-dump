    You need to use a tool such as Visual Studio or Visual Basic Express to build
    a DLL or Class Library from the source (copy and pasting the code from this blog
    into the project before building).


    I suggest getting started with these two old posts:


    <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2006/06/getting_started.html">Getting
    started with Autodesk''s APIs</a>

    <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2006/07/getting_started.html">Getting
    started with AutoCAD and .NET</a>

  body: "Hi,\n\nI am working on Custom Entity in ARX. I created Custom entity by deriving\
    \ from AcDbPolyLine. Inheritance hierarchy is as follows.\n\nAcDbPolyLine\n\t\
    CWSPolyLine\n\t\tCWSRoom\n\nI am able to create object of CWSRoom and it is working\
    \ fine.\n\nNow I created class WSPolylineGripOverrule deriving from AcDbGripOverrule\
    \ and implemented getGripPoints() and moveGripPointsAt() . \n\nIn On_kInitAppMsg()\
    \ I added following line of code.\n\nWSPolylineGripOverrule m_pWSPLineOsnapOverrule;\n\
    ASSERT(AcDbGripOverrule::addOverrule(CWSRoom::desc(), &m_pWSPLineOsnapOverrule)\
    \ != RTNORM);\n\nAcDbGripOverrule::setIsOverruling(true);\nbool bRet = AcDbGripOverrule::isOverruling();\n\
    \nSo, it will set overrule at application starup and permanently.\n\nBut after\
    \ creating the CWSRoom object in command, I am not able to see the special behavior\
    \ (additional grips and custom movement). Also it not hitting the break points\
    \ in getGripPoints() and moveGripPointsAt().\n\nCan you tell me what I did incorrect?\
    \ \nIs inheritance is problem? Or I need to add overrule after creating entities.\n\
    \nI need to create this overrule object so in future when I create new custom\
    \ entities that will use same overrule. I don’t need to repeat code in each custom\
    \ entities class."

    Similar to ''DimensionHighlightOverrule'' function, I want to get the bounding
    box detail for dimension text alone. Is there any such option available?'

    Should be possible. You may need to explode the dimension to collect its text''s
    extents.


    These posts may be of some help:
