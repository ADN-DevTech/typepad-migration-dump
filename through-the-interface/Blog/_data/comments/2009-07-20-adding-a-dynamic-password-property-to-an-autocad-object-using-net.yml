    Is there way to fill some default values for the activex-control ? I''d like to
    use combobox-control (AcPEXCtl.AcPePropertyEditorEnum.16) but have no idea how
    to fill it.'

    I think I tried to get this working, myself, if I remember correctly, but didn''t
    get there. There was probably an interface that needed exposing via .NET and implementing,
    but I didn''t have the time to follow through on it. It''s a bit of a blur, at
    this stage, I have to admit.


    Regards,

    We got it done by exposing IDynamicEnumProperty interface to .NET and implementing
    it to our Enum property.


    The functions we had to implement was:

    GetNumPropertyValues(LONG* numValues)

    GetPropValueName(LONG index, BSTR* valueName)

    GetPropValueData(LONG index, VARIANT* valueName)


    Again thanks for the guys from ADN :)'

    You could certainly implement this kind of mechanism - that''s really up to you
    - but it would take work to make it hard for sophisticated users or programmers
    to circumvent. Implementing software security is a significant undertaking and
    way beyond the scope of this blog.

  body: 'Thanks for information, Petri. I exposed IDynamicEnumProperty interface to
    .NET, but when I implement it, I have to override GetNumPropertyValues method:

    unsafe public void GetNumPropertyValues(int* numValues)


    Due to pointer in argument, I use unsafe keyword and "Allow unsafe code" in the
    project options. Is it possible to avoid unsafe code in this case?
