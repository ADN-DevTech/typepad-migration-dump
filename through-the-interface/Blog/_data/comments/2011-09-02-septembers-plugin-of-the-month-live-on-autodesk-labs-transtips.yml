  body: 'Hi Ali,


    I''m sorry you''re still having trouble.


    Here are the steps I would follow:


    1. Download the ZIP from Labs, to your desktop

    2. Unblock the ZIP by right-clicking, opening the Properties and selecting Unblock

    3. Extract the files to a folder on your desktop (or anywhere on your C:\ drive)

    4. Launch AutoCAD

    5. Run the NETLOAD command

    6. Browse to the folder on your desktop containing the ZIP contents, until you
    see the .DLL

    7. Select the DLL, select OK

    8. You should now be able to run the commands in that plugin


    I hope this helps,


    Kean
