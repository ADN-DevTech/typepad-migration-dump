    If we give it a nanosecond''s thought, what else would the DimXxxxx properties

    I take it you can guess who this is.'

    And trust me: I thought about it for at least a couple of microseconds. :-)


    I could probably guess who this is, but then again, why spend the energy when
    I clearly have a post to go and fix?

  body: 'Hi Eug,


    Xdata is limited to 16K per object, but this is a shared limit, so individual
    applications should be careful about attaching large chunks. If you''d going to
    go anywhere over 1-2K, I suggest adding Xrecords into the object''s extension
    dictionary, instead.

    sure it''s ObjectARX (C++) only, right now.


    For now you can either fire commands to create a dimension associatively or include
    a C++ component in your application.

  body: 'Hi Kean,


    Is there a way to get the boundingbox of a dimensiontext?


    I created a dimensionroutine and I want put the dimensiontext in a upper position
    if the created dimension is near the last dimension.


    With the boudingbox I hope to calculate if the dimensiontext fits between the
    two dimensionblocks.


    Kind regards,
