  body: Thank you, Kean. It was very helpful - I was not able to figure it out without
    your sample.

  body: I know that is a old post but i have a question, exist a way to stop the selection
    when the user type a especific keyword, in the callback function. What I want
    to do is to stop the getselection method to start a getentity method. Thanks!

  body: 'Interesting... you could probably set an internal flag and send a cancel
    character (ASCII 27) to the command-line to get out of GetSelection() and then
    start GetEntity().


    I haven''t actually tried this myself, though.

  body: 'Hi kean.

    Thank you for the attention.

    I decided to put in a try ... catch block, and I threw a specific error (divide
    by zero) and captured it in the try block.

    It worked very well.
