    Now if you only had a way do do Edit and Continue on a 64 bit computer. I don''t
    know if you''ve run into this, but VS cannot do edit and continue on a 64 bit
    process, and since you can''t install 32 bit AutoCAD when running 64 bit windows,
    there is not much you can do about it.'

    *If for instance you''re building an "auto-complete form" that uses linq-to-sql
    to populate standards fields and don''t want to wait for 64-bit Inventor to load
    each and every time you want to test it.'

    for the next release of Visual Studio</a>, although I dare say that''s little
    consolation for the next few years.


    When Civil 3D supported 64-bit Windows via a 32-bit executable, it was possible
    to use that for this kind of purpose (even just using the AutoCAD part of it),
    but as C3D now supports 64-bit natively (I believe), this no longer appears to
    be an option.


    So yes, a bit of a pain, I agree.

  body: 'Hi Kean,


    It''s a long time since you wrote this but on the off chance, is there a similar
    option to switch off the following error output. I think the appropriate "switchName"
    is what I need.


    System.Windows.Media.Animation Warning: 6 : Unable to perform action because the
    specified Storyboard was never applied to this object for interactive control.;
    Action=''Stop''; Storyboard=''System.Windows.Media.Animation.Storyboard''; Storyboard.HashCode=''13014940'';

    Perfect - thanks for letting me know (and before I started any research :-).


    Nice to hear from you, by the way: it''s been a while!

    I''m trying to find the intersection points between two 3D objects. Consistently
    getting an exception. Is this not possible yet? (Using the API for 2014) - would
    there be an alternative?


    Thanks in advance.

    It should work: I suggest posting some code (and a DWG, if needed to repro) via
    the appropriate discussion forum or to the ADN team, if you''re a member.
