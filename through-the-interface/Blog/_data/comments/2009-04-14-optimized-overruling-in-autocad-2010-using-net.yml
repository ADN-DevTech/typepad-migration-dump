    Excellent series of posts.  It''s exciting to see a very usable implementation
    of ''custom'' objects in .NET.  Obviously, this implementation protects what could
    be proprietary business intelligence from being sent around, but it brings up
    a question.  What process would you use to ''explode'' these elements so that
    you could send the drawing to someone without your code, but with the custom elements
    in it.


    Thanks!

    Great question!


    You can implement a TransformOverrule, implementing the Explode() method, which
    will allow your object to participate in an EXPLODE.


    I''ll cover this in the next post. :-)

    One suggestion, the ''REGEN3'' command can actually be written in managed code
    quite easily (it''s basically just a call to AcGsModel::invalidate() and a redraw).


    I''ve added that code to the latest update of the sample I posted at the link
    below.

  body: 'Hi Kean,


    For various reasons I''ve got loads of code in VBA that cannot be used for much
    longer with AutoCAD. VBA ships with my Civil 3D 2010, but will it be there in
    2011?

    I need to move over to .NET, that is clear, but what language would you recommend?

    Is there an easy way of translating VBA code into .NET code or do I have to do
    it all manually and theres lots of it!?


    Your advice would be most welcome.

  body: 'Hi Ben,


    I don''t know what the plan is for VBA in the next release of Civil 3D (and wouldn''t
    be able to communicate it publicly, if I did).


    About migrating away from VBA, in general terms...


    On the one hand I wouldn''t count on VBA disappearing completely in the near term
    (for most of our products it is available as a separate download and I don''t
    know of plans to stop doing that), but on the other hand I think moving away from
    VBA makes a lot of sense (as much as anything its partial support on 64-bit platforms
    will cause you performance problems once Civil 3D becomes available as a native
    64-bit version).


    As for moving to .NET... the logical language to move to from VBA is VB.NET. As
    .NET languages have great support for COM, the simplest first step is to auto-migrate
    the code to call through COM rather than the managed APIs. The migration wizard
    built into Visual Studio apparently does a great job of this, by the way, the
    problem is that it only accepts VB6 projects, not VBA.


    A member of my team, Stephen Preston, is working on a tool and an accompanying
    DevTV session to demonstrate how to migrate from VBA to VB.NET (the tool actually
    converts VBA to VB6 projects, which can then be loaded into the migration wizard).
    These should be posted here in the coming weeks.

  body: 'Hi Kean,


    Thanks for the advice.


    I''ve used the migration wizard in Visual Studio a couple of times on VB6 code
    with mixed success, it can deal with the vast majority of the code directly and
    marks up the parts that need ''polishing up'' by hand.


    The tool from Stephen will be a great help and save me loads of time and sweat.
    Will it also deal with the forms as well as the code?


    I''ve been using VB.NET for stand alone applications for a long time, but as yet
    I''ve not used it with AutoCAD or Civil 3D. I have a couple of books somewhere
    with advice on writing VB for AutoCAD, I guess now''s the time to dust them off
    ;-)


    Thanks again and I''m looking forward to Stephen''s post.
