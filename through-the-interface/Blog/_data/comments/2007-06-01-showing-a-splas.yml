    I''m sorry - I don''t understand the question...


    If you''re asking which assembly references to add to your project, then you need
    acdbmgd.dll and acmgd.dll.

    I''m afraid. A programmer should be able to work it out pretty quickly, though,

    I don''t know why this is happening on your system. Are you executing code from
    the dialog itself, rather than just using it as a splashscreen?

    Are you loading you dll from a network share? If so you will get this issue. Make
    sure you build and load your dll from the local drive.

    But this will run and show splash screen when I load it

    manualy by giving netload command.
