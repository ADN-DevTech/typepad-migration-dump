    I really like your AutoLogo or LogoCAD! :)


    Now my old college Logo classes into Civil Engineering graduation came back to
    my mind!!!


    Great idea and maybe AutoCAD can be used to teach kids and pre-school children.


    Maybe the next steps would add an input point monitor to detect arrow clicks,
    space bar to PenUp/PenDown, maybe a "ALT+C" command to type a new pen color number
    and a "ALT+W" to type a new pen width.


    Regards,

    Fernando.'

    That would indeed be fun. :-)

    To add a cherry to the cake you would draw a turtle as the command cursor. :)

    10 also. I learned some basic and programmed text based games at that time also.


    Thanks for bringing back some memories. :)
