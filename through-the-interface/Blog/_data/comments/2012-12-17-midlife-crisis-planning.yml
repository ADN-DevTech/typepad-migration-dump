    I wish you a happy midlife crisis :)

    You make me realize how important it is to plan it correctly, only six years remaining
    for me, time to find interesting ideas!


    cheers

  body: 'Hi Loic,


    Thanks! :-)


    I''ve been getting all sorts of ideas... it''s finally time for me to do something
    with the Arduino, for instance. I''ll be getting my Arduino Starter Kit for Christmas
    (I know this because I bought it myself ;-), so that should give me something
    to play with for the winter.


    Cheers,


    Kean'

    Nope, no idea what you''re talking about...


    As for this little bit of pre-crisis planning, it just screams "presenting the
    case for a major assault on the credit card" to me. In which case, good luck.


    I''d suggest a week in Vegas instead, but haven''t you just come back from there..?


    Looking forward to seeing what you end up getting away with!'

    my wife''s motion sickness - which she only escapes when in the driver''s seat
    - would presumably get in the way, somewhat (of me actually getting to drive,
    at least ;-).

    It&#39;s like me buying two season tickets to Reading and then expressing &quot;surprise&quot;
