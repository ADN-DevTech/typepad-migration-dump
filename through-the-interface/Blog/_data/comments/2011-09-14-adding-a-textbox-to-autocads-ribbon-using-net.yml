    Just making a ''link'' with the previous post..


    One of the requirements for posting Apps to AutodeskExchange is the cuix files..

    Is ther any problem on making the Ribbon population programatically, with panels,
    buttons, etc, and not deliver the cuix file?


    Thanks,

    Felipe

    SP/Brazil


    p.s.: are you comming for AU Brazil 2010?'

    I would certainly use a CUIX file for the primary interface for an application,
    but there are cases where you might want to create and control items programmatically.


    I wish I was coming to AU Brazil - only Las Vegas for me, this year.

  body: 'To reinforce, Kean''s comment - two rules for Exchange store apps are:


    1. Plug-ins must not load on startup unless there is a very good reason why it
    has to. (I.e. you have to convince us its a good reason).

    2. Exchange apps must install a ribbon panel to the Plug-ins tab or create their
    own tab.


    You can''t create a ribbon dynamically before your app is loaded, so those two
    rules mean that adding your ribbon at runtime isn''t a good idea. (Although, as
    Kean said, you can always add basic elements through a CUI and add more dynamically
    after the app has loaded).


    Another good reason why using a CUI is better - we can tweak your CUI for you
    if its not quite right. If you create your riboon elements at runtime, then we
    have to ask you to edit your code.


    HTH,
