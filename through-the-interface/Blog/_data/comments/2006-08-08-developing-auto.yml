  body: I am a newbie when it comes to programing in ACAD, actually i am a newbie
    when it comes to programming all together.  Is there a book or website that you
    recommend for learning how to program in ACAD, specifically C3D.

    I don’t know of any books currently available about the Civil3D API… other than
    what you can glean from the discussion groups, there’s quite a lot of information
    (and unlimited support) available through ADN. It costs money, but we’re worth
    it… :-)

    \ Is there any way I can pick a profile from drawing in .net? \n\n\nThank you,\

    \ above and I keep getting the same exception.  I added references to AeccXLandLib,\
    \ AeccXUiLandLib, AecXBase and a couple others.  The error is after this line:\n\
    m_oAeccApp = m_oAcadApp.GetInterfaceObject(\"AeccXUiLand.AeccApplication\")\n\
    it throws the \"Failed to Load the Civil 3D Application!\" error.  This is in\

  body: "Hi Kean,\n\nIs it necessary, to list the imports\nwithin each form or module?\
    \ Or can the\nimports be put in one place.  In vb/vba with\ncivil3d it is customary\
    \ to invoke the \ncivil3d app publicly in a module so the\nrest of the app can\
    \ use the reference.  I\nam assuming there is a correct place to put all the needed\
    \ import references for autocad and civil3d in one place in vb Net?"
