  body: 'Hi Kean,

    Sometimes I wish Autodesk would put money into solving long lived actual problems
    like the reg apps problem that still plagues AutoCad dwgs.  If they have money
    for sponsoring things like the TED event, they surely can invest in sweeping problems
    with existing products. I did look at the list of speakers at that event, I too
    would like to listen to some of them.  Tha papercutter artist one in particular.  There
    is an instant watch video from netflix called "between the folds" I think.  Funny
    name, but absolutely amazing what the master paper folders can do.  I also like
    the Rivers and Tides video. Right along the TED conference line of thought...'

  body: 'Hi James,


    Well, I guess we see things differently.


    In my view Autodesk has worked really hard to provide the ability to remove excess
    RegAppIds (which were mostly created by incorrectly coded external applications
    rather than AutoCAD itself), whether via AutoCAD PURGE or external tools. I''ve
    also invested significant effort myself to help you through this problem via a
    recent series of blog posts.


    If there''s still a significant customer issue then I''m confident AutoCAD Product
    Management will hear about it and take appropriate action.


    The fact that we invest money in something that is a great resource to the community
    - and that I''m personally proud we''re associated with - is really a separate
    question.


    Regards,

  body: 'Hi Kean,

    I sould have been more specific.

    Your efforts on the reg app issue have been great, and are separate from the effort
    I was referring to - that of fixing the problem permanently so your team did not
    have to keep dealing with it. I did not mean to puish your good deeds, I apologize
    as I probably managed to do so.  I am curious, though, what kind of effort you
    think it would take to change the behaviour where regapps stay in a drawing even
    when the infecting xref is detached.

    Both the sponsorship and fixing behind the scenes issues are needed, its two good
    things at once.

    I did get a kick out of the TED conference Patron category cost, $125,000. Even
    the cheap seats in Palm springs for $3500 got my attention. The youtube videos
    are really neat though, so even if the event is a bit restricted, we get to benefit
    from it later.'

    I''d be really interested to see the Photofly output from that "Bullet-camera"
    - as I''m sure you are.


    It strikes me as the kind of application that a series of  Kinects should be able
    to accomplish - not that I have any of them to have a go. :(


    Cheers,


    Alex.'

  body: 'That''s cool! I would have guessed at them using an RGB-D camera for the
    3D capture (the resulting headshots are very Kinect-like), but apparently not.


    I''ll have to look at the "making of" video, when I get some time.
