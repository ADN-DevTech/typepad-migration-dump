    Is it language a new wrapper for ObjectARX? Which object model it used? What reasons
    of creation of this language? Is it for Windows only, or no?

  body: 'There are similarities, in that Dr Aish was also the person responsible for
    the creation of GC for Bentley. But it''s quite different in approach (from what
    I''m led to believe - I''m not familiar with GC, myself). It''s probably fair
    to say Dr Aish has applied the knowledge he gained from the implementation of
    GC in his work on DesignScript (i.e. I''d expect it to go beyond what is possible
    with GC).

  body: 'Hi Andrey,


    Deep down the connection to AutoCAD geometry is performed via ObjectARX, but this
    is much more than a simple object model abstraction layer. It''s the language''s
    associativity - and how that works with respect to AutoCAD geometry - that really
    makes it stand out.


    I''ll follow up on Monday with an explanation of some key differences between
    DesignScript and what is currently available in AutoCAD.


    I''m pretty sure this is Windows only, yes.


    Cheers,

  body: since VSTA never happened, does Autodesk see this as its replacement for VBA?
    Does autodesk feel a gap is left by VBA's exit?

  body: 'Hi James,


    I don''t know about the positioning around VBA, that''s not my world. :)


    However, DesignScript was built from the ground up with the idea of supporting
    people creating interesting geometries.


    As such, it''s optimised for a slightly different set of concerns than an application
    automation language. So I would see it as a complement to things like VBA or AutoLISP,
    one more for exploration than automation.


    Having said which, one of the useful features of DesignScript is that it provides
    an easy interaction layer with anything .NET/C#/VBA.NETish. So where''s there''s
    an automation API, we should be able to drive it through DesignScript :)'

  body: Is DesignScript exposed through any .NET APIs?  Is it strictly a scripting
    language or does it also provide methods for user input?

  body: 'Good questions... my understanding of the vision for DesignScript is that
    its "exploratory" nature should at some point be extended to dynamic manipulation
    of DesignScript variables. So you may have some kind of in-canvas gizmo or UI
    that would allow you to adjust variables and see the results on your model in
    real-time.


    As for interfacing with .NET... I don''t think it will in the way you''re asking,
    but there will be a Foreign Function Interface (FFI) as Luke has mentioned that
    allows you to interface external systems with DesignScript via .NET. But that''s
    more integrating systems to provide data (as we''ve done with Ecotect) rather
    than allowing .NET apps to drive DesignScript.


    Again, that''s my understanding of what''s possible (or expected to be, at some
    point).

  body: 'Hi Kean,

    Interesting stuff this DesignScript, especially since I am working on a similar
    concept, for AutoCad 2013, and having met Dr Aish many years ago in a London based
    introduction to GC, this spurned me on to do something for ACAD.


    I do have a question here, which bears some relevance to your statement about
    heavy use of Transient Graphics, and one on which I am completely stuck: Why can
    we not create a Transient Polyline3d? I really need to be able to draw transient
    3d polylines, and it seems impossible to do.


    Hope you can shed some light.

    Regards

    John.'

  body: 'Hi John,


    I suspect it''s because the Polyline3d object is still a "complex" one (which
    means it''s composed of multiple sub-entities, whereas the Polyline object is
    a streamlined version of the complex equivalent, Polyline2d). Creating and managing
    temporary Polyline3d objects would probably end up being trickier than expressing
    your own 3D object in terms of smaller linear (or curved) sections.


    I''ve done something similar in the past, jigging a 3D polyline as individual
    segments before creating a final Polyline3d in the drawing database:
