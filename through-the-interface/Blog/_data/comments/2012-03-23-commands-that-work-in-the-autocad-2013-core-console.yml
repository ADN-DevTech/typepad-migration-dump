    A couple of things got me to this point: I was previously taking more than just
    the command through from the text file (for more descriptive logging), but then
    decided to back that out.


    And as the code is basically disposable, in the sense that I''ve posted it for
    posterity (and admittedly should have taken more care considering it was being
    posted), but won''t be using it again anytime soon.


    Thanks for (anonymously) keeping me honest! ;-)

    That''s correct: I should probably have pointed out that this is really a single-document
    experience. You open the console with the drawing of your choice - or multiple
    consoles for multiple drawings - but we don''t have MDI-like document switching
    in a single console.

    I''d expect Autoloader and demand-loading to work (although I admit I haven''t
    tried either, so I may be overly optimistic), but otherwise you can always use
    ARXLOAD for .dbx/.crx and NETLOAD for .dll files.

    FLATSHOT made it onto the list as it didn''t generate an "unknown command" error:
    as far as I can tell it doesn''t do anything useful as it stands, however.


    What you really need is a new command-line version of the command (i.e. -FLATSHOT),
    of course: the best would be to submit this request to the ADN team, whether via
    the ADN site or the appropriate discussion forum.

    I included in the script the lisp load function to load up the lisp defuns I needed.

    Did I read that you should use the actual command in the script and not wrapped
    in ''(command..'' calls.

    Should I do the lisp files loading from acad.lsp as part of the profile that I
    use rather than from the script?  At one point I tried to multiple ways to delete

    I would load the LISP from the script, personally.
