  body: 'Hi Kean, have you tried this on larger images, like a 24"x36" sheet converted
    to tif at 600 dpi?

    That is 14400x21600 pixels.

    I ask because it has been tricky to find libraries that handle large images. GIMP
    and Image Magik both do, and Raster design also. Curious if basic autocad can
    also.

    thanks'

  body: 'Hi James,


    I tried it one a PNG with 2448x3264 resolution and it took the best part of a
    weekend. Great results when it did finish, though!


    My code currently resizes larger input images to make the processing time more
    reasonable. I''m also fooling around with parallel algorithms (using map-reduce)
    in the cloud, to see whether it''s possible to throw compute resources at the
    problem to get there more quickly.


    We''ll see!

  body: "Hi Kean,\n\nI'm a novice C# Developer but have just started using it for\
    \ Revit and even more recently, Autocad. Can you point me to any C# specific and,\
    \ more importantly, full documentation on the objects, methods, etc for Autocad's\
    \ .NET API? \n\nSo far I've only found things related to VB or perhaps some small\
    \ examples here and there for c# - incredibly frustrating to say the least.\n\n\
    Great post and Thanks in advance!!"

    I''d start with <a href="http://autodesk.com/developautocad">the AutoCAD Developer
    Center</a>, especially <a href="http://docs.autodesk.com/ACD/2014/ENU/files/GUID-4E1AAFA9-740E-4097-800C-CAED09CDFF12.htm">the
    AutoCAD .NET Developer''s Guide</a> linked to from there.


    I hope this helps,
