  body: 'Hello Kean,


    I think that an approach that would solve the hand fatigue issue, would be the
    one where the device would be suspended somehow, facing the desktop surface, eventually
    combined with a second device, placed sideways and perpendicular to the desktop
    surface, facing the user''s hands (optimal vertical positioning for this one remains
    to be determined).


    I believe that this kind of setup would enable the current "modus operandi" combined
    with the ability to read the user''s hands and fingers gestures on the desktop
    surface, which would become thereby a kind of a larger "touch pad".


    By alternating spatial gestures with desktop surface level gestures (which would
    allow the user to lean his hands and wrists), the overall interaction would become
    less tiring, while still providing a lot of flexibility.


    And no, I don’t pretend royalties for this idea (joke aside, I''m convinced that
    the people at Leap Motion have thought already about something similar) 


    Regards,


    Constantin'

  body: 'Hi Kean,


    I think that in short time this kind of technology will be obsolete as brain-computer
    interfaces get mature, actually there are a couple of commercial products from
    NeuroSky that show some potential. Other thing is the vision of a future with
    people stay sitting and connected to a computer with no apparent physical movements,
    but "working".


    Best Regards,

  body: wait a minute, those brain devices are not reading thoughts, they are like
    thermometers on an engine to try to tell what gear its in. I had not seen the
    neurosky mindwave before, so thanks for the mention of it, we'll see where it
    goes. I keep thinking, "what is the interface we would want, if we could have
    anything, excluding direct real thoughts from our brain." We have to have a clue
    how the brain works before the thought input thing. Isnt it funny though, that
    we don't understand our own brain...or light, gravity, mass...wow where are we
    anyway?

  body: oh, forgot to mention, what is the interface to? In the case of Civil engineers,
    we don't even have decent software yet for modeling real life things like underground
    utilities and roads/grading. An "ideal" interface to what we have now would not
    help much.

    \ 2 orders of magnitude better interface speed (bidirectional human-pc-human)\
    \ that we actually have, you will not need the best software to do the work, you\
    \ would be able to process images using paint, not photoshop.\nAs for a decent\
    \ Civil software, I think you and colleagues (ASCE,ICE, etc) need to elaborate\
    \ and expose your needs, and then,collaborate directly with the software providers.\

  body: 'I would personally think that using a tool like this for markup would be
    a little cumbersome. Technically it could work (although it would have to be an
    Autodesk rather than a 3rd party integration), but I''m not sure it''s in the
    technology''s "sweet spot".


    That said, with the right gestures implemented perhaps it''d be useable enough.
    I''d expect to see the ground broken elsewhere on that, though.
