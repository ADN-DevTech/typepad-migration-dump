  body: 'Hi Kean,


    After a bit of investigation, I''ve discovered that (should you want to) you can
    change the BannerBitmap default for <b>all</b> pages of the user interface without
    having to edit each one individually.


    <i>NB: This does of course mean that all future applications would have the same
    banner; so for my Application I chose our company logo.</i>


    This page details how: <a href="http://bit.ly/hatcbh">http://bit.ly/hatcbh</a>

  body: 'Also, I only modified the VsdUserInterface.wim file(s) located in the 0 &
    1033 subfolders of c:\program files\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\Common7\Tools\Deployment\VsdDialogs\
    to make my application work correctly.


    Users of other language versions will need to work out which folder to edit (over
    and above the neutral 0 folder).
