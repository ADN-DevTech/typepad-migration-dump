    Why some of the ObjectARX include files contains deprecated CRT functions ?


    ex: acdmmutils.h, asdkpromptbase.h contains ::wcscpy

  body: 'Hi Zoltan,


    I think it''s a question of timing: for the majority of the AutoCAD 2007 development
    cycle we were building with VC7.1 - VC8 only showed up quite late in the day (and
    it''s in VC8 that the _s functions were introduced). So I think it''s most likely
    an oversight due to the timing of the Visual Studio release.


    If this impacts your use of the ObjectARX headers, please submit your request
    via DevHelp Online (as I see you''re an ADN member). I''d pass it on myself, but
    I don''t want to encourage the use of this blog as a channel for support.


    Regards,

    Great blog.  Even though I only understand a small amount of your blog, it can
    only help people like myself learn better techniques in less time.  Not to mention
    that it''s about time the guys behind the programs had their say!

  body: 'Hi Plais,


    The biggest change is likely to be Unicode, which came during the migration from
    2004-6 to 2007-9. Otherwise the moves from 2000-2 to 2004-6 and from 2009-10 were
    mostly related to language changes in the compiler (unless you have custom objects,
    which would make the change to 2010 a little more arduous).


    Your best bets are to work through the Migration Guides in the ObjectARX SDKs
    for AutoCAD 2004 (if you can find it), AutoCAD 2007 and AutoCAD 2010.


    Good luck!

    Thank you for your hints. I''m already going through the process o checking the
    2004 and the 2007 migration guides. Yes, I do have some custom objects, so I have
    a lot of work to do. But as always, I will count on the help of the ADN''s professionals.
    I''m having some chat with Augusto from São Paulo office and It''s been of great
    help.
