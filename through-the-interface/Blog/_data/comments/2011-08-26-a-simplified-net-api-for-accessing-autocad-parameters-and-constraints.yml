    I pinged Philippe about this, and he very quickly created and tested an x64-compatible
    library. I''ve updated the link in the post.


    Please take a look and let us know if you have any feedback.


    Regards,


    Kean'

  body: 'Kean,

    I am trying to use the library in VS2010, and followed your instructions.  The
    application compiles properly, but on the first call to the library, I get:


    {"Could not load file or assembly ''AdskAdnAssocConstraintAPIMgd.dll'' or one
    of its dependencies. The specified module could not be found.":"AdskAdnAssocConstraintAPIMgd.dll"}


    I pointed to the DLL using the Add Reference.  The dll was in the adnassocconstraintapi\bin
    release\x64 folder.  I have also tried moving it and the library file to my solution
    folder.


    Can you please help as to why the file cannot be found?  What is the ":" in the
    message above?


    Thank you'

    I had to NETLOAD the DLL.  Fine.  But I am using it with Autocad 2013 and am getting
    a message that it is incompatible.


    Is there an AutoCAD 2013 compatible version of the library?


    Thanks'

  body: 'Hi David,


    As far as I recall the version posted there was compiled against 2012 SDK, so
    you need to migrate the settings for all projects in order to build against the
    2013 SDK, compile the arx part using patform toolset V100, .Net framework 4.0...

    I''ve tested that lib on my side under 2013, so I can assure you it works.

    I hope it helps,

    Philippe.'

  body: Any chance to get the code in C#? The Utils are amazing but lack a bit when
    working with polylines. E.g. try to apply a coincident constraint between two
    polylines (start point of "polyline A" to end point of "polyline B") -> it fails
    with a runtime exception.

  body: Hi Matthias, I would need to take a look in details why it fails. But the
    full source code is provided along with the download, the lib is written in C++,
    but if you run it from the debugger, you will be able to break inside the managed
    and unmanaged code to see where the problem is...
