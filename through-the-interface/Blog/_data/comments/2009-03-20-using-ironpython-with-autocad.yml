    When I get my hands on a non-trial version of 2009 PyAcad.NET will be replaced

    That''s odd. I was under the impression he already knew about that one, from this

    doing much internet browsing at that time.

    I do take requests for posts - when I feel they''re relevant to a broad audience
    - but I tend not to develop detailed samples in LISP, these days.

    I''m not sure what exactly you''re looking for, an acknowledgement that you had
    figured this out first before Kean pointed it out to me? I explicitly stated that
    I didn''t see your post as it was posted a couple days after I was married. I
    had been trying to accomplish registering commands from IronPython for ~3 years,
    don''t you think I would have at least replied to your post or actually attempted
    it had I saw it?'

    What is it that doesn''t work in AutoCAD 2014? I don''t really have time to look
