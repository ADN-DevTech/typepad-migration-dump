  body: 'Crazy, isn''t it? It seems to happen when I''m recording video - not sure
    why. And of course we''re recording a Parallels VM, which is going to cause it
    to run at least a bit hotter, but still.


    Also I''m using the in-built microphone, which seems to do a great job of exaggerating
    keyboard presses and the fan. Must be a positional thing.

  body: "Hello Kean, \nThanks for this useful post!\nI just want to point out some\
    \ things I found while trying your sources, where some of them gave me errors\
    \ while developing with SharpDX 2.4.2 (newest version at the moment).\nHere they\
    \ are:\n*) Colors in ApollonianRenderer.cs should be addressed as Color (method\
    \ SpheresFromJson(string), and  Render(TargetBase )).\n*) All the methods which\
    \ were calling to Component>>SafeDispose(<T>), is now deprecated in 2.4.2. I replaced\
    \ it for Component>>RemoveToDispose(<T>), assuming that's the same behaviour than\
    \ before.\n*) Finally, the viewport you use in SwapChainTargetBase (method CreateSizeDependentResources(TargetBase))\
    \ is using SharpDX.Direct3D11.Viewport(float, float, float, float, float), which\
    \ should be SharpDX.Viewport(int, int, int, float, float).\n\nAgain, thanks for\
    \ your useful post"

    I''m pretty sure all these changes have been made to the projects provided with
    my class material from AU 2012:

    My apologies for not posting them directly here (it slipped my mind).

    You may need to edit one or more project files (.sln, .vcproj, etc.) in a text
