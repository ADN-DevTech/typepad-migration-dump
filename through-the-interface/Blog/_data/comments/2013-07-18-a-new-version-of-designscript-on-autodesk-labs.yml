  body: 'Its interesting that civil engineers have always had to use a parametric
    system for roads and pipes, namely that of PI''s in plan, and PVI''s for profile,
    yet Autodesk itself reverted to "part based" design for pipe networks and feature
    lines in C3D. I''m not sure how often this kind of thing happens, but I see a
    lot of "rediscovery" going on at autodesk. Shall I wajor AutoLisp will someday
    be touted as the most powerful scripting language of any CAD program? I''ve already
    seen this trend when windows went from .ini files for settings, to databases,
    now its turning back to text files for settings more and more.

    I watched a couple of the videos on the lab site. I thought the design script
    code looked more confusing than regular c#. I do wish I could figure out a system
    to have beginners lay out a flowchart, then fill in code and have the flowchart
    somehow reflect it. It would be a todo list for a program.'

  body: 'Well, maybe.


    Maybe it''s worth looking at trends from a programming language perspective: back
    in the day, most application providers rolled their own language. <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2008/09/an-interview--1.html">We
    adopted XLISP because it was free and fitted in 64K of memory</a>. Then came a
    trend towards industry-standard languages to allow programmers from other domains
    to more easily engage on projects and better integrate external software (etc.).
    Now some people (I''m thinking particularly about Finance, but it has also happened
    in other industries) are looking at Design Specific Languages (DSLs) that help
    provide "separation of concerns", so industry specialists don''t need to care
    about acquiring general-purposed programming skills.


    Whether or not you consider DesignScript a DSL isn''t really the point, but it
    has its purpose. Robert and Luke will (at some point - they''re very busy) provide
    a few posts that position the language more clearly for this blog''s readership.

  body: 'Is there really enough people out there for something like DesignScript who
    say "I can learn DS, but have no time for C#"? I would think the only ones that
    can handle the coding are those already good at coding.

    The node graph is very interesting, I wonder if there is something like that for
    c#.'

  body: 'This is targeted at quite a different population (many of whom are not even
    using AutoCAD, right now), so I wouldn''t expect the normal assumptions to hold.


    At some point I''ll receive content from Robert and Luke that I''ll share on this
    blog to help position the technology more clearly.

  body: Will the stand alone DS version allow you to import the results into AutoCAD
    2012? Currently DS only works for 2013 and above.

  body: 'Good question... I don''t believe the standalone app can create anything
    like a DWG file (the thing you''re meant to carry across into AutoCAD is the script
    itself, not the results).


    So I''m guessing you''re sadly out of luck, there. The DWG output from DS in AutoCAD
    2013/2014 can (of course) be used back in AutoCAD 2012.

  body: 'I suggest that the ability to export a DWG or DXF file from the stand alone
    DS would be a great addition that would potentially broaden the user base to those
    (myself included) with older versions of AutoCAD.


    It could also make DS CAD agnostic since most CAD software out there will import
    DWG or at least DXF.


    This would make DS like the stand alone Bentley GenerativeComponents and would
    also separate DS from Rhino Grasshopper which currently requires Rhino 5 to run
    it.
