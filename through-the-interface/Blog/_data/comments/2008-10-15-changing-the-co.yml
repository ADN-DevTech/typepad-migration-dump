  body: 'Kean,

    I was looking back at some of your posts, and noticed one on F#.  It had the pretty
    green 3d math plotting pictures.

    You mentioned that you used the mouse middle click to do something, and that it
    sometimes needed a "drag" for the handler to kick in.

    I believe this is exactly the same problem I''ve been running into with the snap
    menu, and the behavior started in Acad 2006, when the CUI system was introduced.

    What I do is set mbuttonpan to 1.  Then set my side mouse button as middle button.

    For the wheel click, I set my mouse driver to run keystroke F11, which brings
    up the snap menu due to having set F11 to do that in the acad CUI.

    Works great, but you must move the mouse after clicking the wheel, or no snap
    menu.

    This messes me up because I type the mnemonic of the snap, the mous stays still
    while doing so.  I end up typing before the snap menu shows and it messes up the
    input, have to cancel out.


    Is there any possibility of ridding the need to move the mouse, for the handler
    to kick in?

    I really like realtime pan on side button, and osnap menu on wheel click, but
    have abandoned it for mbuttonpan set to 0 for now...

    thx'

  body: 'James,


    The form this occurs in has nothing much to do with AutoCAD: it''s a modal form
    thrown up by AutoCAD using DirectX to view a pretty 3D graph. So I suspect the
    problem I hit is a general Windows programming issue: something to do with window
    messages coming through from the mouse. Maybe it''s the same one you''re hitting,
    maybe not.


    Beyond me, I''m afraid - and there''s no great need for me to fix this for the
    demo app I''ve thrown together - but hopefully you''ll manage to work it out.

    I have tried this example. It''s looks ok, but actually it will create 2 layers
    of the block.'

    Sorry - I don''t understand what you mean. This sample doesn''t create or modify
    layers in any way - perhaps you can explain the problem differently?

  body: 'Hi Kean,


    In my plugin, I use blocks to represents different objects. Quite often I need
    to place in the drawing more than a reference to the same block definition. Each
    reference represents the same object but with different choices of colors/materials
    for the components (3D solids) that constitute the object.


    Is it possiblle to set different colors/materials for different block references
    to the same block definition?


    Thanks'

  body: 'Hi Antonio,


    This is slightly off topic - please ask in future on the appropriate AutoCAD discussion
    forum.


    You can choose to have certain components in the block marked as having their
    colour "by layer" or "by block" (which mean they take the colour of the layer
    the block reference is on or the colour of the block itself), but I don''t know
    of a standard way to enable more that two different colours.


    You may be able to implement a DrawableOverrule to add this capability, but it
    would probably be quite a bit of work.
