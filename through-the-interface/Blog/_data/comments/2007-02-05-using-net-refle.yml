  body: 'Hi Kean,


    Coincidently, some days ago I was wondering about mapping the AcDbDwgFiler types
    to corresponding .NET types. Doing this we could create some kind of .NET filer
    were we can copy into information from native ObjectARX objects, change them from
    .NET and then write back.


    Sometimes when I have a sub-object inside my custom entity and I would like to
    make a "partial" rollback feature I write out the data to a AcDbDeepCloneFiler,
    perform the modifications and, at the end I can keep changes or roll back with
    dwgInFields() from the same filer.


    The bad portion of this solution is that we cannot discover what each value inside
    this DWG filer represents but as it is a sequential binary file we can assume
    some order for each type of entity.


    Today I''m missing some kind of AcDbXMLFiler or AcDbDWFFiler which could save
    a lot of time...but this is another subject!


    Just some crazy ideas to keep users frying their brains! :)


    Regards,

    Fernando.
