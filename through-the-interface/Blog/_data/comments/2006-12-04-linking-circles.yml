    I''m curious as to the rationale behind implementing a destructor to unhook your
    event callbacks, when it always fails...the document/database is LONG gone when
    the destructor fires.


    I''ve always used DocumentToBeDestroyed to unhook these sort of events...as I
    said, just curious.


    Nice sample btw...keep it coming.


    Cheers,

    Glenn.'

    in this situation, as this command is essentailly document centric. ie An instance
    on the LinkingCommands class is spun up for each document where the command is

    Thanks for the comments.


    Yes - you''re quite right: right now, while .NET modules cannot be unloaded from
    AutoCAD, this code will never be called in time. Frankly, though, if AutoCAD is
    shutting down, then as long as it doesn''t create strange behaviour or cause an
    exception, I''ll just leave my app there to be unloaded with AutoCAD.


    This code is really there *just in case* something ever changes to allow us to
    support manual unloading of .NET modules (by all accounts that would take quite
    a radical way in the way the .NET Framework works, so it *is* unlikely to be necessary).


    Regards,


    Kean'
