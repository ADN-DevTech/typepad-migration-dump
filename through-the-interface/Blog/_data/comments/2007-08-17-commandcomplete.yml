  body: 'According to <a href="http://labs.autodesk.com/graduates/command_complete_bonus_tool_for_/">this
    page</a> the tool is no longer available via Labs. I don''t know of an alternate
    distribution mechanism for this, I''m afraid.


    I suggest posting a comment on Scott''s blog, if you''d like more information.
