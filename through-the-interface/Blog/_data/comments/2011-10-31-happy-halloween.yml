    I was pretty pleased with the face paint, especially as I managed to do most of
    it myself (I needed a bit of help with the back of my head - I missed a few spots).


    Maybe that would be a good one for AU - "you''ve heard of the Blue Man Show, now
    it''s time to meet the Orange Man!" ;-)

    You could make it talk too. Add a real floating black cloak, and you have some
    serious effects going on.

    I have to say though, I think you might have to have someone else do the soundtrack
    and lip synch for you. The vids I''ve seen of yourself, Fenton, and Stephen reveal
    the most civilized voices I''ve ever heard :)'

    Brits may sound civilised, but that''s often far from the truth, trust me. In
    fact, we regularly meet up after work to bite the heads off chickens.


    Hmmm - and don''t most screen villains have British accents? OK, OK - maybe "most"
    is overstating it somewhat, but it''s <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilBrit">very
    often the case</a>.


    Mouahahahaha...

  body: 'well, you were a pretty good sport to post your face painted pic, I think
    I''m to lazy to put that much makeup on.

    On another subject, i have always been into woodworking and hobby items like molded
    composite RC gliders.  I have been looking at DIY CNC routers and thinking of
    using them to make scale replicas of land development projects. I would imagine
    that would someday tie into your point cloud models.  Users might like making
    the models more if they could then 3d print them.  Autodesk should buy you a makerbot
    jsut for marketing purposes.'

    You might be interested in checking out some of the projects on <a href="http://instructables.com">http://instructables.com</a>
    (a recent addition to the Autodesk family). I would love to spend time getting
    into the whole Maker scene - it seems like a lot of fun(although as I''m first
    and foremost a programmer, I''m happy with most of my constructs remaining virtual
    :-).
