  body: 'You will need to install Visual Studio (or Visual C# Express) and then build
    a class library (a DLL) including this code, by following the steps in this post:

    Then you should be able to NETLOAD the DLL into AutoCAD and execute the AIOBJECTSCALEREMOVEOTHERS
    command.

  body: 'Unfortunately I can''t just send you compiled product functionality. Working
    for a publicly-traded company there are acounting rules around revenue recognition
    that mean I can''t just send you something pre-built.


    Perhaps another reader of the blog or someone on the discussion groups would be
    kind enough to build the code into an app for you, but I''m unfortunately not
    at liberty to do so.

    Thanks Kean &#8211; I posted a query on the Autodesk forum and someone kindly
    did the Visual Studio stuff for me as I didn&#8217;t have a clue where to start.
    Thanks for the link explaining how to create the DLL &#8211; I&#8217;ll be taking
    a look at it so I know for the next time&#8230;!!!! &nbsp;

    The code seems very useful. But I have a feeling majority of folks out there would
    not have a clue how to start.


    So this is, as more instructions are needed, for a very select group.


    I hope one day I will understand.


    Thanks'

    Do you need instructions on how to build this into a working app or on what the
    code is doing?


    There are other posts dealing with the former - the latter is harder: the code
    is already pretty well commented.

    I finally got it to work on 2014. Used VS 2012.

    I first looked into this post and others looking for a solution to a duplicate
    scale of 1:1 problem. This command doesn''t get rid of problem but will be of
    very good use to my folks.


    Obrigado
