  body: 'Hi Kean,


    I''m used to read blogs with Google Reader just like any regular developer. Unfortunally,
    your blog doesn''t support full post reading in Google Reader.


    It will be great if you could create such a feature.


    Thanks.'

  body: 'Hi Ari,


    Is it my blog, in particular, that doesn''t work, or is it a) all TypePad blogs
    or b) all Autodesk blogs?


    I believe some people manage to read using Google Reader (which - perhaps because
    I''m not a regular developer - I don''t use ;-) because I see it in the viewing
    statistics. Perhaps they''ll not using full post reading, though.


    Ah - hang on... is this about having the full post in the RSS feed? That''s a
    deliberate choice... my posts are mostly too long to push out completely via RSS
    (they break various netiquette rules about RSS size - hence the decision to send
    out excerpts + links).


    Regards,


    Kean'

  body: 'Hi Weslley,


    Same question as for the previous comment: is this a TypePad issue, an Autodesk
    blog issue, or just my specific blog?


    Depending on the answer there''s a limit to what I can do (and there may be, anyway).

    I can do full blog reading in Google Reader with the blog below. I think is not
    a problem with TypePad.


    <a href="http://civilizeddevelopment.typepad.com/">http://civilizeddevelopment.typepad.com/</a>


    What kind of reader do you use?


    PS: Thinking about the size of your posts I think you''re right in your decision.

  body: 'Hi Ari,


    I actually just use Outlook for RSS reading.


    I do think this is because of RSS: Isaac publishes his full content via RSS.


    So I''m afraid this unlikely to change anytime soon.

    I''ve emailed Websense to try to recategorise these two blogs (which will hopefully
    allow you to read their comments, too).
