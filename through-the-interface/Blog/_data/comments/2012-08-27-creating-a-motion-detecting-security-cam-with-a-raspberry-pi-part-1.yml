    Finland most of i seen are alarm system and CCTV cameras which help many business

    my own trail cams for hunting. I have decided to try using raspberry pi and the
    new camera feature it will be releasing soon. I''d like to incorporate your idea
    of the security cams with my trail cams. But my trail cams will need an IR light,
    usb motion detector(i''m assuming i need that) and SSD, and batteries and a solar
    panel. the ultimate goal is to have multiple units that talk with each other to
    create a network and send the data back to the house via long range, scheduled
    uploads... What are your thoughts?

    Thanks, -rich'

    It should work if you follow the steps to the letter...

  body: 'Kean,


    First, thank you for posting this! Sometimes I like to dig in and learn something
    before trying but sometimes I just want to "plug it in and make it work" and then
    find the details later.


    Anyway, I have followed the steps you outline and all the pieces work independently
    but I found that the motion.conf file you posted does not have anything configured
    for "on_movie_end" so I added a line (based on what Tricia wrote above). So that
    got me one step further. Now what I see is a single .avi file in my ~/motion folder
    but a number of .jpg files. And when the python script runs it complains that
    none of the .jpg files match the .avi file - due to the fact that the .jpg files
    have a -00 or -01 appended to the base name. I''m guessing this is something I
    need to configure in the motion.conf file but I was wondering if you have updated
    your copy to include this?


    Thanks,

    -Keith'

    Are you sure you have the right file? <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/files/motion.conf">This
    file</a> has an entry for on_movie_end, so I have a doubt...

    First I want to say thank you for your post, it''s inspiring me..

    I recently learning python for gaming and now I got a homework from my college
    to make a project, and I interest with your project...

    And my questions is python can support to make software like ''motion'' and is
    there any tutorial or step by step to make it??

    thank you for your time...'

  body: 'Hi Devina,


    I''d expect most serious low-level software components (such as Motion), would
    be implemented in a language that''s "closer to the metal", such as C or C++.
    That said, you can do some fairly impressive things in Python (I''ll be posting
    some code in the coming days that probably fits that description).

    Since Motion cannot capture at the full capability of the Raspberry PI camera,
    is it possible that Motion can just trigger raspivid to take video for 10 seconds
    with full hd on motion detection rather than doing itself?'
