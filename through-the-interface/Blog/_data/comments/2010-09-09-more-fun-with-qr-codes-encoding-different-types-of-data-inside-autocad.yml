    I''m trying to think of a way to incorporate the QR codes into our plotting system....

    Is this going to be a plugin of the month?'

    Please do let me know if you see any disadvantages with the use of rasters rather
    than native geometry, as you look more deeply into this.

  body: 'Hi Kean,

    At first I was fine with them being raster, however I''m not sure I like the idea
    of them being stored online.

    If the service is ever down, then I''ll loss my QR codes. And if there was a way
    to store them locally that would be great. Even better on a network location,
    so when someone else opens the file, it''s still found.


    So I think I talked myself out of the raster idea, if they where just SOLID objects
    in a block stored in the DWG, then that would solve all the referencing issues..


    Also, I compiled you code above & the QR image doesn''t show up when placed in
    paperspace, but it does show in the reference palette...'

  body: "Hi Kean,\n\nNice plugin again. Instead of using\na online service for creating\
    \ the\nQR code you can use a library to \ngenerate them offline.\nTake a look\
    \ at the follow page on\nthe code project:\n<a href=\"http://www.codeproject.com/KB/cs/qrcode.aspx\"\
    >http://www.codeproject.com/KB/cs/qrcode.aspx</a>\nIt's an open source library\
    \ to encode\nand decode QR codes. With some extra effort\none can create an jpg\
    \ and attach it."

  body: 'Hi Barry,


    Thanks for taking a closer look.


    The images should get cached locally - they really only need the server to be
    up when they go to another machine. But yes, having them in an external file is
    less than ideal. It''s just so much simpler to code and maintain. ;-)


    I''ll take a look at the paperspace issue...

  body: 'Hi Stephan,


    Thanks - I''m aware of a few such libraries... the existing implementation was
    done primarily for initial simplicity, as a proof of concept.


    I''m starting to lean towards looking at a fully embedded solution, but we''ll
    see.

    I could foresee a plot system that uploads the DWG to Butterfly and adds a QR
    code URL to that file. Then when you''re on-site with the hard-copy prints, you
    could edit that DWG on the spot as needed....'
