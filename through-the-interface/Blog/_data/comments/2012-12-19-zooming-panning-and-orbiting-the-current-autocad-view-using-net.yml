    Happy new year!


    Is it possible to create image by giving camera location, target and a projection
    matrix parameter(like FOV, aspect ration, far/near plane distance) through .Net
    API?


    Many thanks,

    ali'

  body: Currently, in our project, we convert autocad model by FBX convertor and load
    it again by separate graphic library(directx or openGL) to get a customize view(image)
    from a point. So, I was just wondering if that's possible to create this custom
    image within autocad since the model is already rendered?

    You could certainly do something like that. This post may be of some help for
    capturing the image:


    <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2007/04/taking_a_snapsh.html">http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2007/04/taking_a_snapsh.html</a>


    Setting up the view should also be possible via a ViewTableRecord - as shown in
    this post.


    Regards,
