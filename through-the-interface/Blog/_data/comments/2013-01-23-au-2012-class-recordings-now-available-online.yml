  body: 'It''s a shame that they haven''t recorded Christer''s GrumpyBlocks class!
    It was by far the most enjoyable class I''ve attended at AU. And it made the flight
    back home shorter: point clouds with physics is <i>really</i> fun...'

  body: 'I know, Tilo - I was very disappointed to have missed it, as I had another
    class at the same time. That said, Christer and I had talked about the implementation
    for quite some time while he was developing it at the internal APPHACK. So I get
    the basics, at least.


    I''m glad you got a lot out of the class... looking forward to seeing what you
    guys use the technology for! :-)

    P.S. I''ve been playing with Kinect Fusion... expect some posts on that after
    its public release.'

    You''ll probably be aware that the technology guys behind the Kinect recently
    released an amazingly tiny 3D data capturing device (<a href="http://www.primesense.com/news/fast-company-a-look-at-the-new-kinect-for-smartphones/).">http://www.primesense.com/news/fast-company-a-look-at-the-new-kinect-for-smartphones/).</a>
    Soon we''ll have our own little 3D scanner in our pockets!'

    Yes - I did see that. Seems as though it''s only black & white, for now, but hey
    - the fact you get depth from something that small is indeed amazing.
