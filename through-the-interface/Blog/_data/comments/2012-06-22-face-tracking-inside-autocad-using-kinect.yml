  body: 'Hi Kean


    I''ve been a great fan of your blog but right now I start wondering if you may
    have lost contact to reality.


    IOW: do you think that your post above covers any of the real world challenges
    that are out there in the market?


    I may be short-sighted or incompetent with regards to what the market is after,
    but for me all or your recent posts seem to be directed towards introducing some
    new features within AutoCAD which are even less usefull than what''s being implemented
    in AutoCAD 2013 now.


    Totally understand Autodesks need to introduce features which will help selling
    the product but nevertheless, I am concerned about the acutual users being left
    alone to fight with a half-baked hardly funtional product because the marketing
    devision has decided to push for AutoCAD WD, AutoCAD 360, etc.


    As customization of AutoCAD is key to the game of making a difference to the competition,
    your blog (and the newly created DEV BLOG) have always been greatly appreciated
    for the content being delivered.


    Nevertheless: could you please come up with some clarfication about what this
    blog is intended to provide in the future?


    Cheers'

  body: 'Hi Toby,


    I appreciate the frank feedback.


    You should firstly be aware that I''m not blogging about future features inside
    AutoCAD. As I work for a publicly traded company, I''m not allowed to talk about
    those until officially announced.


    Historically I''ve split my time between day-to-day AutoCAD programming issues
    and more future-oriented material. Now that the DevBlog is available - and members
    of the ADN team are generating huge amounts of "day-to-day" content - I''m spending
    more of my blogging time focused on new features (such as the AutoCAD Core Console)
    and directions in which I see the industry to be heading.


    Such areas include cloud computing (or distributed, scalable computing - whatever
    you''d prefer to call it), natural user interfaces (NUIs), 3D printing and reality
    capture. These are all industry trends I see impacting the design software industry
    significantly, over time.


    And the point is not to generate new AutoCAD product features, rather to provide
    some manner of inspiration to our development community - along with concrete
    code samples showing exactly how certain things are done.


    So no, I don''t expect anyone to say "wow - I can actually track my face inside
    AutoCAD, how useful!", but even if a few people decided to take some of the code
    I''ve provided - or the techniques I’ve demonstrated - and do something useful
    for their customers - even if it has nothing to do with this particular capability
    or even with Autodesk software - then I''ll have achieved something.


    Now it could very well be that I''m misjudging the topics that interest people.
    I hope/believe that some people are interested in what I''m putting out there.
    That said, while this blog is for all of you out there reading it, it is also
    very much for me: I''ve followed some very interesting coding journeys over the
    time I''ve been writing it - in directions that I wouldn''t have followed without
    being inspired by discussion with readers.


    At this stage it would be nice to hear whether readers agree with this approach
    or would prefer me to focus more on day-to-day nuts & bolts - which I will continue
    to do, anyway, when I come across important topics that have neither been addressed
    here or on the DevBlog(s).


    I hope this helps clarify some of my intentions and personal motivations.

  body: 'Toby: I totally disagree because reality capture <i>is</i> a "real world
    challenge"! Over the last few years big game changers have entered the field:
    affordable laserscanners (like FARO Focus 3D), mobile mapping systems, photogrammetry
    in the cloud (Project Photofly) to name just a few. And I believe the Kinect (or
    similiar systems) will be game changers, too. And having some fun along the way
    cannot be a fault :)


    Please, Kean, keep going!'

    \ by the minute in content. \n\nIts definitely inspiring, a few years ago at AU\
    \ they were demoing how you can rotate 3d models by holding some abstract object\
    \ in front of 2 cameras with different angles. This is essentially the same thing\
    \ with just kinect."

  body: "Hey! I was wondering if you can help me out here! :) I'm a undergrad student\
    \ at NTU, Singapore. I have a research project in which I've to create a 3D face\
    \ of a \"real\" person & then get that 3D face to speak whatever I want. I found\
    \ your posts very interesting! You are doing a brilliant job with Kinect! You\
    \ mentioned the \"FaceTracking3D sample\"? Where can I find this? Also, you said\
    \ that initially you superimposed the 3D mesh over the image. Can you make that\
    \ code available for me? \n\nAs the 1st phase of my project, I was thinking of\
    \ generating a 3D face of Person A as the \"avatar\" & then perhaps another Person\
    \ B could stand in front of the Kinect sensor & speak out words. Using face tracking,\
    \ I'll know the lip movements of Person B & can then get Person A's 3D avatar\
    \ to say it... \n\nI am a total newbie to Kinect :p And I'm just trying to learn\

  body: 'Start by clicking the link in the post to get to the Kinect 1.5 SDK, and
    from there click on the "Step 2" link to download the developer toolkit.


    Once you''ve installed that, you should find a browser app that take you through
    the various SDK/toolkit samples - there''s a really nice C++ sample that animates
    a custom avatar, that may help you (assuming you know C++).
