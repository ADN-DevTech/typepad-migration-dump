  body: 'Hi Kean,


    I wonder how did you make the Leap Motion working with a Win 8 VM hosted on a
    mac. I have a Win 8 hosted by paralells desktop 9 , mac. but it did work out with
    the virtual win 8 .


    Thanks with your article!!!!'

  body: 'Hi John,


    I''m using Parallels Desktop 8 on my Mac with a Win7 VM for Leap Motion and it
    works very well.


    Of course you have to install the Windows version of the runtime in the VM - and
    make sure the USB device gets attached to the VM rather than the Mac - but otherwise
    it all worked fine. I assume Win 8 is similar, but have only run inside Win 8
    on my native Windows machine.


    I hope this helps,


    Kean'

  body: "Hi Kean,\n\nNice article : ) I've gotten a question on using Leap Motion\
    \ on virtual machines. \n\nI just bought myself a leap motion, too. And I'm using\
    \ a Macbook pro retina display which works fine with my leap motion. However,\
    \ when I want to try it on my windows 8.1 which I installed on Parallel Desktop\
    \ 9, it performs poorly... As matter of fact, it firstly gives me a warning saying\
    \ I don't have the proprietary graphic driver installed when i tried to install\
    \ the leap motion launcher. But I ignored it (since i couldn't found appropriate\
    \ driver for the virtual machine). So I installed the leap motion launcher anyway,\
    \ and it will run, but have a rather low frame rate, about 20-30 fps...\n\nSo\
    \ it seems that your leap motion running perfectly on your virtual machine, did\
    \ you install any specific graphic driver on your virtual machine in order to\
    \ make it work properly?\n\nThanks a lot,\n\nBest regards,\n\nMichael"

  body: 'Hi Michael,


    I also get a somewhat lower refresh rate inside Win 7 on Parallels Desktop 8 (I
    run Win 8.1 natively on a differently system), but it''s certainly good enough
    for my purposes.


    I don''t have a specific driver - I also get the same install warning, for instance
    - but I seem to recall fiddling with some settings, way back when (perhaps adjusting
    the priority of speed over accuracy).


    But I don''t have many insights: of late I''ve been doing most of my demos natively.


    Regards,


    Kean
