  body: 'Hi there Kean,

    Everything I’ve seen on your Web site is fabulous.

    I have two questions for you:

    1. Is it possible to post the loadable files of all your C#, C++, F# source files
    posted here on your Web site, past and future, for people like me who do not have
    all those compilers?  Or at least, can you please send me those loadable files
    via e-mail, if there is a server space issue?

    2. Can you please show me how can I find out if a MTEXT object is Annotative or
    not?  If “YES”, would you please post, or send it to me via e-mail, both source
    and loadable forms of that application?  Apparently, this it is not feasible neither
    in AutoLISP, nor in VLISP or VBA for AutoCAD, so that the only hope is perhaps
    using .NET.

    Thank you in advance for any help.

    Best regards,

    Stefan'

  body: 'Hi Stefan,


    Thank you.


    My responses:


    1. At some point I may spend the time to tidy up my source files and post them
    in an archive, but unfortunately I haven''t been very disciplined about maintaining
    a clean set of files for all my posts (some of the include additional test code
    I inserted based on comments, etc. etc.). So the effort on my side might prove
    prohibitive (I wish I''d though about this 2 years ago, but there you go).


    2. Check out <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2007/04/making_autocad_.html">this
    post</a>, which shows how to make an MTEXT object annotative. You should  be able
    to check whether it''s Annotative property is AnnotativeStates.True.


    Regards,


    Kean'

  body: 'Good morning Kean,

    Thanks for your prompt response and pointing me in the right direction.

    As I said, I do not have any of the C #, C++, F #, etc. compilers.

    Therefore, can you please send me that application as a loadable and executable
    file?

    Before that, can you please make that application to deliver a “nil” or “T” in
    a variable usable in an AutoLISP or VLISP application, if a selected MTEXT is
    Annotative or not?

    Thanks in advance for your help.

    Have a nice day.

    Best regards,

    Stefan'

    You can download Express versions of these compilers which should work (and are
    typically free). I don''t distribute compiled modules, only source. My site is
    about helping developers solve programming issues, not providing custom development
    services.
