    If you are running inside of AutoCAD, another option is:


    Autodesk.AutoCAD.Internal.TrueColorPicker'

  body: "Hi Kean,\n\nFirst of all, thanks for the excellent post.\n\nI get some unexpected\
    \ results when I work with colours in AutoCAD. The first problem is choosing colours\
    \ using ACI method. It seems that whatever index I pass in, it ends up in the\
    \ Blue value of the returning colour, so an absolute non-sense colour is made,\
    \ and furthermore the colour for well-known indices doesn't get a proper name.\n\
    Finally colour indices are different in various colour books, and I couldn't find\
    \ any way of setting let's say active colour book. \n\nAutodesk.AutoCAD.Colors.Color\
    \ redFromColorIndex = Autodesk.AutoCAD.Colors.Color.FromColorIndex(Autodesk.AutoCAD.Colors.ColorMethod.ByAci,\
    \ 1); // colour index 1 is for Red\nAssert.AreEqual(255, redFromColorIndex.Red);\
    \ // should be 255 but it is 0\nAssert.AreEqual(0, redFromColorIndex.Green);\n\
    Assert.AreEqual(0, redFromColorIndex.Blue); // should be 0 but it is 1\n\nThanks\
    \ for the help in advance."

  body: 'As we saw in this post, it''s not as straightforward to go from a colour
    index to an RGB: AutoCAD maintains and uses an internal mapping and so creating
    a colour "by ACI" and querying its RGB values won''t work.


    See the ColorOf() method in this post to go from an ACI to RGB.
