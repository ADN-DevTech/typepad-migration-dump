    I''m a regular of both blogs, Jeremy''s and yours.


    Switching between different ToolTip localizations is a funny thing, but where
    is the advantage if the other UI elements remain in their former language ?


    The next lines refer more to Revit, but you easily can replace Revit with AutoCAD:


    It would be interesting to know how to change the text of *any* UI element (e.g.
    RibbonItems, title of a dialog, category names in the Project Browser tree or
    property names in the property sheet).


    If it would be possible to change the UI texts at runtime, Autodesk could simplify
    the delivering process.


    Okay, I know that there is special content for different countries (RTEs, RFTs),
    but the main program stays the same, as far as I can see.

    What about delivering a language-independent Revit with the localized content
    being just a plug-in ?

    Since it is not possible to run both English and German Revit on the same machine,
    one could develop (and test) localized plug-ins without the need of installing
    other Revits in VMs.


    Cheers,

    Jeremy had forwarded me your comment from his blog, and I was planning to respond
    today, anyway. :-)


    For languages where we provide full-blown localization: no, there is clearly no
    advantage to having translated tooltips. But there are many languages that do
    not have formal translations available.


    I''m working closely with our Localization team to determine ways to enable more
    "field" localization of our products: right now our products require a great deal
    of effort to localize... they are understandably complex with many internal dependencies.
    Our various translatable resources - for many of our products - are in separate
    sets of DLLs (which are grouped into Language Packs, which can even be switched
    at runtime for some of our products), which makes the process to some degree simpler.
    But the tesing requirements are still extremely high: maintaining quality in these
    situations is just a hard problem.


    We are working on the problem: providing tooltip localization won''t work for
    everyone, I agree, but for many it''s a start, and is downstream of deeper (and
    riskier) internal changes.


    To answer your last question, I expect more of our products to adopt Language
    Pack (and Language Switching) infrastructure over the coming years, which will
    help a lot. I''ll be continuing to investigate additional options related to broadening
    the ability to translate our software, especially for "tertiary" markets. Tooltips
    may help for some of these, but it certainly won''t be the final answer for all.

    wow, that''s a quick response.


    Yes, I understand what you mean.

    There are many internal dependencies, and: never change a running system, of course.


    I know that many Autodesk products are evolved organically, meaning there is much
    old stuff and code. Additionally, people expect Autodesk to support backward compatibility
    for every esoteric programming language, making the job not easier for your dev
    team.


    I also know that they are on their way and that it will take some *years* to clean
    up the code for so many different products.


    Thus, I will be patient.


    By the way, talking about AdWindows.dll:

    did you ever pimp your Ribbon bar? ;-)'

    And I have the code ready to share, when I finally get around to it... :-)
