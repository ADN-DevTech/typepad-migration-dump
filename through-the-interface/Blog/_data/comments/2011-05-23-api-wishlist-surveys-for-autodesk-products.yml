    Better property palette support.....


    If you whine long enough, do you win :)


    For a hack programmer like myself, the current implementation is just too difficult
    to implement for day to day programming. That level of integration (support on
    the AutoCAD property palette) truly would bring my application to a professional
    level. Users have expectations; in particular, the ability to edit properties
    on the property palette is one of them. It''s high time this gets properly addressed.'

    Sometimes the reason we''re not visibly resolving something isn''t because it''s
    not important, it''s that deeper infrastructure work is needed for us to provide
    a holistic solution (one example is Overrules, our main answer to the custom objects
    from .NET question).


    We definitely hear your need (and feel you pain), but please don''t stop reminding
    us until we get there.

  body: In my survey, I totally forgot to request the ability to manage options, basically
    anything in the Options dialog.  I have a routine that resets a user's profile,
    and the only way to do it (without lisp) is via ActiveX.  I would prefer a .NET
    solution.
