  body: 'Cool. I was thinking there could be some integration between autocad and
    a netduino, since both talk c#.

    In particular, I am looking to make a 3 axis router that does things with info
    from autocad. The netduino community already has code for controlling the stepper
    motors from g code, but I bet I could modify to run off vectors from acad. Its
    true about so many choices, too many good things at once!
