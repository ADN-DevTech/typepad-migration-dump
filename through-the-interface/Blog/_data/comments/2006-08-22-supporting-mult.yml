  body: 'There are no headers for .NET, and therefore nothing that could be picked
    up by the pre-processor.


    You could probably use reflection to query the type information at runtime (or
    the version of the product/assemblies used), but it gets messy. It would have
    the advantage of not needing different apps for different versions, however.


    As for ObjectARX, there is a wishlist in the system for a version indicator in
    the headers that can be queried by the pre-processor.

    This is a classic problem: a new generation of development technology gets introduced
    but you need to support legacy product versions for which it is not available.
    The same happened for VBA and ObjectARX, too. One option would be to implement
    new features only for newer versions using the new technology, gradually phasing
    it into existing code. Otherwise you would unfortunately either have to use old
    technology (a waste of time & energy) or wait for the new technology to be available
    across all supported versions of the product.

    As a beginner with C# and AutoCAD, what are the essentials I need to start a project?

    Have you anything in your archives that I could use as a "getting started" guide?


    Thanks in advance

    Re-activating the theme, I didn''t understand how I will reference the "acmgd"
    and "acdbmgd", for the both two (o "N") versions that I want my application to
    be compatible?

    If possible, will it make possible to run the same binary in diferent versions
    of AutoCAD?


    Thanks again,

    Felipe

    You should use assemblies that match the oldest AutoCAD version you want to support.
    We do try to maintain forward compatibility, where possible, but you may find
    some changes in behaviour as bugs get fixed (etc.).


    I''ve just been building an AutoCAD 2010 application with the 2007 libraries,
    for instance. I just can''t depend on newer API capabilities, of course.

    Is there any possibilities to separate the acdbmgd.dll,acmgd.dll,accoremgd.dll
    files and write into one acad.dll by refecting all the class,method,properties
    in the 3 COMS?

    And then we only need to using ''acad.dll''

    so the program will adopt for all the acad versions

    haha

  body: 'Hi swaywood,


    Anything is possible, but there is a good reason for them being separate. Some
    applications only want to use acdbmgd.dll, some want to use acdbmgd.dll and accoremgd.dll
    and some want to use all three.


    Building applications against these compartmentalised allows host applications
    for RealDWG and our AcCore implementation to load the first two categories of
    application.


    It may be slightly more cumbersome for people just developing for AutoCAD, but
    architecturally speaking it makes much more sense.
