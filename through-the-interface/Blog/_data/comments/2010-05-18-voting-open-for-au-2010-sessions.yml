  body: 'Nothing against F#, but I would have to ask if the title of the F# session
    suggests one needs F# to exploit parallel computing.


    The .NET Framework 4.0, and the Reactive Framework Extensions (Rx) for .NET 3.5,
    both offer extensive support for parallel execution with C#.'

  body: 'You''re absolutely right, and - even if not covered in the synopsis - I''ll
    be making it clear that there are options while staying in C# (and may even go
    as far as to code some up, for comparison).


    This is primarily going to be a very specific look at how to integrate F# into
    a C# project and some of the advantages of doing so (some of which may not be
    immediately obvious from this particular example).


    Thanks for the input, Tony.
