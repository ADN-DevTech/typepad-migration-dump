  body: 'Hi Bob,


    It should work with any AutoCAD object (including those added by vertical applications),
    although I haven''t specifically tested it with Civil 3D objects.


    There may also be things like inter-object references that you need to take into
    account, so I suggest proceeding with caution.

    You''re right: care must be taken when swapping objects which reference or depend
    on other objects (beyond the standard layer/linetype etc.).


    It was never a "use case" for this code to work with anchored ACA objects, for
    instance, but perhaps I should have made that clear in the post itself.

  body: 'Hi Kean,

    when I swap to linetypes (from the linetype table) then I have problems afterward
    with the table. It seems to me that i miss some kind of update of the table data.
    For example if I swap the linetypes "Demo" and "Demo2" then the method LtTable.Has("Demo2")
    returns true, as expected, however LtTable.Has("Demo") returns true before but
    false after the swapping. Any ideas? Thanks.

    Kind regards,

    Stephan'

    I haven''t swapped symbol table records in quite this way, but it doesn''t seem
    right, somehow.


    Please post your question via ADN or to the AutoCAD .NET discussion group (as
    mentioned in this post).


    Thanks,
