    Yes - once again I''ve been using AutoCAD 2007 and haven''t checked the code against
    prior versions. If upgrading is not an option, you should be able to use P/Invoke
    to call ads_regen() and acedGrDraw(). See this post for instructions on where
    to start:

    If someone manages to call these functions effectively from 2006, perhaps they
    can post the function declarations changes as a comment...

    really a great job!!


    I''m a beginner in autocad developing and I need to create a commandmethod to
    perform a rotation with an entity (a polyline-rectangle) in which the rotation
    point is the centre of the rectangle... is it possible?


    Thanx in advance...

  body: 'Hi Flea,


    Yes, it''s quite possible... the tricky piece will be determining the "center"
    of an arbitrary closed polyline. One "easy" way would be to generate a region
    from the polyline and extrude it (probably by a very small, or zero amount, if
    it lets you do that), and then get the mass properties to get the centroid. To
    be sure you may want to project the point back on the polyline''s plane.


    As you can probably tell, I''ve never tried this myself.


    If you can assume the polyline is rectangular, then things are easier: you can
    get the intersection of diagonal lines going between opposite corners. These lines
    needn''t be added to a drawing.


    Good luck!

  body: 'Hi Kean,


    I found the center point getting the intersection of the diagonal lines and performed
    the rotation statically for each of the four vertices in this way:


    Point2d ptToRotate = pline.GetPoint2dAt(i);

    pline.SetPointAt(i, ptToRotate.RotateBy(Convert.ToDouble((180 * angRes.Value)
    / Math.PI), ptCenter));


    Now my problem is that, after the first rotation, following rotations will rotate
    the rectangle by a prompted angle without considering the actual angle of the
    rectangle, but only relating to the center point. In practice, if I''ve already
    rotated my rect by 180° and now select a 270° angle, I need that my rect rotate
    only by 90° (the difference between angle selected and actual angle), and not
    by 270° (like it actually do).


    Thanks in advance for your kindness.

  body: 'That''s tricky: the rectangle doesn''t have any notion of a rotation angle
    - it''s a polyline between points. So you need to either create a custom rectangle
    object or attach the current rotation angle as XData and pick it up from there.

    Just looking around and this post was found on "mass properties". I am trying
    to find how to get the mass properties for a region (specifically the centroid
    and principal moments). It can possibly be done by manually running (send command)
    the massprop command, writing the output to a text file, then pick up the text
    file and stripping it down. Not too slick though. Is there any way in c# to get
    the mass props directly??'

    DevNote</a> shows how to trap the output of the MASSPROPS command by temporarily
    replacing the HostApplicationServices object with your own for the duration of
    the command. It uses ObjectARX (C++) - I don''t know if this is possible from
    C#... you can implement HostApplicationServices objects from C# for use with RealDWG,
    so I''m hopeful it is.


    I''ll think about turning this into a post - would be a useful one to show.

    This sounds like functionality that is present in Map, but not base AutoCAD (at
