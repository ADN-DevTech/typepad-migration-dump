    some of my earlier testing.  I have a dll loading at startup so I''ll be sure
    to check it there.


    Thanks again!

  body: 'Hi Kean,


    Really interesting behavior.

    What about .NET DLLs placed into .NET Assembly Cache?


    BTW, this raises another question. Which is the best option for .NET DLLs. Place
    them inside AutoCAD''s root folder or inside GAC?


    I have faced some issues regarding to NETLOAD loading the .NET DLL we expect...


    Best regards,

    Fernando.'

    The recommendation I''ve heard is to use AutoCAD''s root folder. I''m not sure
    of the benefits or disadvantages of using the GAC.

  body: "Kean,\n\nYes. I'm doing this way. The problem is when you need to support\
    \ multiple versions and flavors of AutoCAD. It's not a good idea to have the same\
    \ DLL copied inside each AutoCAD folder. \n\nIn this case would be the Autodesk\
    \ Commom folder a better solution?\n\nMaybe place the DLLs at the product folder\
    \ and add its path to each AutoCAD support path list?\n\nRegards,"

  body: 'I don''t know that it''s "not a good idea"... we''ve gone back to a per-product
    install of lots of our "shared" files: it helps avoid compatibility issues if
    a shared file is badly "upgraded" by one of the sharing products. It also gives
    more flexibility to have per-product implementations.


    The choice is ultimately yours, of course.

  body: "Kean,\n\nYes, it will be always a pain to support multiple versions and there\
    \ is no magic solution. All solutions will always give you both good and bad things.\n\
    \nIn fact, in my opinion, GAC does not solve this problem once it allows several\
    \ copies of the same named DLL but with different versions. This may confuse and\
    \ create more problems than solutions. For me, the so called \"DLL hell\" was\
    \ just renamed to \"GAC Hell\". For instance, in my machine I can see two copies\
    \ of \"Autodesk.AutoCAD.Interop\". One has version 17.0.54.0 and the other 17.1.51.0.\
    \ Even worst, there are 10 copies of \"Microsoft.DirectX.Direct3DX\" DLLs.\n\n\
    You are 100% right. The most secure way is to keep specific versions, per product,\
    \ inside its directory and only share global modules that may not affect the way\
    \ each version works after each update or service pack. \n\nThanks for sharing\
    \ your (Autodesk) experience with this. This type of information is very important\
    \ and should be at SDK documentation too. :)\n\nRegards,"

    That was really helpful to understand what is goofing up with the modules I was
    trying to load.


    Just wondering if there is any way in ACAD (ACAD Command, Don''t want to set it
    from .net modules) to explicit set the CurrentDirectory to userdefined path.




    Thanks!

    even that requires a restart, I forget).


    You might try posting to the discussion groups, to get opinions from there.
