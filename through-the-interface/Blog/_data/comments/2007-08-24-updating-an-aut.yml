  body: Thanks you for this example. Is it possible to create a datalink from an in-memory
    DataSet, XML file, etc? I want to be able to use the table update feature but
    I don't want to be stuck with an external XLS file.

    You can certainly use an in-memory object to create a table but I don''t see how
    you''d then link to it (which would seem to require a physical file).
