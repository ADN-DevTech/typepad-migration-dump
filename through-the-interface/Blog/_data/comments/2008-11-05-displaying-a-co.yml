  body: "Hi Kean, \n\nNot to pick on you, but I was just responding to a post on the\
    \ discussion groups about this post, and I noticed this:\n\nMenuItem smi = new\
    \ MenuItem(\"Sub Item One\");\nsmi.Click +=\n   new EventHandler(Commands.OnClick);\n\
    this.MenuItems.Add(smi);\n\nshould be MI.MenuItems.Add(smi); \n\nIf you actually\
    \ want it to be a 'Sub Item'\n\nAlso, when I did a subitem, I didn't add a handler\
    \ to the parent item, and it turns out (I tested it) that the menuitem which is\
    \ the parent of subitems did not fire an event even though one was added."

    fires its own events.


    Thanks for the note, David.
