  body: I'd like to see you involved in the Civil side of things also. Not that that
    area is deficient somewhow, but that many issues are similar. For instance, data
    sharing. You will be making models and sharing the parts. Does that happen via
    extenal database, external xml's, something like vault...and so on. The issue
    of splitting up data and displaying things assembled is key to getting users to
    trust and use the tools. C3D needs a revamp in that area, and I would love to
    see the teams at Autodesk work together for one solution or at least a common
    set of options for data storing/sharing.

  body: 'Hi James,


    Unfortunately that''s not my area. There''s lots being done around sharing via
    online tools (such as AutoCAD WS, now called AutoCAD 360), so hopefully something
    will come up there that meets your needs.


    Regards,

  body: 'You may think its not, but the building industries are all tied together.
    Just depends if you deal with writing feature specs, or simply implement something
    already decided on. Either way, the cloud based efforts Autodesk is doing are
    simply an incremental change on sharing already written stuff. The data sharing
    I am talking about is architectural. Things like the ability to access c3d objects
    a whole drawing at a time, instead of one by one. The idea that I must have a
    read-only heavy aec object in my drawing to access its data is nuts for real civil
    industry. LDT had that, C3D is actually miles behind due to the lack of it.
