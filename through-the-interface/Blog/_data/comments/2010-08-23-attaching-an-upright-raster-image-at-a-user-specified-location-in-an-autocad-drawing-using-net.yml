    This is only tangentially related to this post: please post such questions via
    ADN or the discussion group in future.


    I''d expect there to be a property on the RasterImageDef class (I see an IsLoaded
    property, for instance). Have you tried checking in the debugger what happens
    between sessions where the image is there and then removed?


    This should be really easy for you to check.

    I don''t have time to debug custom modifications to the code in my posts. Could
    you please post a complete sample via the AutoCAD .NET Discussion Group?
