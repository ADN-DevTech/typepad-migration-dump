    First, thank you for this great sample.


    I was wondering if you are familiar with the Entity Mark concept widely used on
    technical projects like steel structures, engineering drawings, mechanical projects,
    etc.


    The concept is: if you have two or more elements, that has equal properties except
    its position, they can be grouped through a single mark name so they can be exchanged.


    Taking your sample as an example, you set blocks with sequential numbers but if
    you change a little bit you code it could also be used to make unique entity marks.


    This is the way I think it would work:


    1) Ask the user for the mark prefix, normally a couple of chars like "MK";


    2) Walk through the entities and extract block attributes (except the attribute
    you are using for numbering);


    3) For each block definition, store it attributes into a cache;


    4) Before you give it a new mark, search into your cache and look for a block
    definition where all attributes match to the new one;


    5) If a match is found, just use the same mark without increment the counter;


    6) If a match is not found, increment the mark counter and store it into your
    cache.


    As this would be based on generic Attributes it would serve for generic purposes.

    This sample help me for improve my "BOM Application".

    Can you extend this sample for generation bill of material. Perhaps using the
    CAO library.


    Thanks,

    This is off topic: please submit your question via ADN support (if you''re a member)
    or post it to the appropriate AutoCAD discussion group.


    Fernando -


    Entity marks do sound like an interesting enhancement - I''ll have a think about
    whether they make sense for this sample.


    Genésio -


    I''m thinking of completing the original request to generate some simple comma-delimited
    output based on the bubble list. If you need something more complex, do explain,
    but it may be out of this sample''s scope.

    I would like to know if I can create a dll with WPF Window in Acad 2008? If so,
    how do I create it? I tried adding a WPF to a Class Library, but it is not possible.
