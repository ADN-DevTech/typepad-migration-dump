  body: I havent had a chance to play with this yet, but will. Didn't realise there
    was an association between the sketch and underlying geometry. Have I read that
    correctly?

  body: 'Yes, there''s an association between each underlay layer and the model. You
    can paint above and below an underlay layer, a you wish, and force it to then
    reflect any changes in the model.


    Pretty cool stuff.

  body: 'That does look cool. I guess the sketch links to the geometry in the same
    way that Autodesk Inventor functions?


    Also, I can''t seem to get the preview to install on my machine. It''s running
    Windows 7 & Autodesk Inventor Professional 2010. Which means the installer only
    sees AutoCAD Mechanical 2010; any ideas as to how I can fix this and get the package
    to install?'

  body: 'Yes, the underlay layer has a link to the geometry and can be updated (manually)
    to reflect geometry changes.


    On the installation issue: I suggest emailing <a href="mailto:labs.acad.aliassketch@autodesk.com">the
    Alias Sketch for AutoCAD feedback alias</a>, to see if they can help.
