  body: 'HI Kean,

    I downloaded the example and the program hides the Properties and Sheet Windows
    from appearing which is what I am trying to achieve. However I comment out the
    CleanupUI(..) fuction and it has no effect as the Properties and Sheet Windows
    still do not appear. The handled.State = true; in the OnExecuteCommandEx event
    handler is what is disabling these windows when and entity is selected.  I am
    using C Sharp and can use the CleanupUI(..) functionality, but only on a OnLMouseButtonDn
    event handler. I still see the windows popup then disappear. I dont want them
    to appear at all. Is the handled.State functionality available in C# or just JavaScript'

    I haven''t used the ADR API from C#, myself. I suggest asking the <a href="http://adn.autodesk.com">ADN</a>
    team or posting to the appropriate <a href="http://discussion.autodesk.com">discussion
