  body: 'Any chance you can explain more about the first example using the Toolkit
    to extract metadata.


    I started playing with the Toolkit yesterday and finally figured out the whole
    loading libraries in Visual Studio 05 and was able to get the samples running
    (some what) and I was able to get yours to work as well.


    I am not a C++ expert, but I''d really like to learn how the Toolkit works and
    learn some C++ along the way.  The Design Review API really doesn''t meet my needs,
    and I am hoping that the Toolkit will.


    One thing I am wondering is, does the toolkit actually allow me to display 3D
    graphics...or does it just read/write them.  If that is the case how would I go
    about building an application that uses the Toolkit but displays 3D graphics?


    I''d like to be able to build an application that is set-up similar to the "3D
    Collaborator" from InterKnowlogy.'

  body: 'Dustin,


    You really need to be a competent C++ programmer to have a hope of working with
    the DWF Toolkit: given the state of the documentation (which is light), it''s
    too a steep learning curve if you''re not completely comfortable with C++ already.


    The toolkit is just about accessing the contents of DWF files - there is no viewing
    component, although you might contact <a href="http://www.techsoft3d.com/">Tech
    Soft 3D</a> if you need a graphics library that is pre-integrated with the DWF
    Toolkit (their <a href="http://www.techsoft3d.com/products/3daf.html">HOOPS</a>
    technology compliments DWF nicely).

    Thanks for the response.


    I have been talking with Tech Soft 3D about their Hoops technology.  I was trying
    to see what the difference between what they were offering and the DWF toolkit...now
    I know!


    Do you know if the 3D Collaborator from InterKnowlogy is developed using Hoops?


    Guess I''ll start learning C++.


    Thanks again'

    at AU 2008 for embeding the DWF viewer into HTML.  You mentioned during class
    and in the hand out that you would post the full source HTML on your blog.  I
    found this from last year, but no HTML source.  Thanks

  body: 'Hi Kean, I''ve been searching on the internet for a way to add some properties
    to Object Instances (DWFDefinedObjectInstance) on DWF files but I haven''t been
    able to succeed. The DWF Toolkit samples don''t prove to be helpful because of
    my current scenario. This are the steps I''m following:


    1. Get the manifest through DWFPackageReader.getManifest().

    2. Iterate the sections with the manifest.getSections() and then get the Object
    Definition through section->getObjectDefinition().

    3. Once I get the Definition I then get the root instances using the def->getRootInstances(
    oRootInstances );.

    4. Once I get the root Instance I iterate the chiildren instances and try to add
    a new property to each Instance using: pInst->addProperty( DWFCORE_ALLOC_OBJECT(
    DWFProperty( L"name", L"value", L"category" ) ), true ).


    However no properties are added to any of the DWFDefinedObjectInstance. Is there
    any step I might be missing?


    Thanks in advance.'

    Have you tried posting to the relevant discussion group?
