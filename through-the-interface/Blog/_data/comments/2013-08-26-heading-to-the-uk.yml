  body: 'Kean, while you are in England please donate something to Coventry City FC.
    They need every penny and its the most worthwhile charity at the moment.

    Is it possible to get entity grip information (specifically grip location coords)
    via Interop?

    Enjoy the UK..'

  body: 'Hi Kevin,


    Thanks for asking an AutoCAD-related question in your comment - at first I was
    sure it was spam!


    Grip information generally isn''t exposed via COM. You might try asking via ADN
    or the discussion groups in case someone there has a suggestion for you.


    Regards,


    Kean'

  body: Kean, I am also desirous of a Morgan 3 wheeler, they look to be fantastic
    fun. The fact that you have been able to frame this as an “Autodesk Fact-Finding
    Mission” (AFFM) is a bonus; hopefully Carl doesn’t read your blog! Dale

  body: Kean, did you ever load a conventional Python script into AutoCAD, not IronPython?
    I'm trying to do this now using Python for .NET, it's a bit undermaintained but
    allows to keep Python C-extension libraries in your application.

  body: 'They are *fantastic* fun. Apparently they haven''t yet made it to Oz, which
    is a bit of the spanner in the works (for you, anyway).


    I hope Carl does read this blog! :-) For sure there''s a personal angle to this
    visit, but I do love a good win-win. ;-)

  body: 'I haven''t yet tried that: for sure you could call through to a separate
    executable running the script, but I''ve now managed to get my Python source working
    in standalone Python as well as IronPython (more on this soon, very soon). Having
    it directly inside IronPython means we''ll be able to provide more integrated
    feedback to the user (hopefully via a nice WPF UI - we''ll see).

    trying to present some neat use cases for Python+AutoCAD at the Russian AU in
