    I''m assuming/hoping I''ll be able to create a contextual state based on the value
    of an environment variable.'

    I did as described above. But i don''t see a new node named “Sample: Two circles

    Where is the error?'

    same as the DLL (just with the XAML extension) makes a difference, although that''s
    just a shot in the dark (as it''s been some time since I looked at this... I don''t
    know why I''m suggesting something that contradicts what I''ve written in this
    post, come to think of it).

  body: 'First of all, thanks for this great blog series.

    There are two things that crossed my mind:

    1. Besides Ribbon tabs, is it also possible to display groups, buttons or other
    Ribbon elements contextually? I guess not.

    2. The way to edit the general TabSelectorRules.xaml and placing the assembly
    next to it isn''t much comfortable. I recently watched the ADN DevCast Episode
    you posted about the AppAutoLoader and I''m excited about it. Wouldn''t it be
    great to have all customization files (assemblies, rule definitions, .cuix files
    and other resources) bundled together and provided via the apploader?'

  body: 'Hi Mostafa,


    That check really just guards to make sure we don''t de-reference a null pointer
    (or try to access a property on a null object - that sounds a bit more .NETy :-).
    We might also check the Status flag to only call the other function on OK, but
    ultimately that''s taken care of when we check the SelectionSet - if it''s null
    or doesn''t contain exactly two objects, we don''t go any further.

  body: 'Hi Kean,


    Hate to ping you at AU2012 but I''m trying to enable a palette and ribbon tab
    based on whether a selected entity has named XDATA with a specific value and this
    looks like a good starting point.  I''m hoping I can do this all from code.  Can''t
    we somehow package the XAML into a resource?


    Unfortunately, when I tried to grab the zip, this page came up...


    The page you''ve been trying to access was blocked.


    Reason: Active content was blocked due to digital signature violation. The violation
    is Missing Digital Signature.

    ... any ideas? Thanks,

    I''m now in San Rafael after AU, so no problem. :-)


    I''ve emailed the ZIP to you separately - let me know if you received it.


    I don''t know of a way to avoid the XAML requirement, unfortunately. I know it''s
    a pain to have to deploy in the Program Files foler, too, but that''s the requirement
    as it stands.
