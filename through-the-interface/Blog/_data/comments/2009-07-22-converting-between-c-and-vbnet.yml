    SharpDevelop (http://www.icsharpcode.net/OpenSource/SD/) used to have a C# <-->
    VB.Net conversion tool built into the last version I used, but I don''t know about
    the latest version.


    They have a converter online at http://codeconverter.sharpdevelop.net/SnippetConverter.aspx
    which does C#->VB.NET, C#->Boo, VB.NET->C#, VB.NET->Boo

  body: FYI - The developerFusion translator Kean quotes is based on the SharpDevelop
    source. They credit it on their webpage.

  body: "Hi Kean,\n\nI tried the converter by Kamal and the developer fusion one,\
    \ I found the latter to be much better. \n\nExample: Kamal's converter doesn't\
    \ take care of C# keyword 'as'. The developer fusion one, converts the 'as' keyword\
    \ in the equivalent form: Trycast()"

  body: 'Unfortunately this isn''t a place to request code conversions. I suggest
    trying one of the resources listed in this post, or asking your question via a
    forum somewhere (perhaps StackOverflow.com).


    Let me know if I''ve misunderstood your intent.
