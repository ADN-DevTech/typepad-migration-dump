  body: 'Hi Kevin,


    Great question - it''s one I tend to take for granted after all these years, so
    thought it best to look up the definition in the ObjectARX docs (.NET inherited
    the concept from there).


    Here''s what the ObjectARX Developer''s Guide says:


    "The AcEdJig class is used to perform drag sequences, usually to acquire, create,
    edit, and add a new entity to the database. If you are deriving a new entity class,
    you will usually want to implement your own version of AcEdJig. This class enables
    the AutoCAD user to define certain aspects of an entity using a pointing device,
    and it gives the programmer access to the AutoCAD drag mechanism. (The class takes
    its name from ''jig,'' a device used to hold a machine part that is being bent
    or molded in place.)"


    Let me know if you need any clarifications and I''ll attempt to put something
    in my own words.


    Regards,

  body: "Thank you for the information on \"Jigs\" Kean!\n\nOne final Beginner question,\
    \ if I may:\n\nWhen you refer to the \"Object ARX Developer's Guide\", do you\
    \ mean the documentation included in the ObjectARX SDK? \n\nIn the root directory\
    \ of the SDK, there is a sub directory named \"docs\" which contains a number\
    \ of .chm help files, one of which is arxdoc.chm. arxdoc contains a section titled\
    \ \"Object ARX Developer's Guide\". Is this the guide you are referring to? I\
    \ am using the .Net based \"wrapper\" classes to customize AutoCAD, and I just\
    \ want to be certain I have the most comprehensive documentation available. \n\
    \nI apologize if this is the wrong location to pose such a question, but I am\
    \ new to customizing AutoCAD and I find myself sightly confused about where to\
    \ locate AutoDesk's MSDN equivalent for this API. I am an ADN member, in case\
    \ this has any bearing on where to access the documentation you recommend.\n\n\
    Thanks again for the great blog."

    Yes, that''s exactly where I got it from.


    You may also want to check out the documentation resources linked from the AutoCAD
    Developer Center (<a href="http://autodesk.com/developautocad).">http://autodesk.com/developautocad).</a>
    You''ll find links to the online .NET Developer''s Guide as well as Visual Studio
    help integrations for .NET and ObjectARX. I use both regularly.


    Oh, and the ADN DevBlogs, of course (linked to from my blog''s left-sash).

  body: 'Hi Matthias,


    I tend to find it overkill to get string input within a jig, if I can avoid it
    (and so far I''ve done so pretty successfully ;-). I often get keyword input from
    within AcquirePoint() (for example), but that''s not the same thing.


    This post may be of some use, although I admit I haven''t spent much time on the
    string part of it:

    I can see why the framework wouldn''t help in this scenario. It''d certainly be
    interesting to see how it might be extended to work for "looped" phases... but
    yes - one for another day. :-)

    I''m afraid I don''t have time to provide support. Please post your question via
    the ADN team or to the AutoCAD .NET Discussion Group.


    As far as I''m aware there still isn''t a "drawing scale" in AutoCAD (unless someone
    slipped one in when I was napping :-). Which means you either have to store the
    user''s intention in your own code or infer it in some way.


    But again - someone on the forums will hopefully have some concrete advice for
    you.
