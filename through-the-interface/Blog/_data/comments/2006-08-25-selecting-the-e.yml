  body: 'I found your article while searching for info about nested entities.  I have
    a similar problem that has me puzzled.  I''m coding in VB.net using VS2005 and
    AutoCAD 2007.


    I have a 3dface inserted in a block and this block is inserted several times in
    other blocks.  I am trying to determine the objectID for the block insert of the
    3dface.  I can easily get the handle for the top level block or the handle for
    the 3dface but the Xdata I''m looking for is in the block insert of the 3dface.  I
    can even get the handle of the 3dface block but I don''t know how to get the objectID
    for the inserted 3dface block I picked in the graphics window.


    Any help would be greatly appreciated as I can find very little help for vb.net
    and the AutoCAD API.  Thnak you.'

    Try looking into AcEdSolidSubentitySelector::selectFaces().


    I haven''t used it myself, but it should do what you want (from ObjectARX).
