    kidding, its strikingly similar to C#, as if...on purpose?

    How did MS get away with making a language that seems to have copied Java?'

  body: 'while here, it seems to me that Autodesk should use the java introduction
    to also re-embrace Autolisp.

    Most of the customization floating around is lisp, and its easy for a general
    cad manager to use for startup (acaddoc.lsp) and several other things, without
    climbing the .net mountain.

    I am thinking of VLIDE improvements, there are super basic mods needed that would
    not affect the actual syntax at all. Things like the ability to compile multiple
    projects batch style, and also not showing the console window every time debugging
    is stopped. It is a golden opportunity as you want people buying autocad, not
    acad lt, or bricscad. How much time was spent on this java addition? doubt it
    affects as many customers as lisp does.'

    a syntax perspective), so they''ll inevitably look quite similar.


    Please do submit your requests for feature enhancements via the ADN team (or there''s
    probably a discussion forum for that, too).


    We needed this layer (or something like it) to implement the Design Feed: I see
    it as a good thing that it was also made available externally.


    You''ll see much more benefit when you''re able to write an app that works across
    multiple platforms - desktop, web & mobile - which would have been very hard to
    do with LISP: each of these platforms has JavaScript built into it, as they all
    provide web access.

    When/whether it gets done is another question, of course.

    JavaScript programming on AutoCAD 2014 is very interesting. I already built a
    new technology preview called .NETScript that can drive AutoCAD (not only for
    2014) locally and remotely. JavaScript uses .js files while .NETScript uses .ns
    files that can both load from the web and execute inside AutoCAD. The API will
    be different between them. Please check it out at www.netscriptcad.com


    Thank you.'

    You can use acedSetVar() from ObjectARX to do this, or you might write to the
    keys in "HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Autodesk\AutoCAD\R19.1\ACAD-D001:409\Profiles\<<Unnamed
    Profile>>\Variables", if you really needed to.


    For the domains, you might want to pick up the default value from here, to make
    sure you don''t break anything by removing existing domains from the list: "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Autodesk\AutoCAD\R19.1\ACAD-D001\Variables\TRUSTEDDOMAINS".


    The best, of course, is to use Autoloader to avoid all of this.

    Downloading .js files is freaking-out my scanners. I''m probably not alone in
    this. I imagine there will be more samples, perhaps a different extension will
    solve this issue; either zipped, or append a .txt to the .js.


    Though I s''pose it''s just as easy for us to do a SaveAs and add the extension
    .js.txt :)


    I''ll be interested in seeing where this addition leads.

    Exactly - and if you can''t "save as", you should be able to take the code from
    the blog post and save it into a local file of your choosing. I could change the
    extension of the file on my blog, but that woould stop it from being loadable
    for those who don''t have such files blocked.


    Agreed - will be interesting to see what comes of this.


    Cheers,

    I didn''t mean to downplay the importance of LISP: I''m just saying we couldn''t
    easily have used LISP to achieve what we want from this particular mechanism.

    I guess the Autoloader is really the best option, as mentioned at this video from
    AutoDesk: <a href="http://goo.gl/QcIjU">http://goo.gl/QcIjU</a>


    Use the acedSetVar() is also a interesting one, but it is an overload (for the
    programmers and for the plugin).


    Use the registry entry inside the installer is, in my option, the worst one, as
    it needs to be set for each profile.


    One more time, thank you!'

    Thank you for sharing so much useful codes.

    Inspired by your article about LeapJS and Paper.js, I am trying to use D3.js (<a
    href="http://d3js.org/)">http://d3js.org/)</a> to solve points Delaunay problem
    recently.

    But I find that after I use this to obtain the object as you illustrated in this
    article.


    var entity = new Acad.DBEntity(z.objectId);

    // var ext = entity.getExtents();


    I find that except getExtents, I cant find entity''s any other properties, just
    like the center of a circle. When I read a article of you, you say that "Given
    the fact the JavaScript API doesn''t provide access to AutoCAD drawing objects
    – and there are currently no plans to provide this access"


    Is this means that I have to use getExtents to get a Point''s position? or could
    you please recommend other ways? I really want to use web library to solve this
    problem, that is what Javascript API attract me.


    Thank you very much.'
