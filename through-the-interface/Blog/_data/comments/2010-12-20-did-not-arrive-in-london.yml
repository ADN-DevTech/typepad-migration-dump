  body: 'Hi Kean,

    I know what I am going to say has nothing to do with weather or airlines, but
    what can I do, I have a very interesting project in my mind and I was stuck on
    step one. For this I urgently need your help, I managed to get ACA 2011 working
    with VS 2010 Express (thanks to Jeremy''s valuable posts), and started working
    on ACA.NET after watching your 2 web-casts. I am facing a problem with the Graph
    class when running AecWallSystemSampleMgd sample shipped with ACA 2011(see code
    below)


    Manager mgr = new Manager(db);

    Graph theGraph = mgr.FindGraph(wall);


    I am always getting null value for theGraph object, when I debug the mgr.GraphCount
    is always 0.


    I need the wall Joints,Sections and Connections to develop automatic details generation
    of ICF system.


    Any help in this regard will be highly appreciated and also if you have any resource
    regarding ICF wall system in ACA would be very helpful.


    Enjoy your flight!!'

    I have forgotten nearly everything I once knew about ACA (it has been 10 years
    ago since I worked with it).


    Please submit your question to ADN or to the relevant online discussion forum.


    Regards,

    sad, that you didn''t made it to London. But getting more time with you family
    isn''t bad either, isn''t it?


    I just wanted to say thank you for everything I learned from you, be it coding
    Acad-Net or playing pool like last week in Munich. Your comments and suggestions
    on the DevLab really helped me a lot.


    I wish a Merry Christmas and a very happy New Year!


    Please, keep up your work!

    Regards

    René Andreas'

  body: 'Hi René,


    You''re quite right (and me being stuck in the UK for Christmas would not have
    been popular with my family, either :-).


    It was a pleasure to meet you in Munich!


    Check today''s post for a tip you''ll find of use (around the use of Win32''s
    SetFocus() to avoid that mouse click).


    All the best to you and your family for the festive season,


    Kean
