    The acdbmgd.dll assembly (which is only part of what you want, I expect), is available
    as part of RealDWG (http://www.autodesk.com/realdwg).


    To implement a DWG viewer from scratch would take a lot of work - I suggest looking
    at DWG TrueView (which can be embedded as an ActiveX control in a WinForm).

    i am just new to this civil3d, and find it convenient to use than in my accustomed
    Land Dev''t, i was planning to shift but then i found out that the DaylightBench
    Sub-assemblies has its limited user inputs in benching, if i just can modify its
    user inputs and separating

    Cut from Fill Benching controls....

    is it possible to modify the default inputs?

    or do i have to make a new one?


    i have been researching about this Vb.net programming but i guess i need help
    regarding this one. your tip is highly much appreciated.

    I just had one of my users point out a problem, which used to work fine, but I
    recently migrated it to Managed code, from COM, and we have only been on 2009
    for a short time, so I''m not sure which is the problem.  The old com code did
    basically what this post does, except it assigned a block reference to the annotation
    property along with assigning a special arrow.  Now the Managed code I have looks
    an awful lot like the code above, but replace the Mtext with a Block.  It errors
    saying eNotApplicable when I try to set the Annotation to the Blockref''s ID.  Any
    Ideas?'

    No idea - this is the sort of question I''d typically suggest asking of the ADN
    team (I don''t have time to research issues that are even slightly off-topic,
    at the moment).


    You might consider joining - it seems like it would be of use to you.

  body: 'Hi Greg,


    The default arrowhead doesn''t use a block definition, by all accounts, so that''s
    why looking for it in the block table is failing.


    If you want the default (i.e. closed, filled) arrowhead, you may have to set DIMBLK
    to "" before creating and adding the MLeader to the database (resetting DIMBLK
    afterwards). At least that''s what I''d expect to work.


    Cheers.

    There is one little problem - I''m passing "" or "." (both works) to DIMBLK. And
    this is OK for new drawing.


    But if I open some older file, where I have few dimensions styles, it takes the
    default symbol for the leader from current dimension style.


    i.e -> I have two styles (Scale 100, Scale 50).

    Scale 100 has leader = closed filled.

    Scale 50 has leader = oblique.


    If I have Scale 100 as current, the mleader function works great. If I change
    it to Scale 50, I''m getting mleader with oblique arrow.


    It seems, that acadApp.SetSystemVariable("DIMBLK", "."); doesn''t work then.'

    I''m sorry - I don''t quite understand your question. But if what you want to

    (and conversely, if it can''t then it probably can''t).
