  body: "Hi Kean\nI'm trying to get the DreamCheeky LED message board working from\

    I didn''t hit this particular issue, but then I''ve only built it on Arch Linux
    ARM, not on Raspbian.


    Good luck with fixing it,

  body: 'i know it''s been a while since you posted, but if you edit lshid.c in your
    libhid/test folder, around line 41, comment out the <i>len = *</i> bit, and add
    those under:

    <b>len = len;</b>

    <b>custom = custom;</b>


    and it should compile fine. im having lots of errors too, but i did manage to
    make libhid... dcled doesnt want to compile though..
