    I''ve been using animated view transitions in the pans and zooms that some of
    my apps do for quite some time.


    I use the undocumented AcMdgViewTransitionServices class from acmdginternal.dll
    to temporarily enable animated view transitions if they''re not curently enabled
    for scripts, and then just P/Invoke acedCmd() to run the ZOOM command, which of
    course, makes no noise (with CMDECHO set to 0).


    I have yet to see a good case for why we should avoid the use of acedCmd() from
    the document context to entirely avoid the kinds of problems your code solves
    using NOMOTT.'

    I''ve actually realised that sending a few escape chars should reduce (probably
    remove) the risk of NOMUTT remaining set. I need to give it a try, but that seems
    pretty solid.


    Ultimately it''s all down to choice, of course. I''d tend to stick to supported
    (and ideally managed) APIs, where possible, all else being equal.


    Cheers,

    a more general question:

    How can I obtain an object which the user selected before entering the command
    ?

  body: 'Hi Kean,


    thanks for your tip. I still needed a second try to get it working, because I
    overlooked the CommandFlags.UsePickSet flag.

    Readers might interest that specifying CommandFlags.Redraw leaves the selection
    intact after execution of the usercommand, if you omit it, the selection is cleared.


    Instead of using some more natural term as SelectedObject AUTOCAD developers chose
    SelectImplied which is as arcane as the whole object model. Even simple things
    turn out to need an unnecessary complicate solution.

    Really annoying is, that there is no (good) documentation on all that stuff.

    Autodesk should take care of this instead of producing videos like "10 easy ways
    to crash your Autocad".


    But fortunately we have you Kean :) Your blog turned out to be the most valuable
    source for information regarding the .NET interface.


    Keep on and thanks again

    Perhaps, but I don''t regard acedCommand() as an unsupported API and ultimately,
    most of the managed APIs we use are just wrappers that delegate to native code
    anyway :)


    Couple that with the various other problems many have with SendStringToExecute''s
    asynchronous nature and the fact that it can only accept string input, is what
    makes acedCommand() a much more robust solution, from my perspective.'

  body: 'I wasn''t actually referring to acedCommand() -  I was more talking about
    the use of acmdginternal.dll being unsupported, although that was only a side
    point.


    That said, acedCommand() is indeed not supported from .NET. Yes, our managed wrappers
    call through to unmanaged APIs internally, but you''ll notice we haven''t wrapped
    acedCommand(). We support people driving commands by sending them via the command-throat
    (SendStringToExecute() or COM''s SendCommand()).


    I''m not saying you shouldn''t do what you''re doing, Tony, I''m just sharing
    a different perspective: while you may consider it less clean to pump commands,
    from an AutoCAD internals perspective it''s actually considered best practice
    (it removes the possibility of exceeding levels of re-entrancy, for instance and
    is slightly more future-proof: Microsoft''s threat to deprecate fibers will probably
    impact acedCommand() in some way, at least that''s my understanding).


    A big problem I''ve realised with the above post is related to Undo, but there''ll
    be a post going live on Monday to show a slightly different approach to address
    that.
