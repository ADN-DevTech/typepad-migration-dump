  body: 'Kean, at what point will the functionality of the hotfix become part of CORE
    AutoCAD?


    Can you post a table of some sort describing the state of this functionality in
    2013 and 2014 including each version patched with the various SP''s available.


    I do not have a good handle on which version(s) are equipped with what, or if
    every version currently out needs the HotFix.


    Thanks!'

    As you know I can''t make predictions about the future when it comes to product
    releases.


    It''s worth bearing in mind that the Hotfix actually has two things: it has a
    modified .DBX to stop the problem from propagating plus it has a clean-up tool
    that allows you to purge DGN linestyles when you have unwanted ones.


    My piece was obviously on the clean-up side of things, but I''d guess you''re
    talking more about the .DBX change (as the clean-up tools isn''t really product
    specific: it''s easy to take the code and get it working on old versions, too).


    I think AutoCAD 2014 SP 1 probably has the .DBX fix, judging from <a href="http://images.autodesk.com/adsk/files/AutoCAD_2014_and_AutoCAD_LT_2014_SP1_Enu.htm">the
    readme</a>, but it doesn''t have the clean-up tool.


    Regards,


    Kean'

    Thanks for your comments and continued support on this!'
