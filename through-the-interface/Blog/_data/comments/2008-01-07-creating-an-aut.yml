    I only see that you can enable the frame - I don''t see what controls its distance
    from the text. I''d suggest posting something on the discussion groups - I''m
    sure someone there will be able to help.


    Here are some multi-leader posts, by the way:

    \ been following your posts and they are helping me a lot, especially that I am\
    \ a new .NET AutoCAD developer. \n\nMy Question: \n\nI am creating new layerRecords\
    \ and I would like to set the linetypes based on the definitions set in the acadeiso.lin\
    \ file. Since this file can be loaded from AutoCAD I believe I do not need to\
    \ re-create any linetype defined inside it. Is there a way to specify the linetype\
    \ from the acadeiso.lin file without recreating it? \n\nBest Regards,"

  body: 'Hi Ravi,


    I suggest creating a command that reads the information in from a file (using
    System.IO) and then creates corresponding geometry in the model/paperspace of
    the current drawing. You can then either save out the current drawing programmatically
    or rely on the SAVE command to do so.


    If you search this blog for "AppendEntity" you should find plenty of examples
    of creating geometry inside an AutoCAd drawing.

    Sorry - I don''t know, off the top of my head.


    I suggest posting your question to the ADN team or on the AutoCAD .NET Discussion
