  body: WOW looked at data binding with WPF, Talk about overly complicated! They better
    get better tools for WPF and data binding.

  body: "I've been trying to rewrite this and the part 1 version in VB.net to no avail.\
    \ I suspect there is a casting issue. When I try to cast the AcSmSheet.GetSheetViews\
    \ into a IAcSmEnumComponent things go pear shaped, and nothing gets past. My tree\
    \ has the sheet set with its subsets and no sheets.\n\nI've also tried to use\
    \ C# but I can't get rid of the red line under UserControl1 and TreeNode.\n\n\
    The short of what I'm trying to do is pull out all the information from the DST\
    \ into something a little easier to navigate... do stuff to it... then put it\
    \ back. Sounds easy as its just a whole bunch of text, but its turning out to\
    \ be quite a task. \n\nI'm happy to post code/more information."

  body: 'Have you tried <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2009/07/converting-between-c-and-vbnet.html">an
    automated conversion tool</a>? I know these don''t always provide perfect results,
    but they are usually of some help.


    I don''t see where the results of GetSheetViews() is cast to IAcSmEnumComponent,
    above: it gets passes to ProcessItem() which expects an IAcSmPersist object.


    If the problem goes beyond a flat port of the above code, then I suggest contacting
    ADN or posting to the discussion group (as it''s a bit beyond the scope of the
    help I can provide).
