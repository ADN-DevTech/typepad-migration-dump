  body: 'Hi Kean,


    I am also thinking of taking the jump to Visual Studio 2008, because of the new
    F# CTP release. Last time I tried using VS 2008 to compile some AutoCAD .NET plug-in,
    I would get an annoying warning when I loaded into AutoCAD. In any case, I''ll
    experience soon if that''s still the case now.'

  body: 'Hi Kean,


    To be more precise, the error message popping up is for C++ AutoCAD projects compiled
    in VS 2008. It says: "AutoCAD is attempting to load ... which is not compatible
    with AutoCAD. Do you still want to load the application?"


    Do you know how I can get rid of this warning?


    Thanks.'

  body: I found a solution. It's a build tool version problem, which can be fixed
    by using the utility the VC Build Hook utility freely available at http://www.manusoft.com/Resources/ARXTips/Index.stm#VC8ForARX2000

  body: 'This is how it should be: unmanaged ObjectARX modules need to be compiled
    with the same compiler as AutoCAD, which means VS .NET 2002 for AutoCAD 2004-2006
    and VS 2005 for AutoCAD 2007-2009.


    So you will need to downgrade to build applications for these releases.


    If you want to use VS 2008 to build applications for these versions, you can always
    use the managed API.

  body: 'Just to add to your comment, Kean. VS2008 works fine for writing managed,
    COM and mixed managed/COM addins for ''06 thru ''09. For ''06 to ''08, you need
    to go into the compile options and set the targeted framework to use.

    Ps - see you @ AU!'

    the Visual Studio Shell with f#. It becomes the equivalent of a  free version
