  body: 'Kean, welcome to Mac world! :)


    Some quick tips:


    -Hope you did get 8Gb of RAM (it is very useful for running Parallels with dedicated
    4Gb RAM);


    -Parallels 6 runs gracefully Windows 7 x32 and x64 with 4Gb RAM. I use both AutoCAD
    2011 and Revit 2011 with acceptable performance;


    -You will need HD space for sure. I recommend the brand new Seagate Momentus 2.5"
    XT which is a hybrid HD. It is really fast and a 500Gb model costs around $140
    (compatible with all MacBooks);


    -An external large HD is also recommended to spare testing Parallels virtual machines
    so you can build specific scenarios for testing purposes;


    -Office: Thanks god, a new version with Outlook (and Office) is coming out next
    month. Current version with Entourage is not fancy and native Mac OSX Mail app
    is too limited. The 2011 version comes with a totally Cocoa developed Outlook
    version which seems pretty cool.


    -Browser: Safari is ok but you may also use Firefox for more custom demand websites
    (no big deal here);


    -Blu-ray: Macs does not support Blu-ray units yet but an external unit works fine
    with custom burning software and for watching movies (supposing you need BR discs);


    -Programing: Xode 3.2 is ok but version 4 is even better with a more simple and
    integrated IDE. Hopefully it will be 100% compatible with AutoCAD Mac ObjectARX;


    -Source control: Mac does not have a Tortoise SVN client equivalent but XCode
    has a native support (yet limited) to SVN clients. It may work for not complex
    scenarios.


    Ok, this is what I remember so far. Of course simple apps like Skype, Messenger,
    etc have their own Mac versions.


    Good luck!!!'

  body: 'One more thing...

    If you create partitions you won''t be able to use Bootcamp as its tools does
    not accept more than one existing partition (it creates the second exclusively
    for Bootcamp).


    There are some hacks but they are always dangerous.


    Further, by using Parallels, your capability of run more systems without reboot
    is pretty cool. Other feature I really like is the Snapshot because you can use
    it to reverse any tests you want to run again.
