  body: "Hi Kean, \nGood topic.\nI translated this into VB, and had a conundrum on\
    \ this part:\n\ntd.Callback = delegate(\n      ActiveTaskDialog atd,\n      TaskDialogEventArgs\
    \ e,\n      object sender\n      )....\nso I pulled it out to it's own function\
    \ and did this:\ntd.Callback = AddressOf tdCallBack\n\nwhich does seem to be catching\
    \ the callbacks, but it threw an error on \"atd.SetProgressBarState(Autodesk.Windows.ProgressBarState.Normal)\"\
    \nand ultimately crashed AutoCAD after a second error that occured after the callback.\
    \  I commented out that line and it seems to work fine.\nthe error was System.NotSupportedException\
    \ \n  Message=\"Specified method is not supported.\"\n  Source=\"AdWindows\"\n\
    and came with a stack trace 52 calls long."

  body: 'Hi David,


    Strange - not sure why it would be different in your version... I don''t remember
    especially why I put the SetProgressBarState() call in there, so it could possibly
    be redundant or even erroneous (although I didn''t see a crash).

    I received the same error as David on the same line.


    The crash manifests when you hit the checkbox at the bottom of the dialog.

    OK - you have me convinced. :-)


    For some reason it works fine on my (Vista) machine, but I can see no reason for
    the call being there & removing it does nothing to the behaviour. I suspect it''s
    just an artifact from me testing out the various properties/methods.


    So I''ve removed it from the post. Thanks for the report & confirmation!

  body: Glenn did not mention his OS but I am on ACAD2009, VB pro 2005, .NET 2, and
    XP pro.  Just for giggles I looked at the link above to the Microsoft implementation,
    and it says the required version is Vista, so that's probably it.

  body: 'Autodesk''s implementation was independent - I''m assuming to support XP
    as well as Vista. So that''s not going to be the problem.


    The call doesn''t need to be made there, so it''s safe to ignore the problem (I
    expect calling it on TaskDialog rather than ActiveTaskDialog works just fine).

  body: 'Hi Thomas,


    I would start directly with VB.NET: Microsoft is putting everything behind their
    .NET technology and VBA isn''t really supported by them anymore (there''s no native
    64-bit version of VBA, for instance).


    So go directly with VB.NET (or C#), using either standard Visual Studio or Visual
    Basic (C#) Express.


    I would (of course :-) recommend using this blog as a resource, and you can post
    your questions to <a href="http://discussion.autodesk.com/forums/forum.jspa?forumID=152">the
    AutoCAD .NET Discussion Group</a>. If your company is serious about helping your
    customization work, they might also invest in an <a href="http://www.autodesk.com/joinadn">ADN
