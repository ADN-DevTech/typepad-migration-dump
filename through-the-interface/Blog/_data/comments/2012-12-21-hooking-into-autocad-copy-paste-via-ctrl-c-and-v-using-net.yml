    We are having a problem related to paste clipboard. We are extracting block attribute
    to MS access file using VB.net.

    While extracting block data, all block object in paste clipboard is also exported
    to MS access file. Kindly guide to clear paste clip board using VB.net before
    executing block attribute data. We want to extract block object existing in drawing
    only.'
