  body: "Hi Kean,\n\nThis is Jaime here, great job with your blog, and for the reply\
    \ on my email good to know that the name was enough, Quick question about the\
    \ SVS example, I've been trying to use this by calling the function on a separate\
    \ action, meaning that this function becomes part of the process of all my actions\
    \ that take place when i call my app. The problem is that I'm getting a crash\
    \ when it reaches the line : \n\nViewportTableRecord vtr =\n\n          (ViewportTableRecord)tr.GetObject(\n\
    \n            vt[\"*Active\"], OpenMode.ForWrite\n\n          );\n\nAnd i think\
    \ the reason could be because, I'm clicking an Icon which could set the viewport\
    \ to something different than \"*Active\".\n\nAny Idea on this ? thank you so\
    \ much for your help take care and hope to see you again soon.\n\nBest,\nJaime"

    :-)


    Try checking whether vt contains "*Active" before the GetObject() call: if it
    doesn''t there may be some other way to get the viewport you want (perhaps via
    the CVPORT variable? This is just off the top of my head, mind).


    Cheers,

    Anyone using these just needs to be aware that they''re not part of the officially
    supported API, of course.

  body: Would it be possible to make text objects printable in paper space viewports
    having the "Conceptual" visual style? To print text in such viewports we need
    to overlap two viewports one with the 2D visual style and the other with the Conceptual
    style, wich is rather tedious...

  body: 'Hi Patrick,


    This sounds like a product issue (one that''s not really in my area of expertise).
    I suggest posting it either via ADN or the appropriate online discussion forum.
