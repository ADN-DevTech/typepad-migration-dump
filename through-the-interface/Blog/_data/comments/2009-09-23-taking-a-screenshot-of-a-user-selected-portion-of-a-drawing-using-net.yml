    I''ll update the post.


    Thanks so much, Paavo!

    You''ve probably got a using statement to System.Windows or something like that.
    You may need to change your variable declarations from Point to include the appropriate
    namespace.

    Much appreciate all your help to the community. I am fairly new to the ACAD .NET
    side of things and i''m having a hard time figuring out monitor (mouse) pixel
    X/Y from the MDI screen pixel X/Y returned by PointToScreen. The PointToScreen
    gives me the pixels of a world coordinate relative to the MDI extents, i need
    to get the monitor  (mouse) pixels instead. This is related to a CodedUI app we
    are using which captures the monitor (mouse) X/Y associated with each click and
    records it in a test script. This is problematic since it makes script playback
    dependent on the same exact screen resolution/layout etc. as used during the recording.
    Hence we are developing a WCF adaptor which will take the recorded monitor (mouse)
    X/Y and translate them to the active view model X/Y/Z coordinates. The model coordinates
    are then stored in the test script instead of the monitor (mouse) X/Y. The reverse
    transformation is performed during script replay (e.g. WCF adaptor gets the 3D
    model coordinates and returns the associated mouse X/Y location to be clicked
    by the script). This will make the script independent of screen resolution/layout/etc.'

    Have you tried the ClientToScreen() P/Invoke, as shown in the post?


    If that doesn''t help, I''d recommend contacting ADN (for a project like this
    you should really apply for membership if you haven''t already got it) or posting
    your question to the AutoCAD .NET Discussion Group.


    Best regards,
