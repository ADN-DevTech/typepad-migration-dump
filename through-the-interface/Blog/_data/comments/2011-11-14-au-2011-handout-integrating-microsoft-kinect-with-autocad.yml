    This is really fascinating stuff.


    I can''t seem to find the drawing file ''Kinect.dwg'' you mention, was it published
    from before?

    Yes, it is fun. :-)


    The class materials should be available on AU Online, but I''ve sent the current
    state of the samples and the Kinect.dwg file to you by email.

  body: 'Thanks Kean, the sample didn''t work at 1st, a missing dwg would be the cause
    didn''t make any sense.

    Tried the Kinect SDK samples - depth view appeared ok, but skeletal didn''t.


    Downloaded DirectX runtime and sdk, rebuilt the solution - works great!

    COOL!


    Thanks again and good luck at AU!'

  body: "<b>Hey Kean</b> <br />\nThank you for your nice tutorial on interfacing AutoCAD\
    \ + Kinect, indeed, however I have to mention <br /> that with current Kinect\
    \ SDK, your settings will not work,\n<br /> please see below my findings:<br /><br\
    \ />\nIf you download the current version of Kinect SDK 1.6 which is associated\
    \ with .NET Framework 4.0 even SDK versions 1.0 and 1.5, <br />\ntherefore your\
    \ code must be tweaked or changed since the <b>Microsft.Research.Kinect</b>\n\
    has been removed from these newest versions of .NET. <br /><br />\nIn addition\
    \ there is an issue with AutocAD compatibility version, let’s say if you have\
    \ AutoCAD 2010 or 2011 which run on the .NET Framework 3.5, \ntherefore by default\
    \  your approach will not work under current Kinect SDK’s, here are my settings:\n\
    <ul>\n<li>Autocad 2012 including Autocad Arquitect 2012</li>\n<li>Microsoft Visual\
    \ Studio 2010(Build the project ensuring the platform target, let’s say x64 for\
    \ 64 bit Windows 7) and target framework 4.0</li>\n<li>Kinect for Windows SDK\
    \ beta version( excluding later versions)</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<br />\n\n<p>Hopefully,\
    \ it helps</p>"

    A lot has changed since this post.


    Have you looked at some of the more recent Kinect-related posts, such as this
    one?
