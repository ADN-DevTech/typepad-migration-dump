  body: 'Maybe you could orbit the jigged point-cloud using your own hand gestures
    when with a different gesture pick the point. With that the whole process can
    be done away from the AutoCAD UI which would allow you to capture your clouds
    alone.


    It is getting interesting...


    What about splitting the AutoCAD screen into 2 viewports and have each of them
    orbited by your hands (right and left)? Imagine this when someone is evaluating
    a 3D model...that would be great!


    Anyway, just trying to push your mind... :)

  body: 'Yes, I agree.


    Do you think a partially opened hand (like when you are replacing a burned bulb)
    would be a good gizmo for Kinect to identify the Orbit command?


    In this case the fingers could be used to identify the directions (vectors) and
    then used to determine the orbit movement (direction, angle, etc).


    Just a hunch.'

  body: 'Hi Guillermo,


    Very cool! I see KinectSensor has been updated to support OpenNI 1.1.0.39 (unstable),
    which is very good news.


    I''ll see if I can get nKinect working with these versions and post a quick update.


    Thanks!

    A friend of mine is thinking along similar lines, but with a CNC machine rather
    than a 3D printer.


    Thanks for sharing!
