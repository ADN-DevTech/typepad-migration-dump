  body: 'Hello neyton,


    Sorry - I don''t personally work with the Civil 3D API (and I don''t have time
    to provide support via this blog).


    I suggest you cross post your question to the <a href="http://discussion.autodesk.com/forums/forum.jspa?forumID=190">AutoCAD
    Civil 3D Customization Discussion Group</a> or to the <a href="http://adn.autodesk.com">ADN</a>
    team, if you''re a member.

  body: 'Hi Kean,


    I''m about to migrate my application from ObjectARX 2000 to 2010. Yes, it''s tough
    taks I think. I know there is a long road ahead. Could you please give some hints
    (or point some documentation) that will help to accomplish this task.


    I saw at the ADN website a "Porting ObjectARX Applications" webcast but I couldn''t
    find the video download location. Do you know where I can download it.


    Thanks in advance.


    Plais.'

    See my reply to your previous comment <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2006/07/migrating_code_.html">here</a>.


    You may actually be looking for <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2007/02/autocad_2008_64.html">this
    post</a>, which was specific to 64-bit migration.


    You might also submit your question via the ADN site, so an expert from my team
    can handle it.


    Regards,


    Kean
