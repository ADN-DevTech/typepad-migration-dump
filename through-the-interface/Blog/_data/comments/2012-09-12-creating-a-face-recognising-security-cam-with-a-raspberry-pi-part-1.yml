    \ kind of data is going to go into the face data XML file. I would not put pixel\
    \ data there, but store that in external individual image files, and reference\
    \ those. \n\nSome of my friends boycott internet-based social networking and thus\
    \ hopefully cannot be identified by facebook, so I would enable private non-facebook\
    \ photos from the local system to be used as well.\n\nCheers, Jeremy."

  body: 'Hi Jeremy,


    We''ll of course talk about the XML format (although it''s something this project
    has inherited), which uses an algorithm called Eigenfaces to greatly reduce the
    amount of data stored.


    And yes - I''m probably not even going to share the Facebook-specific code (for
    once), but will certainly explain more about the file/folder structure you''d
    need to build to train the database in some other way.


    Cheers,

  body: 'Hi Kean,


    This looks really interesting!


    An API I''m not familiar with (but which I believe might prove useful here) is
    the Google Picasa Web API; As I say, I only know there exists an API from Google
    which (in some way) ties in with the Picasa Web offering from the big G.


    In case you aren''t aware, Picasa (the desktop application) offers you the ability
    to tag faces of the people it finds within your picture library, and will (with
    your permission) sync them to your Picasa Web Photos albums. I''ve tagged all
    my family with it, so if it''s possible to use this API instead of Facebook, that
    might be another avenue that would likely get around the friends-not-tagged-on-Facebook
    issue that Jeremy mentions.


    Here is the best link I could find that will be of help:


    <a href="http://www.klick.com/health/news/blog/retrieving-face-tag-data-from-the-picasa-web-api/">Retrieving
    face tag data from the Picasa Web API</a> (which in turn links to this page: <a
    href="https://code.google.com/p/gdata-issues/issues/detail?id=751&sort=-stars%20id&colspec=API%20ID%20Type%20Priority%20Stars%20Summary">Google
    Groups Picasa issues page</a>


    Cheers,


    Alex.'

  body: 'Hi Alex,


    That''s interesting... it should certainly be possible to swap out the Facebook-oriented
    piece to pull down data from Picasa.


    I''ll be describing the process I''ve used to isolate and extract faces to train
    the database next week.

    I''m pretty much done with that side of things, but I''ll certainly revisit the
    code once I''ve looked at the tutorial more closely.

  body: 'Hi Kean, hope you are still following this thread. I''m wondering whether
    to start a face recognition project. My concept would be based on linkedin profile
    pics, thus only 1 reference pic per face.


    Based on your experience is recognizing a face with only one reference pic available
    from a photo by any chance possible? Did you encounter in your experiment cases
    where the user had only one pic in fb?'

  body: 'Hi Pyryl,


    Based on my experience the problems would be:


    * 1 photo is way too few, at least for the system I tried to use.

    * Profile photos aren''t representative enough of how people look when they come
    to your door (or sit at their PC, if somehow recognising people''s faces via their
    webcam).


    Cheers,
