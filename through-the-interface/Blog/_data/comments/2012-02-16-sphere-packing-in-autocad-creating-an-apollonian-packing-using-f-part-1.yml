    Frankly I''m still not sure of the applicability even for 3D printing, let alone
    some other domain! :-)


    But I''d hope the code (particularly what''s coming next week) will be of use
    to someone out there.


    And if you think this looks stunning, just wait for Monday''s post... :-D
