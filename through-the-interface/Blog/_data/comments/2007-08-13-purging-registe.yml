  body: Hey, thanks for hitting this subject Kean!  If there is any chance you could
    comment on the possibility/difficulty of stopping reg apps in xrefs from "sticking"
    in drawings they are xreffed to, that would be appreciated.  No worries if you
    cannot get to it, you already did a huge favor by these posts!

  body: 'Hi James,


    I can see a few ways to go about this:


    <ul>

    <li>Respond to events telling you when an xref is created - from here you can
    fire off the PC command to purge the current drawing (probably using SendStringToExecute()):</li>

    <ul>

    <li>the Editor.CommandEnded event for the XATTACH command</li>

    <li>the Database.ObjectAppended event for a block reference corresponding to an
    xref</li>

    </ul>

    <li>As a matter of course run the PC command (or the code it uses) just before
    a drawing is saved:</li>

    <ul>

    <li>redefine the QSAVE and SAVE commands to call PC first</li>

    <li>use the Database.BeginSave event (assuming that''s not too late - this would
    need testing) to run the code from there</li>

    </ul>

    </ul>


    I''m sure there are options I''ve missed, but these are some of the different
    ways you might investigate automating this activity.


    Cheers,

    I need to purge and Audit a set of autocad files by batch processing them and
    without opening the files.


    Above is the way to purge the files.

    how can I Audit a batch of autocad files?


    I am using db.Audit() which accepts AutitInfo as parameter. But I am not able
    to set the AuditInfo parameter or to define it.


    Please advise.'

    Sorry - firstly I don''t really understand what you''re asking, and secondly I
    don''t have time to provide support that''s unrelated to my posts (unless this
    is actually a suggestion for a blog post, which I unfortunately can''t commit
    to addressing).


    I suggest posting your question to one of our online discussion groups.
