  body: 'this sparked a thought I have been wondering about. You use xdata here, but
    I have apps that need to attach too much data and must use xrecords.

    I noticed a wblock of a lwpolyline loses this data, while a wblock (to another
    drawing) keeps it.

    This is a bit of a problem for me because my prog has the option to display the
    pline as 2d or 3d, depending on the situation (plan sheets or DTM surface modeling...)

    Do you agree on this conclusion? I would love to discover I am just doing it wrong.
    I''ll post code of do a DG post if its not an issue of "everyone knows wblock
    of lwpline drops xrecord data..." thx'

  body: 'It should work fine with XRecords - that''s just overkill for this particular
    scenario.


    The only issue I recall wrt Polylines and XData is when developers used to store
    XData per vertex, which clearly doesn''t map to lightweight polylines.


    If there''s an issue with WBLOCK and Polylines, please do make sure it''s submitted
    via ADN.

  body: Thanks Kean. This will help out a lot. I'm assuming that SetXdataFilter is
    an AutoCAD .net function. I don't see this function in ObjectARX. I guess I'll
    just use the isApplicable() virtual to determine if it's one to process.

  body: 'Hi Joe,


    Thank you for asking the question at AU! :-)


    Yes, SetXDataFilter is a convenience that''s available in .NET: in ObjectARX you''ll
    have to do a bit more work within isApplicable(), but it should be simple enough
    to put together.


    All the best to you and yours for the holiday season,

  body: 'Wblock handling of Xrecords (and other Dictionary-resident objects) can be
    modified by changing the value of Dictionary.TreatElementsAsHard. Maybe this is
    what James is seeing?


    And - of course - you can customize deepcloning operations to meet your special
    needs using another Overrule ;-).'

    but it seems a net wblock function is needed. I will look around for one. great
    tip if that works!
