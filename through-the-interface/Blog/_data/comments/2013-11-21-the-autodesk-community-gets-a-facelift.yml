  body: 'Kean,

    Many DG users have been asking for a compact format to view headers, like NNTP
    would let us do years ago.

    The current pc viewable format shows 5 blank lines for every line with a header.
    If you have any push on this, the DG team needs your support to get that fixed,
    as it seems Autodesk is not letting them do it. You know how important a forum
    is to a company and a line of products, and this point in time is arguably the
    most critical, with Bricscad having prety much full API compatability. Autodesk
    needs to shine, and its actually reverse optimizing its advantage with the bloated
    web format. Disturbing that a new format was launched without addressing the most
    requested change. thx'
