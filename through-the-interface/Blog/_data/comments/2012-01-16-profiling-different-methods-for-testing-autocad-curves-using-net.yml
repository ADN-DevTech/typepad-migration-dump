    I''m curious why you chose GetDistAtPoint initially instead of GetParamAtPoint.
    I would expect GPAP to be more efficient than GDAP, and hence lead to a less lopsided
    result.


    I''d be interested in seeing the results of running these tests on polylines with
    more than 10k vertices (which are not all that rare in the wild).'

  body: 'My choice was purely arbitrary - I didn''t expect there to be any real difference
    in performance between the two, and suspected that GDAP would somehow work when
    GPAP didn''t (but that was just in the back of my mind... I recall having had
    funny results with GPAP, in the past, but that doesn''t mean GDAP performed better
    under those circumstances, whatever they were).


    I ran the tests again with GPAP versions being called alongside the others, and
    it did indeed perform slightly better (but you wouldn''t see the difference when
    comparing with GCP, overall). It performed quite a bit (~30%) better on Splines
    (when on, not off), which is interesting to note.

  body: Kean, you may want to consider using System.Diagnostics.Stopwatch class to
    get the time as it is more lightweight and more precise.

  body: May be interesting to do a custom function to test for circles, as it's very
    easy to test for distance from point to the center equal radius, and compare against
    the "native" ones.

  body: 'Indeed! Although you''d also need to make sure it was in the plane of the
    circle, which would add some cost.


    Do let us know if you happen to try it. :-)
