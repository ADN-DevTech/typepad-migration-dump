  body: "Regarging: \n\nNSString *col =\n        (i <= 10) ? [colors objectAtIndex:i]\
    \ : @\"FFFFFF\";\n\nThe modulous (%) operator is a good way to deal with indexes\
    \ that are out of range of the array.\n\nFor example (in c#):\n\n   static Color[]\
    \ colors = new Color[] {\n      Color.Red,\n      Color.White,\n      Color.Blue};\n\
    \n   static Color GetColor( int index )\n   {\n     return colors[ index % colors.Length\
    \ ];\n   }"

    I used Jing to record it, which means it requires Adobe Flash to be installed
    for it to work (perhaps ironically for a post about iOS ;-).
