  body: 'Hi Kean,


    Thanks for posting this, although I apologize for causing you to take this detour.
    The moral of this story is that these days our programs (including those written
    for AutoCAD) are never self-contained or self-reliant. We reach out beyond our
    boundaries into the file system, external databases, web services, and even other
    COTS applications. Sometimes AutoCAD is the center of that universe, acting as
    a consumer of data and/or functionality provided by other systems, and sometimes
    it simply acts as a provider of data and/or functionality to another system. The
    role that AutoCAD plays is entirely dependent on the nature of the application,
    although at times this role may not be obvious at first.


    In the case of this exercise, AutoCAD’s role is to gather a few input parameters
    and then act as a display canvas for 2D and 3D geometry – something AutoCAD is
    great at, but certainly not the only option. (Incidentally, this is basically
    the same role that AutoCAD played in your “Kinect” series, right?)


    Anyway, my point isn’t to paint an overly simplistic view of AutoCAD, but as AutoCAD
    programmers, I think we need to really take a step back and think in more abstract
    terms about the true role AutoCAD plays in our applications. I have found that
    by doing this, the separation of concerns becomes crystal clear.


    I look forward to your next post…  :)'

    No need to apologise - it was a very valid (and valuable) detour. :-)


    Yes, I''ve used AutoCAD a few times in this way: Kinect was one of them, the Photosynth
    integration was another. Neither implementation was in any serious way dependent
    on AutoCAD, and were generally fairly loosely-coupled with the base platform.


    Thanks again!

  body: 'Kean, awesome posts! I''ve dealt with web services for websites, but never
    considered it as a repository for common code libraries (operating through a web
    service), specially for AutoCad. I suppose many apps these days operate this way
    and with Win8 will become even more common approach.


    But it makes me worried a little, if I want to use a facebook app, its clear that
    I will need a good network connection, but if all I want to do is use autocad
    and some special tool in it, I may be out in the boonies working at a remote site
    and not realizing that some part of my cad functionality needs internet connection.


    I''m sure there''s ways around the "no network connection", like caching libraries
    locally, what are your thoughts on that?'

    For sure you have to consider online vs. offline use of your software: for heavyweight
    analysis or rendering, then it''s probably fine to impose a base assumption of
    network availability, but for field-related work (or support for customers/markets
    where internet access is disallowed/patchy), that may well not be the case.


    I do expect network availability to improve over time - whether more available
    WiFi or 3G/4G - but that''s just my expectation.


    Some of this may be for longer term planning: thinking about building technology
    that you know can be migrated to the cloud when it makes sense for your customers.


    Cheers,
