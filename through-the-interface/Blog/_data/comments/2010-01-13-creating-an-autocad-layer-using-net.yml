    Sounds like an interesting topic (although I have to admit I haven''t spent much
    time worrying about unit conversion, myself). If you could send me an email with
    more information on how this would work, I''ll see whether it''s something I can
    address in a blog post.


    Regards,

    AutoCAD .NET Discussion Group</a> (otherwise).


    In this case you should read the DXF file into a Database object (whether using
    AutoCAD or RealDWG), perform your update and save it back.

  body: 'You can certainly use COM Interop to do things "more easily". The .NET API
    tends to be lower level, in many ways, and so provides more flexibility and also
    needs more care. This post is about showing the appropriate steps for using that
    API, not necessarily about showing the simplest approach.
