  body: 'Thanks for your article outlining the code for detaching an AutoCAD external
    reference using .NET. We can use all the help we can get. I work for McGraw Hill
    Construction and you can download an autocad drawing right from their site through
    their Sweets Network. <a href="http://products.construction.com/QuickLinks/caddetails">auto
