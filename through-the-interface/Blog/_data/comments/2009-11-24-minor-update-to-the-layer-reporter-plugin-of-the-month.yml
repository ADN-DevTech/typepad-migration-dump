  body: "Hi Kean. I'm probably guilty of not really showing the 'better' approach\
    \ here, because in most of your code where you adapted the multiple calls to Add(),\
    \ you could have also substituted a single call to the AddFormat() method, which\
    \ works like the String's Format() method, taking a format string with placeholders,\
    \ and a variable number of additional parameters, each replacing one of the placholders\
    \ in the output string. I frequently do that for the sake of readability, since\
    \ the format string makes it easier to visualize what the final output will look\
    \ like, and since it uses a StringBuilder internally to build the result, it also\
    \ avoids extensive concatenation.\n\nIn the larger picture, it also 'occurred\
    \ to me' after posting that comment, that had I ever needed something like this,\
    \ I would have chosen an XML-based approach, along with a schema and XSLT to transform\
    \ the XML into an HTML report. With that approach, I could simply output the layer\
    \ data in XML, which can very easily be transformed to an equivalent HTML report,\
    \ but can also be easily pulled into Excel, Word, Access, etc., for a broad range\
    \ of other uses.\n\nI mention this because it would be beneficial to those who\
    \ are just learning .NET, but may not yet be familiar with all it has to offer,\
    \ to not get the wrong impression that this plug-in is demonstrative of how HTML\
    \ data output is typically generated in .NET applications. I would even dare to\
    \ say that most reasonably-skilled .NET programmers would call an application\
    \ like this, that generates HTML for report output directly in code, 'a hack',\
    \ and I would have to agree with that.\n\nI don't mean to belittle this plug in,\
    \ but it is worth pointing out that the .NET Framework provides us with better\
    \ and more robust ways of doing the type of thing this plug in does, in ways that\
    \ allow far greater flexibility in what can be done with the resulting output,\
    \ and require far less effort in the long run, when taking into account the common\
    \ need to customize the report output format.\n\nTo underscore that, consider\
    \ how much effort would be required to change the format of the report output\
    \ generated by this plugin. Like perhaps, adding, removing, or reording columns,\
    \ etc. \n\nWhen using the tools .NET provides us with for doing this type of thing,\
    \ changing the output format would take only a few minutes and require little\
    \ or no code revisions, verses what could easily require significant effort to\
    \ rework code like this.\n\nPerhaps a fully-customizable XML/XSLT-based layer\
    \ data exporter and report generator might be a worthy topic for a future plugin\
    \ of the month?"

  body: Ok, to correct myself and in all fairness, I didn't bother to download and
    try it, but I now notice that it does allow you to choose the font and the output
    columns (but not control their order).

  body: 'I agree that using XML & XSLT would provide more flexibility - and I had
    similar thoughts, as I''m a long-time fan of clear separation between data and
    presentation - but the goal of this app is to remain as simple as possible and
    accessible to people who want to customize it. Now this may sound counter-intuitive
    - as making the separation would help people customize the display by modifying
    stylesheets rather than code - but the level of knowledge needed to work with
    XSLT is unfortunately pretty high, while many more people have the HTML skills
    needed to understand and extend this code.


    So it''s a very valid point that one possible way to take this further would be
    to switch to generating and transforming XML, but I stand by the original design
    decision to use HTML directly for the sake of simplicity.


    I don''t personally feel it''s "a hack" to create HTML rather than XML, but of
    course you''re entitled to your opinion.


    Thanks for the input,

  body: 'Oh, and I used Append() because I didn''t see Add() and AddFormat() (perhaps
    it''s because of the use of a different framework version?).

  body: "Sorry, my mistake. It's AppendFormat() not AddFormat() (sheesh)....\n\nRegarding\
    \ XML->XLST->HTML, I don't agree that it's all that difficult, and in fact, I\
    \ think it's easier than fidgeting with code that generates HTML directly.\n\n\
    At the page below you can play with 'live' XML and XLST, and see the result immediately\
    \ after clicking a button. \n\nIt took me about 15 seconds to add a few columns\
    \ to the HTML output:\n\n  <a href=\"http://www.w3schools.com/xsl/tryxslt.asp?xmlfile=cdcatalog&xsltfile=cdcatalog\"\
    >http://www.w3schools.com/xsl/tryxslt.asp?xmlfile=cdcatalog&xsltfile=cdcatalog</a>\n\
    \nI also think most would find data that's rendered in a form that can be pulled\
    \ directly into Excel; SQL Server, or what have you, to be preferrable to an HTML\
    \ report that you can't really do much with besides look at. For example, it can't\
    \ be sorted, filtered, etc."

  body: 'I guess we''re going to have to agree to disagree, Tony. In any case, an
    XML-based solution is out of scope for this initial release.


    And by the way: Excel does a great job of pulling in the MHT output from the tool,
    in case you haven''t tried that.

    Yes, but unfortunately bitmaps representing colors and layer states have no translation
    to the logical data values they''re used to represent.'

  body: 'Not as the code stands... I did think about this, and have created a (currently
    unposted) version that sets the "alt" text properly for the various image tags.


    If you then right-click on the report and say "Export to Microsoft Excel" you
    get the underlying data (rather than the bitmaps) nicely into Excel.


    Oh, and I still can''t find AppendFormat().
