  body: 'Kean, this feature seems like it has potential.

    A listing of Acad add-ons is not new, of course, but it seems the installation
    process has been integrated, similar to my Droid.

    With Acad, the process has traditionally been to put the downloaded files in a
    support path of our choosing, then set up the loading through menus, acaddoc.lsp,
    or other "load on demad" mechanisms.

    For a new tool to really work, it needs to play well with CAD Managers, who generally
    like to control what is installed and how its organized.  Does this app store
    feature allow that?  Or does it control things via a compiled settings file that
    you must deal with or you don''t get the app?

    thx'

    management on consumer-oriented (particularly mobile) platforms.


    Control by CAD Managers is definitely on our radar, but isn''t in this initial
    release.

  body: How is going to evolve the localization of these apps? This is for example
    a big mess on the Android market, what are the plans for AutoCAD Exchange Apps?
    The idea "I see only the apps of my language" is a so bad idea in our interconnected
    world. My proposal (probably too late but I have not been asked), is a language
    filter drop down list, let's keep it simple...

  body: checked into it, the app gets put in a profile folder, and can be moved later
    if needed.  It seems there is no extra control over the apps imposed by the store
    management system of add ons, so they play nicely it seems.

  body: 'Hi Kean,


    I hadn''t tried to look at the Apps store you mention until just now, and whatever
    URL I try I always end up redirected to <a href="http://exchange.autodesk.com/autocad">http://exchange.autodesk.com/autocad</a>
    - Whether I''m logged in or not I can never seem to get to the app store itself.
    (I''ve tried Google Chrome 12, Internet Exploder 8, and even my Android device
    but to no avail!) :(


    Any ideas?


    Thanks,


    Alex.


    PS. Out of curiosity I tried the https:// version of the same URL you list above
    (figuring that as you can purchase some of these Apps it would need to be secured)
    and, after ignoring the "Certificate not valid" warnings, I simply get a "Service
    Unavailable" message?'

  body: 'Hi Alex,


    I expect we''ve disabled the out-of-product experience (which does make some sense):
    the appropriate way to access the store is from within AutoCAD 2012. The whole
    experience is pretty tightly integrated with the product.


    I included the link in my post as it happened to work - which surprised me, at
    the time - and so it''s less of a surprise that it''s no longer working.


    Regards,


    Kean'

    What happens if you make the toolbars visible again using the TOOLBAR command?
