  body: 'Hi Kean,


    What about saved 32-bit integers? How the DWG filer will deal saved values as
    32-bit and loaded values on 64-bit version of AutoCAD2008?


    Suppose I have saved a number as an Adesk::Int32 on my 2007 (or 32-bit 2008) application
    and then the same application will load this DWG into 2008 64-bit. Will be this
    value correctly loaded as Adesk::LongPtr?


    I have experienced some problems with CTime due its 32/64-bit change during some  UNICODE
    migrations I have made...hope the ObjectARX 2008 does not bring new issues like
    this.


    As you said, the types are polymorphic but the DWG files is binary and should
    be compatible with both 32-bit (2008 and 2007) and 64-bit (2008) versions.


    Thank you.

    Fernando.'

  body: 'Hi Fernando,


    There should be no change to what is stored in the DWG format - it doesn''t change
    at all between 32- and 64-bit versions. This should be automatic for ObjectARX
    applications saving native datatypes.


    If you''re saving a custom datatype (one that we do not handle natively) that
    changes in size between 32- and 64-bit environments, then you will need to adapt
    your code to make sure a consistently sized value is stored to the DWG, otherwise
    it will be very hard to transfer files between users on different platforms.

    I installed an upgrade to Revit9-ACAD2007 combination pack last night.  The ACAD2008

    way I found out was to download 3DSOUT after the installation. That comes in both
    a 32bit & 64bit flavor.  So....I searched today to find out what is going on.


    I have been using, out of necessity and for a few years, XP64 both at work and
    at home.  I have been half-way satisfied that many Autodesk products would run
    as 32bit programs in a 64bit environment.


    Question:  I can find no reference to whether the ACAD2008 install is really &
    truly a 64bit version.  How do I tell?


    Question:  Since the installer made no reference to a 64bit version possibility,

    into the program directory?

    I have been working with VBA autocad for a long time. I''ve recently upgraded
    to a 64bit os and a 64 bit autocad. when I''m debuging the program hangs, specially
    on a GETXXX command. Is this normal??'

    I don''t know - I''m still on 32-bit Windows and also rarely use VBA.


    I do know that VBA is currently a 32-bit process that talks to 64-bit AutoCAD
    using (the typically inefficient) inter-process communication.


    I don''t know if this causes an issue with debugging: I suggest posting your question
    to ADN or the appropriate discussions group.

    That isn''t the first time I''ve heard this. It''s unlikely to happen, though:
    a book would take too much linear thinking on my part, and by the time I''d completed
    it paper books would probably have been banned for being unecological. :-)
