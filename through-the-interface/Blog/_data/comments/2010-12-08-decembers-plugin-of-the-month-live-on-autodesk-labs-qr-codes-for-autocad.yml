  body: Great work! Thanks to you both. Works perfectly; as you said, the idea to
    create a hatch object is great, but how is it done? The answer is in the code,
    for sure... I suggested on my CAD site more than one year ago the use of 2D codes
    in AutoCAD drawings, but at the time, I created them by hand! (well by Google...)

  body: 'Hi Patrick,


    OK, I''ve just looked mores closely at the code, to understand it better myself.
    :-)


    If you look at the AcadHatchQREncoder.cs file, you''ll see where we call through
    the open source QR Codes library to encode the data as a 2D (square) matrix of
    Boolean flags indicating whether each square is set or not.


    We then iterate through that array, creating loops for all the squares that are
    set. Which means that each square - even if adjacent to others that are "on" -
    is a separate island in the hatch. So I suspect there are opportunities to optimise
    the resultant hatch by merging islands (probably during creation). Do let us know
    if you come up with a more optimal algorithm that you''d like to share. ;-)


    Cheers,


    Kean'

    The idea to create it all from one large hatch is a great idea, but can it be
    created inside an anonymous block?

    When selecting this large of a hatch, it can be slow while all the grips generate.
    Plus, you don''t want someone to accidentally grip edit the hatch....'

  body: 'Hi all,


    I comment from the "Agreement" that comes before the download:

    "2.1 Grant of License-Testing and Evaluation. ... Without limiting the foregoing,
    Tester may not use the Pre-Release Products for competitive analysis, or commercial,
    professional, or other for-profit purposes."


    That seems to mean, that I may not use the Plug-In for any commercial purposes,
    not using it just normal for QR-Coding my draftings in my company nor reusing
    the code to create some commercial work off of it. Is that true? In that case
    it would be completely useless. Why is it then released??!!!?? Or why does Autodesk
    try sooo hard (again and again) to really upset it''s customers? We all bought
    Autocad for commercial reasons and not for fun!!! Therefore we don''t need Plug-Ins
    that we can not use commercially!!!


    Maybe I misunderstand it? Or is there a commercial version that I can buy?

  body: 'Hi Stephan,


    I believe we''re using the standard Autodesk Labs EULA for our Plugins of the
    Month. I''ll pass you comments on to Scott Sheppard, to see what he has to say
    about the terms of usage.


    My understanding is that this is about limiting liability related to the use of
    plugins that have not put through the formal QA process our company uses for officially
    released software. The same is probably true of the source code, but clearly the
    terms have been crafted primarily for compiled modules: it''s absolutely our expectation
    that you extend the source code for use commercially, providing you undersand
    that it''s your responsibility to ensure it works well for your (or your customers'')
    purposes.


    As for Autodesk "trying so hard to upset its customers", I''m afraid I find that
    comment quite offensive. Autodesk Labs is about connecting with customers, learning
    about and meeting their needs. I think the breadth and depth of the technology
    available on the site speaks for itself. And I might also add that my team and
    I spend a great deal of effort (professionally and personally) in efforts to please
    (even to delight) our customers.

    I am sorry for the obviously offensive line. I was a little upset when I wrote
    the comment and for sure it is an overstatement. I had even stronger words in
    the first draft, wich I deleted out before posting.

    Please, be assured that I was not referring to you or your team. I really like
    your blog. I was referring to Autodesk as a big company as a whole in general
    and for sure I did not want to offend anybody personally.


    Kind regards,

    Nice tool. I would work a little bit on my side to polish the GUI (I''m kind of
    picky about it :) and to translate the application in French.


    One little warning though for potential users, don''t try to separate the hatches
    (not even out of curiosity) because this will generate a FATAL ERROR message.


    Best Regards,

    programming, but I am wondering if the text data, url or whatever can be stored
    in a block as an attribute.  Is it possible to either create a custom property
    to create the data, or to directly change the XData without the QRED command?


    Thanks for the tool!
