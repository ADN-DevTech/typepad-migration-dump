  body: "Hi Kean. \nI just thought I'd mention that I installed the Productivity Power\
    \ Tools, because I liked the Solution Navigator, the Auto Brace Completion, and\
    \ rhe Organize Imports features (the Enhanced scrollbar was kind of nice, too,\
    \ but there are other add-ins that provide that).  However, since installing the\
    \ Tools, I have experienced some rather strange and very annoying problems that\
    \ have now caused me to disable the Tools altogether.  \n\n-----"
