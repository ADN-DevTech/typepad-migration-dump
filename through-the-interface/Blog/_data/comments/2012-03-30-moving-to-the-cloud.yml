  body: 'I second Adam about the risk of moving too fast to the cloud while infrastructures
    are still lagging behind.

    I live in a modern and civilized country (Italy), but it will take years before
    connection will be granted for everyone and many more before high-speed connection
    will be widely available to allow on-line computing to be used on a daily base.


    Nevertheless, most of the cloud advantages listed above, can be achieved locally
    by other means, like virtualization.

    In this respect, given my 30 years IT experience, I see Information Technology
    sometime repeat itself, every 10 or 15 years the paradigm shifts between centralization
    (mainframes, terminal services, virtualization) and delocalization (desktop pc,
    notebooks, smartphones).

    Different hardware, but same concepts aimed to different needs, I believe the
    error is to thing one paradigm is better than the other and cannot get along together.'

    I suppose I consider myself an optimist (or maybe a futurist?) regarding the required
    infrastructure. Just as PCs weren''t capable enough to run CAD when they first
    hit the market, the march of progress (in this case measured by Moore''s Law)
    meant it eventually became feasible.


    In many ways I think we''re in a similar situation, right now in that (for instance)
    internet access isn''t as pervasive as it needs to (and will one day) be. In time
    we''ll also have redundant means of access - if one goes down, another can kick
    in. Some people have that today with WiFi and 3/4G (although we may well end up
    with something quite different, technology-wise).


    I also think that we will eventually establish a more flexible approach to running
    software: in the cases where we really have a dumb terminal (low local compute
    power), it will all run in the cloud and do the equivalent of streaming pixels.
    In the case where there are more usable local compute resources (and a smart phone
    would even fit into that category) more processing could occur locally. It''s
    going to be some time before we have code that can easily shift between cloud-based
    and local cores, depending on availability, but my bet is that it''ll happen sometime
    in the next decade. We''ll see! :-)

  body: 'I think perhaps I need to clarify my role, here. I''m not Autodesk''s cloud
    spokesperson. In this particular situation I''m helping educate our development
    community on industry trends. Software developers have to effectively anticipate
    (or, at least, harness) technological shifts in order to maintain successful businesses.


    As I''ve speculated (and while I might suggest it''s reasonably well-informed,
    it does remain speculation) within the next decade (or two, at the outside) we
    will reach a point where most software is delivered via the cloud. Where it gets
    run will depend on local compute resources, but the existing model of local installation
    is - in the main-part - going away. That''s not to say that I know of any plans
    for Autodesk to stop allowing software installation anytime soon - we''ll probably
    provide it as long as a significant number of customers request it, I imagine
    - but that''s the way things are generally going in the software industry.


    There are, of course, many questions that need to be addressed, in the meantime.
    Questions around security, privacy, service levels, etc. If they''re not addressed
    to the satisfaction of our customers, they''ll continue to work as they do today
    (or possibly invest in private cloud infrastructures, etc.).


    Anyway - I''m not trying to convince anyone of the correctness of this "vision",
    nor that we (Autodesk) are necessarily the best providers of cloud-based technology
    to our customers (although I of course hope this ends up being the case). This
    series of posts is intended to educate software developers on how to start moving
    software capabilities to the cloud, where it makes sense for them to do so: knowledge
    which I expect to be beneficial for many people out there.


    Please do keep the comments coming, everyone. I''m very happy to see peoples''
    opinions of these shifts relative to our industry. I won''t agree with all of
    them, but then neither will I expect you to agree with mine. :-)

  body: 'Kean, What I am not clear on is how Autodesk would handle customization,
    or let''s say "add-ons".

    My company treats AutoCad/C3D as a graphical OS, and does all kinds of things
    that are not part of the OOTB system. We have several folders of tools, plot configs,
    and so on. I have worked on AutoCad since version 10, and now (CAD) manage over
    60 users in a few offices. I''ve watched Autodesk change things about AutoCad
    each release, and my conclusion is they now have a mess on their hands. It seems
    they never sat down and decided where settings should go, but only added on as
    new features arose. We now have a mix of registry, xmls, daisy chained menus,
    and workspaces embedded in menus.

    I am still seeing confusion on Autodesk''s part about basic menu configuration.
    They do not have a recommended basic setup that is consistent. The default profiles
    confuse the heck out of people if they compare them.

    So if we were to run acad via a service, how would Autodesk accomodate this? Must
    our tools be on the cloud? I consider this the most important issue to this cloud
    idea, similar to how important keeping Lisp is to Autocad. You handle it wrong,
    and every other cad product becomes extremely attractive. I think there needs
    to be a lot of discussion about what cad managers consider right and wrong handling.
    The problem is Autodesk has gotten most of these kinds of issues very wrong in
    recent years. It seems like they just do not have time to tryly investigate real
    usage at real companies. I would hear about it if they did, as cad managers in
    southern california stick together and talk. Autodesk has not shown the needed
    interest so far to define the real challenges IMO.'

    I''d rather this didn''t become a discussion about how Autodesk might take specific
    products to the cloud (as much as anything I''m really not at liberty to discuss
    such plans publicly).


    Of course it''s a "paradigm shift" (yes, I put that in quotes because I dislike
    the term) - and we inevitably have to balance legacy issues with the opportunities
    presented by this brave new world - and there''s always risk involved.


    Ultimately we''re committed to making our products strong platforms - both for
    independent software vendors and for internal customization & development - so
    we''ll be working hard to make this work.

  body: "Kean,\n\nWarning:  wall of text ahead.  I appreciate that you are not the\
    \ 'cloud spokesperson' for Adesk, but I think that the points you made, while\
    \ addressed to the developer community, need a response.\n\nWhile vendors may\
    \ be excited about moving to the cloud and offering software as a service, the\
    \ rationale is not in the least a benefit to the customer.  The real reasons are\
    \ to maximize revenue to the vendor irregardless of quality of the product, and\
    \ to minimize the control customers have over their data- transferring that control\
    \ to the vendor and encouraging customer lock-in. Especially given Autodesk's\
    \ published ToS for 360 - there is zero reason to entrust any customer design\
    \ information to their cloud services.\n\nAs to the specific points you mention,\
    \ the politest thing to say is 'that happens not to be the case'. \n\nPerformance:\
    \  you specifically mention chunking up data and paralleization as benefits to\
    \ the cloud.  It's important to point out that this is not a feature specific\
    \ to 'teh cloud', and could be better addressed using private grid computing within\
    \ an organization.  There's no reason (from a customer's perspective) that the\
    \ rendering actions should happen elsewhere, when there are spare CPU cycles within\
    \ the company, and inside the companies firewall. Having built more than one render\
    \ farm, and a continuous user of BOINC for the past 4 years, I know that such\
    \ an approach is technically feasible, and far more secure and reliable than a\
    \ remote hosted service.\n\nScalability:  I'll give you half a point on this,\
    \ but it only applies to a limited subset of use cases, and is totally irrelevant\
    \ to CAD and design usage.  I may be able to provision extra computational resources,\
    \ but staff, especially knowledgeable staff familiar with code and design requirements,\
    \ are a far different story.\n\nReliability:  Sorry, but that's absolute horse\
    \ hockey.  If the resources I need are at the far end of a tenuous connection,\
    \ filled with a multitude of point failures, reliability is non-existent.  What's\
    \ the merit of a remote service with 5-9s up-time when a backhoe tears through\
    \ a line down the road?  If I'm running desktop applications installed locally,\
    \ the impact is minimal. SaS -- I'm out of business.\n\nLow Cost: That is almost\
    \ assuredly incorrect.  Given the realities of software vendors, and a multi-decade\
    \ long effort to lock customers in, we as customers can expect that the total\
    \ cost will only increase, and that the ability to move our proprietary design\
    \ information outside of any given vendor's cloud will be severely limited.  Heck,\
    \ try moving a Civil3d Alignment to a competitive platform now, and see how much\
    \ of the design intent goes with it.  We as customers can only expect ongoing\
    \ incremental charges, small individually but certainly larger than alternatives.\
    \    Realistically, the best way for a customer to ensure his lowest total cost\
    \ is to work with competitors, encourage competition between vendors, and hold\
    \ vendors accountable for quality and performance of their software.  Nothing\
    \ in that is material to cloud computing or SaS.\n\nFollowing up with your 'Whens'\
    \ - which look a lot more like \"Whys\"..\n\nComputation intensive:  grid computing\
    \ works, and is far more secure than a remote, untrusteable vendor's cloud services.\
    \  Work with BOINC, and pass those specific tasks, whether fluid dynamics or rendering,\
    \ off to the secretary's desktop, or the machine of the person tied up in meetings.\
    \  Better, faster, more secure, and more reliable.\n\nCollaboration:  Given the\
    \ terms of service of Autodesk's offering, any CIO who does not block that service\
    \ at the firewall should be terminated for incompetence, and any employee who\
    \ utilizes has probably committed a firing offense under the corporate IT policies.\
    \  WS may work, but is unusable.  As is, there are better options, with more flexibility,\
    \ reliability, and security.  A self-hosted eRoom for example.\n\nFrequent changes:\
    \  Certainly not a customer benefit - more of an excuse for a vendor to release\
    \ alpha grade software as release and charge accordingly.  Breaking customer applications,\
    \ rendering their data unusable, skipping real testing in favor of customer testing\
    \ -- not good for the people trying to get work done.\n\nLarge data sets:  OK,\
    \ I’ll give you that one, sorta.  but you're missing, or ignoring, the point that\
    \ transfer of large data sets across an internet takes an inordinate amount of\
    \ time.  If have have a couple of terabytes of data to move coast-to-coast, FedEx\
    \ is faster, and won't degrade everyone else in the company's ability to use the\
    \ internet.  Again, grid computing, using an internal BOINC setup, is a better\
    \ solution for customers and end users.\n\nPricing information -- maybe yes, that's\
    \ out of my areas of concern.  but immaterial to CAD and design.\n\n\nCustomer\
    \ intimacy:  well, the big brother side is more important -- what I do with the\
    \ product I’ve paid for is none or your business, and attempts to mine my interactions\
    \ with the software are equivalent to spyware.  There's an ethical leap to make,\
    \ moving from the light side to the dark side, for any vendor to implement that.\n\
    \nTechnology abstraction:  I'll give you that one too -- but it's pretty irrelevant\
    \ to customers or users.  Any benefit to the developer, is outweighed by the negatives\
    \ to SaS for the customer.\n\nDevice support:  Trendy, but.... monoculture is\
    \ bad, diversity is good, competition is good.  Pretending that it, whatever 'it'\
    \ is, will just work on any browser means that the specific abilities/features\
    \ of my equipment are being ignored, and the software is working to the lowest\

    Thanks for taking the time to put this comment together. I''ll try to keep my
    response shorter (it''s Good Friday and we''re lucky that it''s a public holiday
    here in Switzerland).


    I''ll start by saying that I respectfully disagree.


    Firstly, if the benefits are only for software vendors, why on earth do 100% of
    Fortune 500 CIOs believe the cloud is critical to their future IT infrastructure?
    (I made that statistic up, by the way, but I wouldn''t be at all surprised if
    it turned out to be true. :-)


    Beyond that, I''m really not going to get into a discussion on the specific points:
    it''s clear you''re coming at this from your own perspective. I believe this industry
    shift is happening and is going to continue (whether I like it or not). You either
    don''t believe it''s going to happen, or would rather it didn''t. There are details
    related to the design software industry, etc., but frankly in the long run I don''t
    see our issues as being so very different that we would do anything but lag the
    rest of the software by a matter of years (that''s what happened with the shift
    to the PC, anyway).


    It''s great you''ve taken the time to express your views, irrespective of whether
    they agree with mine. I might just set myself a reminder to check back on this
    blog post in 10 years time, to see which one of us turned out to be right. Assuming
    the internet and the planet still exist at that point, of course.

    You can see that the three areas of what we call the cloud, must be clearly referred
    to when discussing the issues.

    There is virtualized desktops, data storage location, and software "running location"

    JG''s comments picked on particular areas, so was specific.

    When you replied that you disagreed, you stayed general.

    You are saying "It" is going to happen, and each person can believe it will or
    not.

    But there is no one "It". The move to virtualized desktops is a perfect example.
    What did the CIO''s have in mind when they said the move to the cloud was critical?

    I think we are actually all in agreement on many levels, then would disagree on
    how optimistic we are that certain critical details get worked out.

    You have to admit, if Autodesk relied on say, visual studio, for all coding, and
    MS said they were going to release a new version every year, and provide as SAS,
    you would not play that in a liberal manner. If it failed, and you were one in
    charge, what excuse would you have? So you will see that same conservitive nature
    on the side of people in charge of production.

    There is no reason to expect that to change, and it should not change, so I think
    those CIO''s better check with reality before they get all optimistic on SAS.'

  body: 'Mr L.:


    I''ll start by repeating that this series of posts is not about Autodesk software
    moving to the cloud: it''s intended for application developers who have code integrated
    with our various platforms.


    Certainly, if you''re talking about moving .rvt files around, as you might today,
    then the cloud doesn''t seem to make much sense. It might make more sense if multiple
    engineers were working on a genuinely centralised building information model,
    but that''s besides the point (as this series is not about Autodesk software,
    after all).


    The benefits described are those we''ve communicated to - and have in my opinion
    been well received by - our external development community. For instance, there
    are several developers with frequently changing code and data (such a pricing
    data, that I''ve already listed as an example) who already benefit greatly from
    this style of system architecture.


    And my point about trust was quite deliberately made (although none of my points
    were intended to make you laugh, on balance). If you don''t see the benefit of
    working in this way, then I don''t expect you to be forced to.

  body: 'hi kean (and all those taking time to post their thoughts on this issue).
    great brain snacking here-- thank you. for me, the issue essentially boils down
    to the simple analogy of whether or not a company wants to own and drive their
    own cars or rely on a taxi service for all their driving needs (or some combination).
    the best decision seems to depend on each company''s specific needs -- therefore
    i would never suggest that relying on a taxi service is always the better choice
    or suggest that the option for everyone to own their own cars might be going away.
    "cloud services" (offsite centralized computing managed by others) has actually
    been around a long time (no, we didn''t call "the cloud" back in the 60''s, but
    that''s essentially what it was). maintaining absolute confidentiality/security
    of our data alone (bogus service provider assurances aside) makes the cloud a
    moot option for us right now, but others may not care who has access to their
    data (or where it goes) -- cloud services may be a very viable option for others
    where security/confidentiality is not an issue. my point though: if education
    is our core goal here in this thread, then it seems the responsible thing to do
    to present both sides of the issue: the benefits and profitabilities of this technology
    as well as its (very empirical) drawbacks and risks, so that an honest and competent
    assessment can be made for any organization''s needs as to whether or not cloud
    technology is a helpful solution. you''ve given a very eloquent list of benefits
    and profitabilities, kean (thank you!). i for one would be very curious to read
    your thoughts on the drawbacks and risks.'

  body: 'Hi dave,


    Great to hear from you! :-)


    This post (and its accompanying series) isn''t really intended to encourage Autodesk
    customers to consider moving data to the cloud: it''s encouraging software developers
    to consider opportunities for moving (parts of) their applications to the cloud.
    With the assumption that at some point in the next few decades they are going
    to see benefits from having made this investment.


    I completely understand that many Autodesk customers have various quite valid
    concerns about the use of the cloud with respect to their business. But developers
    need to anticipate industry trends and be ready for the point at which the customer
    benefits become compelling.


    Ultimately this is a pitch for (and a bet on) a certain future state. I''m not
    in a position to recommend whether an individual Autodesk customer is best served
    by the cloud or a local computing infrastructure, but I can say that developers
    who chose to ignore this trend are more likely to get a nasty surprise, sooner
    or later.


    Looking forward to chewing the fat on this topic at AU,

  body: 'hi Kean :o) thanks for taking time on this post (and this blog in general).
    it always keeps me thinking ahead and that in and of itself is a good thing. i
    think we''re on the same page with regard to the benefit of any developer examining
    the prospect of porting his/her/their services and products to a cloud environment.
    i would only add that i think ti is equally important for any developer to consider
    the dangers and risks they face by doing so. looking forward to chatting at AU
    and thanks again for all your time on this blog. really good stuff here.
