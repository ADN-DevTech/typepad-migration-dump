  body: 'Kean, does it feel odd to you that basic autocad does not have support for
    3d printing formats, like stl?

    It makes me wonder if they do not bother because the program is $5000 a seat.
    Kind of makes you wonder why people buy it instead of Bricscad. It may be for
    the object enabler support, and it does have the best pdf printer driver (like,
    better than its dwf driver! crazy). All I''m saying is there is a gap that I bet
    would be somewhat fun to fill.'

    Apologies in advance for my ignorance: what is it about the STLOUT command that
    doesn''t work for you?
