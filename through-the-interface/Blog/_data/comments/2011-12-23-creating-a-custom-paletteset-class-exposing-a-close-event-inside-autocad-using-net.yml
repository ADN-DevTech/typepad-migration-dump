  body: "Hi Kean,\n\nSince your CheckPaletteSetState command method is defined inside\
    \ the PaletteSet2 class, you’re allowed to access non-static events on any PaletteSet2\
    \ instance within the scope of that method. Just make your event non-static, and\
    \ then change the code that fires the event to:\n\nif (ps.PaletteSetClosed !=\
    \ null)\n\tps.PaletteSetClosed(ps, new EventArgs());\n\nMerry Christmas!\n\n-\

    Merry Christmas to you, too! :-)


    If memory serves me correctly, there was some kind of runtime issue that stopped
    me getting it working (something I should have more accurately documented in the
    blog post, thinking about it).


    Did you happen to get it working on your end, by any chance? I''ll try again in
    January, if not.


    Cheers,

    I made, but I'll email you my code just in case.

    Must have done something dumb (time to take a break ;-).

    Interesting ''workaround''


    I was just wondering what happens if a palleteset is closed while a command is
    in progress (if it''s docked it will cancel out the command, but if it''s floating
    the command should continue to remain in progress, that is until the SendStringToExecute
    ''hack'' is processed.'

  body: 'It''s pretty simple to get the behaviour you want, either way... I can see
    some people might want the active command cancelled (in which case prefix the
    command string sent to the command-line with a couple of escape characters) while
    others might want the behaviour you''ve described (where you can register the
    CHECKPALETTESETCLOSE command as CommandFlags.Transparent and prefix the command
    string with an apostrophe).


    I gave it a quick test and it seemed to work well.

    sending command input (which I''ve always regarded as a gruesome kludge - and

    verify that).

    I hadn''t seen any crash reports, myself, but it''s good to know you''ve found
    a way to avoid them, should I now hear of any.

    The above code is good but even if the event is fired always,the code inside it
    is not executed always. I am clearing my selection set on palette close but it
    is not cleared always.Can you suggest some solution.'

    If you can tell me when the code isn''t executed (i.e. under which circumstances)
    then perhaps I can suggest a solution.

    Sorry for the delay - this comment got flagged as spam - no idea why. :-(


    Off the top of my head I don''t, I''m afraid. Have you tried checking in with
    ADN or the discussion groups (I assume you must have - this comment is now 3 weeks
    old)?

  body: 'Hi Kean,


    on your code in creating paletteset, i am trying to call a wcf i created in c#
    to iterate result and create palettes, but i am getting an endpoint missing, on
    a normal windows app. it is working, but i do the process on your code its an
    error.. any ideas on this?


    Steps:

    1. Add Service Reference to the WCF

    2. Code: using AutoLibrary.DLService;

    3.             ServiceLibraryClient library = new ServiceLibraryClient();


    when the code step hits step 3, error occurs.


    any help and tips will be greatly appreciated :)


    thanks'
