  body: 'On the menu subject, think about the impacts of making a custom menu be the
    main.

    First, I have not seen things work right when things like the civil3d "civil"
    menu are not the main.

    Second, its no good having custom be the main menu as some places use such a menu
    in several profiles, even for several products. We have network c3d and acad,
    so it no good loading a custom menu with civil as partial, into an acad session.
    You get the civil menu because its daisy chained to the custom menu. That is the
    problem with the CUI system, its now daisy-chained, unlike the old system before
    2006 where you had a main and unchained partials. Autodesk did not think that
    through and it comes up anytime you look at ootb profiles for acad and c3d. What
    should the main menu be? Autodesk is confused about that so let us know if you
    find someone who claims to understand the cui design intent. Bit of a rant but
    it remains broken IMO.'

    way to go in a number of scenarios (it''s the best way I''ve seen to get custom
    shortcuts working, for instance).
