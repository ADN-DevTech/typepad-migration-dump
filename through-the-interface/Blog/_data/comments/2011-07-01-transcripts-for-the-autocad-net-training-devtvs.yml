  body: 'What would be a great compliment to these labs is a complete sample application
    that puts forward some best practices for ARX development.


    Today, I''m changing the logic for our custom tool palettes, and some of the old
    C++ code handles things differently from the new C# code.  It seems that the managed
    wrappers build in some functionality that the old c++ code would also benefit
    from, ie. setting the toolId of the palette.


    The ObjectARX SDK has evolved so much over the years, and you can grab snips of
    code here and there, but some of it is outdated. Some objects are not even coverered
    by sample code.


    This sample application would have both unmanaged and managed code and would showcase
    much of what has been added into AutoCAD recently.  It would also cover old concepts
    as well, highlighting any improvements that have been made in the API. The sample
    would also be a complete installable application.


    Microsoft does this with DinnerNow.net and such.  Maybe too much to ask for, but
    I think it would be a real asset to the development community.'

  body: 'Hi Jeff,


    Thanks for the suggestion.


    The breadth and depth of AutoCAD''s API set - as well as the variety of ways in
    which is is used - makes this very difficult to do.


    My personal view is that smaller, targeted samples end up being of more relevance
    to the community. We have a number of AutoCAD-focused Plugins of the Month on
    Autodesk Labs which show a simple, consistent approach to structuring and delivering
    apps. And in generaly we don''t want to encourage people who are new to our APIs
    to start working with unmanaged code unless there is a very clear need to do so
    (whether that''s Mac support or a need for custom objects that isn''t met by Overrules).


    That said, anyone can start an open source project: if you choose to do so I''d
    be happy to raise awareness of it.


    Regards,


    Kean
