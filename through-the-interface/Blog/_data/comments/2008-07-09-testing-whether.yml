  body: 'You mentioned "potential situations where this might not be true". I''m not
    sure what these situations are exactly and would love to know more. I am using
    RealDWG and I often have to iterate geometry to get extmax, which causes other
    problems (GeometricExtents being null?). So, what are these potential situations?


    Thanks in advance!'

    I''ve checked in with Engineering to get some specifics. Some situations are related
    to planar entities (about which I''m waiting for information), but there is another
    related to entity erasure/display:


    "When entities that define the extents are erased, or their layer is frozen, then
    the EXTMIN and EXTMAX sysvars won''t automatically move, at least in the 2D GS;
    that won’t happen until a ZOOM ALL/EXTENTS."


    It seems there are also issues with EXTMAX being updated when using the 3D GS
    - and this is more significant. If you set the Visual Style to conceptual (for
    instance) and create 3D geometry, EXTMIN/EXTMAX will not be updated to reflect
    the new extents.

  body: 'On the subject of planar entities: it''s just possible that someone is working
    in 2D, but on a 3D plane that is not aligned with the standard axes. EXTMAX would
    give a false positive at this point (although it seems a very rare situation,
    in my opinion).

  body: well by looking into the code to see to it if the drawing is 2d or 3d is really
    a smart idea

    How about checking the difference between the Z-Value of EXTMIN and EXTMAX? This
    might help in some situations.

    Yes, it might, although in the rare cases that the 2D plane is not aligned with
    the axes, this wouldn''t help. But again - that''s got to be a very rare case...

    How would you right this as a boolean statement for a contextual ribbon tab rule?

    That''s an interestng question.


    I''ll add it to my list of possible topics - you might try posting to <a href="http://discussion.autodesk.com/forums/forum.jspa?forumID=152">the
    AutoCAD .NET Discussion Group</a>, in the meantime.
