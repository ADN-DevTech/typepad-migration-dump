  body: 'That''s pretty cool. (The HTTrack tool)


    I''ve done something similar with the Autodesk discussion website - I have on
    my laptop a complete backup of all the useful discussion groups, which I''ve then
    allowed Copernic Desktop to index, so when I want to find out about a particular
    topic I can do it without using Thunderbird''s hit and miss search function. (We
    don''t have Office 2007 yet)'

    Publishing the full content of my posts via RSS is one option. But unfortunately
    that would be poor netiquette as my posts are often very large (and a large RSS
    feed isn''t generally appreciated).


    I''ve been told that <a href="http://www.torproject.org/">Tor</a> can be used
    to get through the firewall, but not being in China I haven''t tried this myself.


    Good luck with your move!
