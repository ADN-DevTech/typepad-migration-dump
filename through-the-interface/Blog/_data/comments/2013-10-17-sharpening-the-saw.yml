  body: Love the self-development point here. I've been pondering this theme a lot
    lately myself. Is 'Seven Habits' a worthwhile read overall...?

  body: 'Stephen Covey presented a session at an Autodesk conference some years ago
    (a potted version of his 7 Habits) and I also attended a training class on it
    over a couple of days. I don''t think I actually needed to read the book, after
    that (although I probably did end up skim-reading it).


    In all honesty I suspect you can get the (7) point(s) by reading a summary from
    somewhere like <a href="http://www.getabstract.com/en/summary/career-and-self-development/the-7-habits-of-highly-effective-people/3515/">getAbstract</a>
    (a tool some people at Autodesk have been using - seems pretty handy) or perhaps
    even <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Seven_Habits_of_Highly_Effective_People">Wikipedia</a>.
