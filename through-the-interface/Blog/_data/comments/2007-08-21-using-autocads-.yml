    I''m not sure what you mean by "open drawings", as I''m going to link in an Excel
    spreadsheet into the active drawing.


    Yes, you should be able to use an OpenFileDialog from a button on a form - I haven''t
    looked at what happens if it''s a modeless dialog, but a modal dialog should just
    work. A modeless dialog probably does, too, but I''d need to have a play around
    with it, to make sure. Unless someone else out there has already done this?


    Cheers,

  body: My bad. I didn't rialize that you were opening one excel file to update the
    active drawing.  Somehow, I though you were going to open one or more drawings
    and update them with information stored in an excel file.  The years don't pass
    without damage. Thanks

    Unfortunately not - OpenFileDialog wraps acedGetFileNavDialog(), which doesn''t
    support filter descriptions. At least I''m 85% sure it doesn''t. :-)

    I am using the Filedialog with the flags to AllowFoldersOnly.  I want to specify
    the starting folder location.  I tried entering it in the 2nd argument but that
    didn''t work. How should I go about doing that in addition to having it allow
    folders only?'
