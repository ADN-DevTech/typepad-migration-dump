    on the AutoCAD drawing editor.

  body: 'Kean,


    I am wondering how to do this on table objects. When importing a table from excel
    as pasting special ACAD objects, you can reset the table overrides, but this does
    not reset the cell content. You manually have to go through each cell to reset
    the formatting of the content.


    I have written an app that iterates through the selected table''s rows/columns
    and gets the content in an attempt to use the text editor to reset the content
    of each cell. However, the texteditor.create only allows for MTEXT in which the
    table content is not MTEXT.


    I''ve looked on your other blog posts on tables and don''t see a way to do this.
    Please help if you can.


    Thanks.


    Steve'
