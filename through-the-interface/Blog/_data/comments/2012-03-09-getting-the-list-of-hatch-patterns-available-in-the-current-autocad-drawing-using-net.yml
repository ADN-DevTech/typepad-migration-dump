  body: 'Hi Kean,

    this sample doesnt work for me, because there is an error with the foreach-loop
    with variables from Typ System.Collections.ObjectModel.ObservableCollection.

    Is there another way to get all the names?

    Thanks for help.

    Regards Jürgen'

    Which versions of .NET and AutoCAD are you targeting? foreach should just work
    on ObservableCollections...

    I''m targeting .Net 3.5 (Managed(v2.0, v1.1, v1.0)).

    What I think is that I cannot go through the ObservableCollections with foreach.

    Maybe its works with .Net 4.

    You''re probably right... it seems not that hard to add, though:

    I''ve figured it out.

    I have to reference WindowsBase. Now it works.

    The ADN-Team helps. Many thanks to them and to you.

    I know this post is over a year old and I apologize for asking such a question
    here, but do you know how I could get all hatch pattern names in .NET using the
    ObjectArx 2010 API? Your code only works for ObjectArx 2013. I searched the ObjectArx
    2010 docs but didn''t find anything.. does that mean I have to parse the acad.pat
    file to get the information?


    I''d greatly appreciate any help on this. Thanks in advance.


    Best Regards
