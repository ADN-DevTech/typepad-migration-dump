  body: 'This is soo cool!!! I am not an electrical engineer so needed a way to pratice
    at basic citcuits without worrying about having components or ruining stuff. What
    a brilliant idea to make it virtual with an easy interface.

    I have not tried it but this is a missing link to learning arduino/microcontrollers
    for me.'

  body: 'I''ve been playing with the 123d Circuits site, some definate bugs to be
    worked out. Speed is generally slow, and the search for component seems to only
    handle exact phrases. Also does not work on mobile devices I tried (note 10.1).
    Not a complaint, people should just be patient until its improved. Hopefully if
    Autodesk is involved they will push for fixes also.

    thx
