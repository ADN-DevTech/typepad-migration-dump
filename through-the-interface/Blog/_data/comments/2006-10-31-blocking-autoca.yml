    Once again I forgot to state that I wrote this code for AutoCAD 2007, and it will
    not necessarily work with previous versions.

  body: Is there a way to modify a command rather then blocking it all together?  I
    ask as I'm looking at using a scale value when the user enters values for things
    such as the diameter of a circle.  I'd like to trap when ever the user enters
    a distance for OFFSET or other such values and behind the scenes multiply the
    value they entered.

  body: 'You can certainly respond to events to manipulate geometry etc., although
    not as they pass through the user-input system. You''d be best looking at Database
    events, rather than DocumentCollection or Editor events.


    Some of the events used in <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2006/11/linking_circles.html">this
    series of posts</a> may be of help.

  body: What recommendations could you give to vetoing a command?  I would like to
    veto DDEDIT to open a custom form depending on the contents of a text entity.  It
    would be vetoed when a text entity is double clicked thus providing something
    in Editor.SelectImplied method.

  body: 'Dear qu,


    You might try undefining the SAVEAS command and redefining it with your custom
    behaviour.


    Or you might try to hook into the command-level events and then use some Windows
    API tricks to pump the default you want into the dialog''s edit box.
