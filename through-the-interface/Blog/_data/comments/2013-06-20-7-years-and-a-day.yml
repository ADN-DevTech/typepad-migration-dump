    Congratulations!!


    And Great Thanks for this blog. I’m not a software engineer (civil engineer :-)
    ) but have special interest in programming, so I found your blog very helpful
    to deal with special issues.


    Kind Regards,


    Mourad'

    Needless to say that your blog has become over the years the reference point for
    the development of Autodesk products, just read the posts in the sea of specific
    Forums to find yourself also translated into Chinese.

    Have not always been a bed of roses, some of us it was not always polite, but
    you''ve always been helpful and responsive.


    Thank you, and to the next seven years plus 1 day.
