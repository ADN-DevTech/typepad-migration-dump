    I have been studying your great articles. They have been very helpful in getting
    me up to speed with AutoCAD 2008 .NET. I was wondering if you might know how to
    go about aligning 3d objects? For example you have two cylinders in your drawing
    and they are perpendicular in relation to each other and you want to get them
    where they are collinear so they would share the same axis and their faces would
    be facing each other.

    I know there has to be a TransformBy applied to on of the objects, but setting
    up the matrix correctly is where I am stumped. I still can''t grasp the Matrix3d.


    Thanks Kean!

    That''s an interesting question... I imagine that you''d need to get the solid''s
    faces and the planes of those faces, and then use the geometry libary to calculate
    the transformation(s) needed to make them co-planar. The bad news is that the
    BRep API (which would be needed to traverse the solid''s faces) is not currently
    available in .NET (so you''d need to use at least some C++, for now).


    Sorry not to have better news for you,

    I realize I am pretty late on this post, but here it goes:


    My programmers created an API, in C++ ARX,  that traverses the 3D Solids Exterior
    Loops,

    Interior Loops, and Edges, and then returns:

    The number of faces

    The vertexes of each face

    The area of each face

    The normal and inverse normal of the faces

    The radius values of planer 3d curves

    The cylinder holes

    and a few others


    The API can be accessed from Visual Basic 6, VB.NET, C# and Lisp.


    I am not sure how many programmers would want this API, but I know we really needed
    it. If the demand is there I would consider making it available.

    Are there any options to write/edit eg. Cylinder properties?


    I managed to get more specific Cylinder properties by using the Cylinder.Create()
    Method. This way I can get/set the Radius property, but the Height property throws
    an AccessViolationException.


    I must be doing something wrong, but what would be the correct way?

    Sorry - I''m just getting ready for a trip (I leave for China tomorrow morning),
    so don''t have time to look at this.


    Hopefully you''ll get a response via the discussion group.
