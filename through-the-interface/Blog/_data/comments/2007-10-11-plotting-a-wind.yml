    You can use Point3d directly in P/Invoke where the parameter is an ads_point (note
    the use of the ''out'' param modifier for output params):

    <PRE>

    static extern int acedTrans( Point3d point, IntPtr fromRb, IntPtr toRb, int disp,
    out Point3d result );

    </PRE>'

    In this case it doesn''t really improve the flow of the code, as we need to create
    an Extents2d object from the results. But it''s certainly a good tip for cases
    where Point3ds are to be used afterwards.

    It''s probably because you''re including System.Windows.Forms:


    using System.Windows.Forms;


    Both this and Autodesk.AutoCAD.ApplicationServices include an Application type.
    So you need to disambiguate the use of Application by prefixing the use of Application
    with the relevant namespace (for instance).

    It sounds as though you actually want to modify the view inside the viewport object?


    That''s a different problem than the one solved by this post - you should be able
    to get the Viewport object from the paperspace block table record and manipulate

    A little more info: setting the layout works if the CommandMethod is NOT CommandFlags.Session.
    What I''m writing is a batch plotter which opens a list of dwg files, switches
    to the appropriate layout, and plots, so obviously it needs to be Session. The

    I''m a member of ADN and Wayne Brill there came up with the solution for the JPEG
    plot files coming out empty.  Turns out there''s a "feature" <g> of the plotting
    API that REQUIRES that the points specifying the window be from the upper left
    to the lower right.  I was seeing the problem only with PlotType.Window and PlotRotation.Degrees000.


    The workaround is to pass the user-selected window points through a function that
    calculates the lower left and upper right corners and then create the Extents2d
    object that you pass to PlotSettingsValidator.SetPlotWindowArea() from those points.


    I can send the code Wayne created if that will help, Kean.  This issue might be
    a good addition to a post or KB article.
