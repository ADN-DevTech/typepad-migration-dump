  body: 'Kerry,


    The presenter chose to use VB for this sample. I mostly choose C#, but have, on
    the odd occasional, chosen to use VB. The choice I make is to spend my time focusing
    on generating more content rather than spending time on conversion - I started
    off posting in both languages but soon found it too time-consuming.


    I would hope that the majority of readers would agree with this choice (as otherwise
    my output would reduce: there''s simply no way around that).


    The online tools are generally pretty good. If you know the target environment
    (which you should, given that''s the environment you''re choosing to translate
    into), then you should be able to work out what else needs to be changed pretty
    quickly.


    And if you have trouble, let me know.

    thanks for such good job with your videos. It should take a lot of work, and it''s
    nice to find people just helping others.


    It seems you send the Inspector only by Email, so would you please send it to
    me also. It would be very helpful in the project i''m involved. (replace an old
    lisp tool for autocad 2005 to a brand new .Net tool for autocad 2009)
