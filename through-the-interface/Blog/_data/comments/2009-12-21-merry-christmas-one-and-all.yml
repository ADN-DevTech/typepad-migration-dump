    Try <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2009/01/selecting-the-nearest-face-of-an-autocad-solid-using-net.html">this
    post</a>. You will need to include a project reference to the acdbmgdbrep.dll
    from the appropriate ObjectARX SDK''s include folder.


    I suggest posting your general questions to one of <a href="http://discussion.autodesk.com">the
    online discussion groups</a>.

    I didn&#39;t get the solution. I had run your code but it could select

    only the 3D solid. Now i want the 2D selection. If i click the center

    point then select the nearest face (Like BOUNDARY-&gt;pick pint.

    COMMAND). I need any alternative solution for BOUNDARY command. if you

    have any idea about this please share with me. or you may give any

    reference how to handle it or create it .
