  body: 'Hi Maksim,


    I don''t quite understand your reasoning. Abort kills the underlying unmanaged
    transaction so it sets the AutoDelete flag to false to avoid a double delete if
    Dispose is called. (This also removes the object from the finalizer queue.)


    Can you give me more details what you believe is a problem?


    Thanks,

    albert'

    \ my colleagues on IDisposable implementation of the Transaction object. We were\
    \ actually trying to figure out whether it's safe (in a sense of in-transaction\
    \ instantiated DBROs) to Dispose running Transaction regardless of it's commited/aborted\
    \ state.\n\nRegards,\nMaksim Sestic\n\n  \n \n-----"
