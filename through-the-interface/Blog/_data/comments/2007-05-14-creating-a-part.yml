  body: 'i,m not much familiar with auto cad and doing a research.

    may be this is not related to this article.


    my research is retrieve cad information(objects,dimensions,relationships among
    objects etc...) and store them in RDF file and query RDF to get appropriate information
    by end users.(this research use sementic technology to query cad information,
    which has stored as RDF format)


    other parts of research is ok.but there''s a problem with how to retrieve information
    from cad drawing.so i tried to use VBA code and i could get only OBJECT Names
    like wall,polygon.and i could get object id too. my aim is to code through VBA
    and access it using my C# code.


    i couldn''t find a way to get dimension of objects.may be because of i,m not much
    familiar with cad.(i,m trying this with auto cad Architectural DT 2007 drawing,
    because i read somewhere it treat all things as object and so i thought it will
    be easy to me)


    can anyone help me to retrieve information from cad drawing through VBA code.
    or give me a link which i can find about this.'

    Do you mean the text string to define a POP menu or the macro string to insert

    \ Unloading and reloading \"ACAD\" through AutoCAD's dialog correctly removes\
    \ and replaces the Customization Groups \"CUSTOM\", \"EXPRESSION\" and \"IMPRESSION\"\
    . In C#, however, when I call CuiUnload all four groups disappear, but calling\

    SendStringToExecute is dependent on a document being present, as you''ve found
    out. Your choices are to delay loading your DLL in some way (by using LISP''s
    s::startup, for instance), or to use another way to launch your command, such
    as ads_queueexpr() (see <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2006/08/calling_command.html">here</a>
