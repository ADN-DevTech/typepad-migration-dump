  body: 'Of course this means that you can''t tell if a handle exists in a database
    without catching an exception. You could always PInvoke to acdbHandEnt (which
    I do), but that only works on the current drawing, not any other drawing/database.
    This is really bad if your doing this in a loop (say your auditing a SQL-database
    full of handles against a drawing). Especially if you have a debugger attached.


    It was fine in ObjectARX/C++ when you just checked the return value for the error,
    there wasn''t a significant overhead to doing that. There is with catching an
    exception. This is a perfect example of bad API design.'

    Yes, P/Invoking acdbHandEnt() needs you to set the current document if working
    on different files (you don''t have to make the document active, as I''m sure
    you''re aware).


    Are you seeing a performance impact when compared with calling AcDbDatabase::getAcDbObjectId()
    on a specific database? (Aside from the exception handling question, that is.)'

    I did''t understand if ObjectId or Handle are unique identifier for an object
    in the database in a persistent way or only session limited.


    If I create objects on a DWG file and then save and close this file, when I try
    to re-open that... ObjectId and Handle remains the same?


    Cheers,

    ObjectIds are per session, but get remapped on DWG load from the values stored
    in the file.


    Handles are persistent across sessions.

    but couldn't figure this out. I'll try this out as soon as I get too work. Hopefully
    it will help me save data linked to objects over sessions... :)

  body: 'Hi to all.

    I think that Wyatt''s point of view is performance-prone, that is good, but we
    also keep in mind that custom application related objects in a drawing should
    be managed through our application. If so when we delete an object from model
    space, our application is responsible to do update our SQL db accordingly. The
    Try-Catch-End try statement is just to preserve the crash of our application.


    In other words is our application that should manage the SQL db, in order to mantain
    the db up to date with the drawing.'
