  body: 'Hello, all.  Those who attended my classes last year at AU (AU 2006) received
    a DVD that included a Template for creating VB.NET applications using VB.NET Express.  I
    have since created templates that can be used for creating Jigs (both Draw and
    Entity Jigs) using VB.NET Express Edition.  Look me up this year if you would
    like these templates.


    By the way, nearly all of my classes use VB.NET Express edition - even the Hands-On
    Introduction to VB.NET Labs.


    Take care and I hope to see you at AU 2007.

    If you also would like to automaticly netload your dll in Autocad from Visual
    Basic 2008 .NET then do the following:


    - create a text file in notepad

    - type in : netload ..\bin\Debug\[myclass].dll

    - save the file in you vb project directory as "script.scr"

    - in the vb.net IDE go to you project properties => debug => and type in the ''command
    line arguments'' /b "[path to vb.net project]\script.scr"

    - if you debug your project then the DLL in the debug directory will be netloaded.'

    If I recall correctly, the point is that you need to create the .csproj.user file

    I''m a bit late with this, but we just started to test using C# with autocad.
    We currently use Autocad 2007, but we will update to 2010 or 2011 when we have
    tested and programmed enough code.


    Thanks to this article we managed to get the debugging up and running in Visual
    Studio 2005 Express. (how did you find this out? We''d never found this ourselves!)


    Now, is it normal that autocad is started and closed everytime? Isn''t it possible
    to have autocad open the whole time? This would make our debugging much faster
    and easier.


    Or is this only possible in the professional edition, or maybe in a more recent
    version (2008, that will be needed for Acad 2010/2011)?


    Thanks!'

    We noticed that Class Library projects created using full Visual Studio had debugging
