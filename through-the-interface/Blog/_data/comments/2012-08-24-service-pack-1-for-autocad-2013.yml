    I queued this one up yesterday and then went to bed. The news came in overnight:
    the timing was a bit unfortunate, but hopefully it''ll get reposted soon, in any
    case.

    Are you thought what between quality of a product and volume of its sales there
    is a direct link?

    Lisp + DCL + Unicode + AutoCAD 2013 = Horror.

  body: 'Hi Andrey,


    There was a very specific issue with the Service Pack that has caused it to be
    removed, and it will be reposted once fixed. These things happen (I don''t personally
    see there''s a fundamental problem with quality in AutoCAD or in our Engineering
    processes - if you feel that''s the case, please do make sure ADN is aware of
    your concerns).


    Your primary complaint appears to be regarding the use of the Core Console in
    localized versions. I''m not aware of these issues, but as a tool that''s intended
    to run scripts - and is not end-user focused, in any way - this doesn''t come
    as a huge surprise. Application development inside AutoCAD - for better or worse
    - is more reliably performed via globalised commands. Now I may have missed your
    point - if that''s the case, please do submit your concerns in more detail via
    ADN.


    The recent financial results doesn''t seem in any way related to the quality of
    AutoCAD - if you look into the detail, from a sales perspective you''ll see that
    AutoCAD is actually one of this quarter''s success stories - but I can see how
    it might be tempting to tie these various threads together.


    Regards,

    I hope that it will be decided. :)'
