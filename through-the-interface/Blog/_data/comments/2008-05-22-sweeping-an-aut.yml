  body: 'Hi Kean,


    I really need to be able to programatically create 3dSolids by sweeping along
    mainly helixes and 3d splines. Could you help me with that?

    Maybe you could create a function that gets a region and a path entities as arguments
    and returns the newly created 3dSolid?


    Is that posible?


    If you can do it in VB.NET rather that C# it''ll be even better for me because
    I''m an absolute beginner in C#.


    Thanks a lot for your great blog!'

    <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2010/01/sweeping-an-autocad-solid-using-net.html">Today''s
    post</a> should help, and hopefully <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2009/07/converting-between-c-and-vbnet.html">the
    resources provided here</a> will help convert the code to VB.NET.


    While I haven''t created a separate function to do this, I''d hope you''d be able
    to do that yourself (what you''ve described is quite similar to Solid3d.CreateSweptSolid()
    does, although rather than returning the result this sets the state of the Solid3d
    entity upon which is is called).


    Good luck!

    Is it possible to align an object to a path without executing the sweep command


    Thank you for this useful blog'

    So you want to align a profile without performing the sweep itself? When you say
    "the sweep command" do you mean the command or the operation?

    Yes, if possible I want to do the alignment without executing the sweep operation
    -sorry my mistakes in previous post-.


    For example in 3D coordinate system I have a line, and a circle. I want the circle
    to be rotated so that it perpendicularly aligned with the line


    Thank You

    That''s a fairly straightforward example: you should be able to set the center
    of the circle to be the start-point of the line and its normal to be the  unit
    vector going in the direction between the end-point and the start-point.

  body: 'Hi Kean,


    Finally I successfully done it according to your advise. But, it doesn''t work
    if the line that act as path change to arc, ellipse or spline.


    Well I can do it by doing the sweep operation, explode the object created until
    I get the 2D object.


    But I was wondering is it possible to do it faster, without doing the sweep operation.

    you can get another point along the curve (at dist or at param) and use that for
    the circle''s normal.
