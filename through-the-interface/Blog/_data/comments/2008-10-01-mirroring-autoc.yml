    I created something similar using your example above. I am iterating thru all
    entities in a database then mirroring them. I there a way to not have the text
    itself mirror. I set mirrtext property to 0 but it still mirrors the text itself.


    Thanks,


    Ed'

    When you open each entity you will need to check whether it''s a DBText or MText
    you''re dealing with (depending on what you care about), and then choose whether
    or not to mirror it.


    You might want to check the IsMirroredInX and/or IsMirroredInY properties on the
    DBText class, to help with this decision.

  body: 'Hi Kean,

    It seems that there is an annoying bug to mirroring entities by this method,

    1- draw a closed polyline and mirror it by this method.

    2- type pe in command line to edit polyline select mirrored poly and type E, by
    default autocad should show a X shape on each vertex by pressing enter but X icon
    is not correctly on polyline vertex! am I right?

    Why? and what is the solution?

    (tested it in Autocad 2010 using VS2008)'

    I don''t have time to investigate this issue (and I don''t believe it''s specific
    to my code, although it''s possible it might be).


    Please post the issue via standard channels (whether to <a href="http://adn.autodesk.com">the
    ADN team</a> or <a href="http://discussion.autodesk.com/forums/forum.jspa?forumID=152">the
    AutoCAD .NET Discussion Group</a>).

    This has been a very useful post for me as a new AutoCAD developer taking over
    projects from other devs.

    That being said, did you ever write that post regarding mirroring text?


    That''s my big hangup at the moment.


    Thanks for the helpful posts

    Strange - I was sure I''d responded to this, but it seems the comment didn''t
    go through.


    I was saying that I''d ask Philippe if he''d found time to put something together
    (and I made some quip about it only being 5 years since I published the post,
    and that it might take some more time... ;-).


    Anyway, Philippe responded very quickly by posting this over on the AutoCAD DevBlog:

    I hope this helps,
