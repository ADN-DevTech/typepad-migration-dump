    I was thinking that if you''re going to automate a prime number finder, you should
    save memory by using points on the number line instead of circles. Then you would
    look for points on top of each other. It would be interesting to see what limit
    AutoCAD reaches. Now, here is the problem, after you get past your largest "circle
    with its left quadrant on the origin", prime numbers occur where you have "no
    points" on the line (unless you include "size 1" points, then you will have just
    that point).


    If you are able to make CAD tell you where you have only one point in space instead
    of many, you''d get the same result as looking for circle intersections but using
    a lot less information to do it.


    Does that make sense?'

  body: 'Hi Carlos,


    Thanks! :-)


    I''m actually quite happy with the idea of counting circles at unit locations
    along the X-axis... for sure it could all be done with points, but it''s so much
    less pretty. ;-)


    With the approach I''m following (looking for 4 intersecting circles at that location)
    then I''m only going to reliably find primes up to the limit of the largest circle,
    but I think that''s OK for my purposes. I''d have to tweak to look for less after
    that point, but I''m probably not going to take this to the extent of testing
    the maximum reachable (although perhaps an interested reader will take it that
    extra step or two).


    I''ll post more on Monday, in case.


    Thanks for stopping by!
