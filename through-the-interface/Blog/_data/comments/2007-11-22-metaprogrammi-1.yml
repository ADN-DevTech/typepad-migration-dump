    \ come across many situations where the ability to evaluate and execute code represented\
    \ as a string was useful.\n\nI have done my share of 'metaprogramming' in AutoLISP\
    \ (and also with the formalization of metaprogramming in Common LISP - defmacro),\
    \ but none of that involved manipulating source code in string form.\n\nPerhaps\
    \ you could show or cite a practicle example of where evaluating and executing\
    \ code stored as a string is useful to AutoCAD programmers?\n\nThanks,\nTony"

    The instances I''ve encountered this are typically when code fragments are stored
    in a DWG or an external database, to be retrieved and executed as needed.


    Let me refer you to the comment that started this topic off, as that may help.
