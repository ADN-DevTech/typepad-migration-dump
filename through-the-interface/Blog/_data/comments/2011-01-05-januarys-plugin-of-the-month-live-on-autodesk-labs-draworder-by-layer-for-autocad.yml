  body: It would be nice to be able to save and call up a 'standard' draw order list
    to process.  Also, a reactor to process this 'standard list' prior to the plot
    command would also make this invaluable.  I'll try to take a stab at these.

  body: Will this work on xref layers as well?  Wildcards?

  body: 'My understanding is that it will not (as we restrict our selection of layers
    to those in modelspace). But then I haven''t tried it, specifically.


    I''m not even sure how draw-order is meant to work with the contents of xrefs,
    to be honest.

  body: 'I haven''t looked at the plugin, but draw-order for xrefs works much the
    same as it does for other BlockReferences.  The host drawing has a BlockTableRecord
    for the xref which has a DrawOrderTable.  That DrawOrderTable is the same as the
    xref''s modelspace DrawOrderTable, which means that the xref''s draw-order is
    honored in the host drawing.


    You can change the xref''s BTR just like any other BTR, including modifying it''s
    DrawOrderTable.  It will affect what you see in the host drawing, but it won''t
    persist past the next xref reload.


    Some changes that you can make in the host drawing''s BTR for an xref may prevent
    refedit from working until the xref is reloaded [erasing entities, for example.]  Modifying
    the DrawOrderTable doesn''t seem to affect refedit, though.'

  body: 'I do something similar, but not based on layers.


    I recommend that you use the PlotReactorManager events (in the Autodesk.AutoCAD.PlottingServices
    namespace) because you''ll catch the plot, publish, and preview commands.  You''ll
    also catch plotting techniques that aren''t command-based, such as those used
    by the Sheet Set Manager.


    I use the PlotReactorManager.BeginPage event to enforce draw order per-layout.'
