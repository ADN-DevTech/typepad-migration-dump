  body: 'That''s really strange: I converted the project to VS 2008 and it compiles
    just fine on my system (with neither errors nor warnings).


    Can you help with some steps I might follow to reproduce this problem?


    [An easy workaround is to assign the variable during its declaration, of course:


    Point3d closest = new Point3d();


    But I''d rather understand the issue before making this change in the next version.]


    Thanks,
