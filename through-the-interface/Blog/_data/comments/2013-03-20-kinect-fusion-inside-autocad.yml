    \ be much cheaper than most solutions, and perhaps a higher geek factor. Granted\
    \ the point clouds might not be as dense and accurate, but for spatial capturing,\
    \ internals, and energy modeling it might just be enough.\n\nCheers,\nShaan"

    To do real-time capture with Kinect Fusion you need a fairly well-spec''ed system
    with a beefy GPU. You can drop back down to CPU-only mode if implementing a system
    that doesn''t need to be real-time capable (e.g. a 3D photo-booth).


    I''m not at all sure how that fits in with the Surface Pro''s specs, I have to
    admit (don''t know enough about it). If you have one to send me, I''ll give a
    try! ;-)

    I have to admit this is amazing. Would work great in conjunction with our Faro
    scanner :), talk about detailed areas. Personally I do have a Surface Pro, but
    highly doubt the system would be able to handle it with only a Core i5 and the
    integrated Intel graphics; however, a decent laptop with a beefed up mobile GPU
    (i.e. an nVidia Quadro), I don''t see why this would not work for a "compact"
    mobile real-time scanning solution. Maybe I will pull my Kinect and make an attempt
    as I do want to see what my Pro is really capable of doing.'

    How does the Kinect sensor know its location? It must, so when you move it, the
    points are correctly "georeferenced".

    Maybe your new tagline should be "I''m bringin Geeky back." Amazing connections
    you are doing.'

    But yes - it''s indeed all very clever. :-)

    Thanks for the kind words.


    I copied the DLL from "C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Kinect\Developer Toolkit
    v1.7.0\Redist\amd64" into the same folder as the DLL you NETLOAD into AutoCAD
    (as far as I recall).


    I hope this helps,

    It depends what you mean by "Initialize KinectFusion". You need to create a reconstruction
    volume - as you can see in StartSensor(), above - and then this will get populated.

    The problem is calling getVertices() after creating the mesh failed for unknown

  body: 'Hi Kean,

    Newbie here.  From the Kinect Fusion videos I''ve watched, their reconstruction
    algos works well.  I thought a point cloud was an intermediate step on the way
    to a reconstruction.  If that is the case, why request the point cloud from the
    reconstruction, rather than the reconstructed mesh?  Does AutoCAD for some reason
    need the point clouds (a.k.a. vertices, a.k.a. voxels) instead of a mesh (a.k.a.
    faces, polygons or surfaces)?  I must be missing something.


    By the way, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzb_RQWrt6I">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzb_RQWrt6I</a>
    is a good video which explains the reconstruction algo, which Microsoft graciously
    published.

    Simple: AutoCAD deals less well with multi-million vertex meshes than it does
    with point clouds. And (secondarily) the tools for working with point clouds inside
    AutoCAD are improving steadily, release on release.


    Thanks for the link!
