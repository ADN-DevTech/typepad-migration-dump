  body: 'your post made me think, is there a tool that tells you what files are being
    loaded at startup?

    While some parts of that would be easy, a bunch of findfiles (using lisp lets
    say) looking for known files acad loads on startup for a given version.

    What about menu mnl''s, and other items that get loaded by startup lisps (say,
    acaddoc.lsp)?

    The tool would basically watch for the loading of .lsp, vba, .arx, .dll and so
    on. This has been asked in DG''s many times. Is this a tool you could try to make?
    The resulting list of files would be a great diagnostic tool.

    thx'

    exactly this information. It not only tells you what processes are loading, but
    (and this is almost more important) trying to load and from where.

    to using it more as a primary OS."


    Perhaps you''re referring to the Aesthetic aspects?

  body: 'Not solely, Tony, although I admit I like them. Here''s a more balanced review
    of the OS, in case you''re interested:

    I generally prefer to form my own opinions on these things (I''ve been using Windows
    8 on-and-off during the developer and consumer preview releases - it''s a rock
    solid OS), but if I''m going to trust an online opinion it''s almost certainly
    not that of USA Today (especially not for technology coverage - I mean, seriously?).

  body: 'Well, I''m not so naive as to trust anything coming from sources that are
    primarily in the business of reviewing products (who in many cases keep the products
    they''re sent for review), and have a significant dependence on revenues derived
    from paid advertising from the companies whose products they review.


    USA Today doesn''t seem to be up to its eyeballs in conflicting interests, so
    while they may not have the same level of technical expertise, they are simply
    conveying the reactions and opinions of both IT professionals and plain everyday
    consumers.'

  body: 'The opinion I''ve formed of the newspaper in question (over years of it being
    forced upon me during trips to the US) is that it''s a tabloid dressed up as serious
    journalism that has a nasty habit of presenting snippets of facts without broader
    context.


    I think it''s bold to assume they don''t serve their own vested interests, even
    if those are to sell more copies or advertising via sensationalist journalism.


    Anyway - I''m not naively trusting anything like a review (even if it happens
    to provide more depth and balance - the Gizmodo review is far from being one-sidedly
    positive, which is why I chose that: it''s easy enough to choose a position and
    find a review that fits it).


    I''ve used the OS and I personally like it a great deal. Whether it proves popular
    or not isn''t hugely relevant to me. I''ll be switching across to use it full-time
    when I get the chance.
