  body: "This is interesting stuff.  I have been pondering getting into web services\
    \ for awhile and it is great that you are going through consuming the service\
    \ in AutoCAD.\n\nAm I right in my conclusion with this that I can abstract any\
    \ common business logic into a web service and then consume it in AutoCAD, Android,\
    \ iOS, etc fairly easily?\n\nI would like to create a line-of-business database\
    \ and then use this information in different ways.  For example create a database\
    \ that contains all the information on hardware etc for a project, then use this\
    \ information in AutoCAD for creating drawings and also access it in a Android\
    \ app to easily access a BOM and related documentation in the field.  \n\nThe\
    \ example you are showing is going to be the AutoCAD part of this, and when I\
    \ go to develop the Android part the service should be ready to go and I only\
    \ need to use Android tools to consume it rather than program all the business\
    \ logic in another platform?\n\nAs a slightly different angle on this, does it\
    \ mean that I could have AutoCAD running on a computer that is running a web service\
    \ I create and use this service to drive AutoCAD.  An example would be if there\
    \ was a standard drawing template and you had an app on a phone that you could\
    \ specify all of the variables for this template.  Then the app calls the web\
    \ service which generates the drawing on the computer hosting the service and\
    \ then email it to the phone in pdf format?\n\nI am thinking this could open up\
    \ all sorts of interesting mobile / desktop / server interaction using services\
    \ that can easily be accessed by any platform.  I am sure from what I read this\
    \ was technically feasable before, but with the new API you mention it looks like\
    \ this may have got much simpler."

    made easier with the ASP.NET Web API.


    So yes, I think this series will be interesting to you. :-)

    I overlooked an important point:


    Thank you for spending the time and effort to post all this information.  I find
    all your posts very usefull and it makes learning this stuff much easier, you
    break the topics down in a way that works well to understand and learn.  It is
    appreciated!'

    I dislike learning something (often painfully) if it doesn''t end up saving someone
    else some pain. Something about trees falling in forests and all that. :-)
