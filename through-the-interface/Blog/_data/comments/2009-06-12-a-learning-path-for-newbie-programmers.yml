  body: "Ramp up is indeed a great start for Microsoft technologies, but can be very\
    \ overwelming if you dont know what you're looking for. \n\nIn my opinion, people\
    \ starting to program with AutoCAD should have notice or skills in following subjects:\n\
    \n- Knowing what .NET is about, what COM/Interop is, so a very broad overview\
    \ of .NET technology.\n- Knowing bacics on programming and OOP: classes, types,\
    \ value & reference types etc, etc...\n- Knowing how to do user interaction =>\
    \ Winforms/WPF, Events etc.\n\nThose are the very basics of programming and the\
    \ least you should know (imo :)\n\nSo when applied to AutoCAD programming they\
    \ can get into the events, palettes, commands and logic pretty quickly.\n\nI'll\
    \ look into what I've bookmarked on basics, but anyway, there are plenty of free\
    \ resources around on .NET."

  body: 'I''ve only taken one programming class, 12 years ago, as an elective to my
    drafting courses. It was in C. I barely remembered it when I got into programming
    VLISP after attending CAD Camp in 2005 (Lynn Allen was really great at explaining
    it to everyone in a way that I could understand). After that, I learned by reading
    the help files that came with AutoCAD/Civil 3D. When I moved to VBA, which was
    harder for me to grasp, I only read the help as I needed to know what I was trying
    to do at that time. The intellisense really helped me grope my way thru the first
    few routines I made.

    I tried to make a few palette based apps in 2006/2007, using Visual Basic Express
    2005 and a trial of the Visual Studio 2005. Again, I only used the help files
    as I needed, and the online library in VS05 helped alot.

    However, in the past year, I''ve only worked on one application, stand alone from
    AutoCAD, a basic project management tool that I use to track project numbers and
    status in an xml file that I stylized and embedded on my desktop. I use VSE08
    for that app, since it has the better handling of xml than previous versions.
    I''ll tell you, using VSE08 is so much easier than the xml reader I wrote in VLISP
    4 years ago.'

  body: I found that examples are extremely useful in getting stuff to work. Learning
    VBA was relatively painless because there are many examples available. Programming
    vb.NET has been much more challenging because of the lack of examples. Making
    it more difficult is having a blend of COM and .NET objects (working in Civil
    3D), which makes it hard since there are few examples of comingling the code.
    For instance you can access a AECCSurface as a COM object and a .NET object, but
    the .NET object doesn’t have all of the properties and methods of the COM object.

  body: 'One of the more recent discoveries I''ve made is Design Patterns.  These
    may be a little challenging for beginners, but are an important part of developing
    applications.  I have an Architecture background and have picked up programming
    on my own.  So this is one of the things that programmers probably get early on
    in their education, but I''d never even heard of until recently.


    Also, by seeing examples that you''ve posted and some of the labs I''ve attended,
    coding style seems very similar and uses techniques that I wouldn''t have picked
    up on my own.  One example is passing ObjectIDs as parameters to functions instead
    of the actual object.  Maybe there''s some reason for this beyond what I would
    pick up on my own.  What are your top 5 or 10 best practices for developing applications
    on top of AutoCAD?  Using transactions, etc...


    IMHO, these are necessary for beginners to learn and I wish I''d had these lessons
    earlier.  Actually, I still need them.  ;-)


    Thanks for taking on this project!'

  body: 'Hi Kean,


    I''ve been following your blog for a few months now and like the stuff you do,
    you show us things that are useful and relevent to my profession. I do not know
    how to program, but I am very keen to learn so I might be able to make my drafting
    easier and more effective. Since we are a small firm here in Australia (Tasmania)
    we do not have much resources for training, and self training is a must for me.


    If im stuck with a problem that I need to resolve, I search the AutoCAD help files
    and the Autodesk forums. I have found them a very useful tool. Apart from buying
    lots of books on the subject matter that im looking into, I find a small amount
    of information (free) and then work on trying to teach myself.


    So I guess, the best material that you could possibly provide is some basic knowledge
    and then get the readers to try and do it themself, and use free tools from the
    internet, until they think it is worthwhile to buy some better software.


    So thankyou for providing your blog to us the readers, keep up the good work,
    and I look forward to seeing the training material in the future.

    You''re correct, design patterns are a bit much for a beginner, but I like your
    other suggestions, inheritance, encapsulation, other OO techniques.  While anyone
    can program poorly, I do it all the time ;-), having good structure to your programs
    is essential even for short ones like the ones you post.  There must be a reason
    that even the shortest apps will likely have multiple functions or multiple classes
    in them.  What are some basic decisions to I should have to make about my application''s
    structure?  (No need to answer here)


    Now, I need to go look up TDD, Unit testing, DDD...


    Thanks again.'

    couple of years mainly for public utilities network digitizing and administration.  Actually
    i''m really interested in developing internal applications like such made with
    ObjectARX or .NET.  It looks very useful and easier to follow the .net path but
    i have read that only with the C++ ARX approach is it possible to create customized
    objects.  It is still true ? if so i will take the C++ path, but if not i''d really
    like to follow the .NET solution to build my present and future projects.

    There are not enough materials nor books available for this subjects.  There is
    a book of ObjectARX but it is a little bit out of date (Jan 19 2000).


    Thanks a lot !!

    AutoCAD 2010 introduces the <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/overrules/">Overrule
    API</a> for .NET, which goes a long way to eliminating the need for custom objects

    I strongly recommend against adopting custom objects (which are *really* hard
    to develop), if you can avoid it.

  body: 'Hi


    Greetings from New Zealand


    I am a Civil Engineer and did a final year project in programming excel with VBA
    to do structural engineering calculations this got me started in VBA which I used
    a lot in the first couple of years of my career with MS office products.


    Due to a lack of drafting staff in our industry I started to program Autocad to
    automate a lot of basic tasks.


    Since then I have just read a lot and as mentioned by others I find code examples
    the best help as once you understand the code synatax and IDE you can usually
    figure out whats to be done and use the code examples as the base to start with.


    I have just started programming a little bit in vb.net with Civil3d using a really
    good AU paper from 2007 as an intro and the vb.net book mentioned earlier. But
    the lack of shipped .net examples makes things a bit slower.
