    The photos are very nice.I have viewed many of your post.Everything is very intresting.Now
    i would like to ask you that to post an item showing how to get the vertexs of
    2d solid  to create a boundary,

    could you add one which shows exporting the entity to other format like .shp.?,


    Thank you ,

    I''ve put some code together that I''ll post tomorrow.


    When you say .SHP - do you mean the AutoCAD .SHP format or ESRI''s ShapeFile format?


    I''ll show how to create boundary poylines from the boundaries: you should be
    able to work out how to use the vertex data from there.


    Regards,
