  body: Given a selection within an in-place editor, how do you set the font?... Not
    the font on the style... the font on the selection within the editor... or, how
    do you get the index number of a specific named font through AutoCAD?

    Having said that, I''m not sure I understand the question.


    What do you mean by "10 to 10 units from the startpoint"?


    And what points do you need - vertices or points on the polyline?

    how to test whether a point is inside a polyline (it''s a bit complicated, from
    what I remember). If it isn''t there, please ask them for it.
