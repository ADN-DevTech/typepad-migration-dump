  body: 'Thanks for the example, and yes I was mistaken about history for API-generated
    solids.


    That was an assumption on my part, partly because I expected SetDatabaseDefaults()
    to take care of that (using the current value of the SOLIDHIST system variable
    in the owning database).


    Now if you wouldn''t mind, please demonstrate how to change the height or radius
    of an existing cylinder primitive with history :-)'

    I''m checking with Engineering to see whether anything related to this has changed
    with the work done for the freeform modeling feature.

  body: Kean, you have touched a very noticeable topic. If I set RecordHistoty On
    and combine (unite or subtract) two solids then I get a new solid without editing
    grips though PROPERTIES palette still shows RecordHistory On. Are there any ideas
    to overcome this? With or without API?

  body: 'Nikolay,


    I assume this means that history can be recorded for such a composite solid, but
    AutoCAD isn''t able to determine how best to show grips for the new solid (or
    allow grip editing).


    I don''t have any suggestions on how to change this behaviour, I''m afraid.

    Sorry - I don''t know of a way to do that with the currently exposed APIs.

  body: 'Hello every one for the same problem that i posted on autoCAD Discussion
    Group <a href="http://discussion.autodesk.com/forums/thread.jspa?threadID=715715&tstart=0">
    Cylinder (C# code) Vs Cylinder (AutoCAD).</a>


    Problem little bit different but related to this post. Actually RecordHistory
    is workin fine for Built-in entities like Culinder, Box, Torus etc.

    But now problem is like when u create solid object using extrude/revolve API of
    C# we can not modify by setting RecordHistory to true.


    I am posting code snippet on which i was working..


    thanks'

    It sounds as though you need an introduction to ObjectARX training. I suggest
    working through the material available on <a href="http://autodesk.com/developautocad">the
    AutoCAD Developer Center</a>.
