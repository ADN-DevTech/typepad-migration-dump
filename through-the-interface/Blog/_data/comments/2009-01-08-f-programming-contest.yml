  body: 'Most Autodesk applications have the ability to load plugins exposing either
    .NET or COM interfaces, depending.


    AutoCAD-based applications (AutoCAD Architecture, AutoCAD Map 3D, AutoCAD Civil
    3D, AutoCAD Mechanical, AutoCAD Electrical, AutoCAD P&ID, and some I may be missing)
    will all be able to load and run the AutoCAD-related F# applications I''ve posted
    here, and all have their own .NET and COM that can in some way be called, too
    (although AutoCAD Electrical is mostly LISP-based, which may make it more tricky).


    There are instructions <a href="http://www.pdcode.com/docs/Inventor_AddIn_FS.html">here</a>
    on writing an F# application for Inventor, and my friend and colleague Jeremy
    is currently <a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/f/"> doing the
    same for Revit</a>.


    I don''t know whether 3ds Max, Maya or XSI have the ability to host .NET plugins,
    however.
