    I don''t see why not. If wanting to load a CUIX on startup, I strongly suggest
    also looking into the Autoloader.

  body: 'Hi Kean, Thank you very much!! Its a very interesting tool! I read the customization
    guide.


    But I have a question, my plugin has two .dll files. One for autocad 2012 and
    another for autocad 2013. I have to create a .bundle folder for each version,
    or is there some way to load each .dll file only in the correct version of autocad,
    with them in the same folder.


    With my current installer (I made from your tutorial) I create registry entries
    specific to each version.

    PS Sorry for my English. I''m from Brazil.'

    Sorry, I realized that I can place multiple components blocks in the same .xml
    file, after watched the video about the autoloader in your blog, thank you for
    your attention.

    Your blog is very good, and help me so much.
