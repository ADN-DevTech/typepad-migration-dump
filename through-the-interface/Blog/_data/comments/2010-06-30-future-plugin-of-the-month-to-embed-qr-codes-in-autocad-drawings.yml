    This is a great innovation I guess and far from being a gadget. I can see a bright
    future for visual codes in CAD drawings (as soon as we will be able to use standardized
    format)'

  body: "Hi Kean,\n\nThis looks really interesting, and, as I've said in the past\
    \ (regarding other Plugin of the month posts), it would I think be of benefit\
    \ in Inventor 2011 onwards.\n \nWhich is doable, because if you were to create\
    \ these QR Codes as native AutoCAD geometry, and then store them as a block, they\
    \ could easily be inserted into Inventor .idw drawing files?\n\nHow useful would\
    \ it be to my specific line of work? I'm not entirely sure; as these codes can\
    \ be read by anyone with a fairly recent internet-enabled camera-phone, it seems\
    \ to me that the information encoded within them could be viewed in one of two\
    \ frames-of-mind:\n\nIt's either non-specific so that only we would know what\
    \ it means. For internal record keeping/Document Control/QA purposes etc.\n\n\
    OR\n\nIt becomes a way of showing off to those in the know just what is possible\
    \ these days.\n\nEither way, I think it's something that I would personally make\
    \ use of once it's available.\n\nThanks,\n\nAlex."

  body: This could be very useful for manufacturing companies that use this barcode
    format in their operations. I.e. for pulling up CNC programs. An example would
    be, custom machining work orders.

  body: 'I recently wrote an Autocad plug-in in Lisp to create QR codes based on Solid
    entities.


    Right now, I''m too lazy to write the whole algorithm to generate the Qrcode in
    AutoCAD. I have modified an existing PHP script so that instead of an image, it
    returns a sequence of 1 and 0 which is then easy to convert to vector graphics.

    It works well, but it''s quite dirty and needs curl exe files.

    I''ll post the code as soon as soon as I''ll have it cleaned.

    There appear to be a number of open source libraries out there to generate QR
    Codes locally... the question I''m still asking myself is whether it''s worth
    building in. I do like the idea of relying on a trustworthy external service (such
    as Google''s), as I know it will be updated as the QR technology evolves.


    I''m also not yet convinced of the benefits of having individual entities vs.
    a single raster image (although interop with other products may be tip the balance
    - I still need to check how the DWGs with embedded raster QR Codes look inside
    Inventor, for instance).

    \ off more than ever, It is a no brainer that this needs to \nbe incorporated\

    \ for sometime for security purposes. What I would love to see happen is to have\
    \ this plug-in AutoGenerate with checkmark options of all the criteria described\

    \ Furthermore I would incorporate this into Autocad WS, In which I can upload\
    \ to my WS foldercreating a link to the online file as well as embedding that\
    \ link into the QR code that can be available to parties with proper passcode\
    \ verification.I would like it to be able to also creat a secondary QR code that\
    \ is customizable specifically for my companies contact information. Seperating\
    \ thesetwo would be crucial. One for vcard or mecard contact info and the other\
    \ for Drawing download and data information. This could be a very easily incorporatedidea,\

  body: 'Interesting: so you''d want the QR code to auto-generate as the base information
    in the drawing was modified?


    You could probably do this via some notification events without too much trouble
    (the source is all there for you to take and extend).
