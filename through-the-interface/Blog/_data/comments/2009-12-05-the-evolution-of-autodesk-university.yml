  body: It felt much smaller in attendance but I agree the vitural side went extermly
    well. I sort of liked the Viniatian better for holding the event just because
    of the walk from the rooms to the conference but overall it was an awesome event
    and more then worth the cost.

  body: 'This was my second time I have been fortunate enough to attend Autodesk University
    and it was great! I''ve heard that the on-site attendance was approximately half
    of what it was in 2008. Still it felt very full.


    I have to say that I prefer the Mandalay to the Venetian facilities. I felt that
    the overall service and quality of the facility were far better. The one comment
    I would make is that the Venetian conference rooms were larger so every one of
    them had tables instead of the Manadalay''s row seating. I also liked the food
    more. Food is important stuff.


    As for the actual conference I noticed something very interesting. I ran into
    so many first time attendees it seemed that almost half of the crowd was new.
    My instructors were almost 50% first-year speakers also. I felt as if this really
    contributed to the overall attitude of the crowd. With the budget cuts taken by
    so many firms it was obvious that everyone who was in attendance really appreciated
    being there. Last year it seemed as if several people were there as a chore.


    Before I ramble further I will just say that this AU was by far better than 2008''s
    AU. Well it was for me at least. That has to count for something and I can''t
    wait to see you all next year.
