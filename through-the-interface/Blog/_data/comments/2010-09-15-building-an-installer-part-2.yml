  body: To install for all users, use the Local machine hive.  The structure mirrors
    the current user hive for installation. Also, the local machine should be used
    to register ribbon controls.

  body: 'Perhaps I could have been more clear: I understand how the Registry works,
    in that respect - and the RegDL tool has an /hklm option to write its details
    there - it''s just that even when writing to HKLM we need to query HKCU to find
    out which was the most recently executed version of AutoCAD: HKLM doesn''t contain
    that information in a CurVer property.


    Otherwise we would have to jump through significant hoops to iterate keys and
    provide a UI asking the user to select one or more specific AutoCAD versions -
    not something that was in scope for this tool.


    While calling "RegDL xxx.dll /hklm" works fine from a command prompt, when running
    from an installer it has trouble as it doesn''t appear to be able to access HKCU
    for the CurVer property (at least that''s what I''m assuming - there''s certainly
    a null reference exception). I''m looking into this further, but wanted to get
    this out there for people to comment on.

  body: I should've realized from the code that you understood that. ;)  Since I'm
    having to install ribbon controls,  I've stopped checking for the latest version,
    and just installing for all versions.

    You''ll need to research (and thoroughly test)this, as it''s not my core area
    of expertise, but I would expect updating the version GUID to help.
