    plug-in does.


    - When you copy objects to the clipboard, AutoCAD also places a bitmap and a metafile
    on the clipboard.


    - The SAVEIMG command saves the current viewport to a .BMP file. No need to ask
    for a window to clip, as it''s a simple matter to pan/zoom to establish that before
    running the command.


    - Shift+PRTSC copies an image of the entire application window to the clipboard.'

    Yes, you can paste a bitmap after having copied objects, although it takes the
    standard background colour, irrespective, and doesn''t appear to work in 3D (from
    the tests I''ve done). And there isn''t much control over the boundaries you''re
    capturing, although it''s nice that you can just get the objects you select (which
    is not something this app does), as long as you don''t mind cropping down from
    the size of the drawing view.


    Shift+PRTSC picks up the entire desktop, as far as I''m aware, so some manual
    clipping is often needed (in my experience, at least - I may be missing something).


    Anyway - I''m happy to hear from people if they feel this plugin concept is less
    than compelling (or what we could do to make it more so).

    1. Great idea - will go ahead and add that.

    2. I actually chose to interpret your original comment in a way that led to the
    path of least resistance. :-) I thought you might want a pure monochrome image,
    but also felt that starting with a white background might be very useful for people
    who wanted to print to a black & white device without ending up with a grey background.
    And as you say: I also think this is going to help people who want to email/document
    things (where a white background is common/desirable). We''ll see. Anyway, in
    terms of addressing the need for a black foreground... the simplest may actually
    be to manipulate the bitmap, forcing any non-white pixel to be black (or using
    the luminosity to decide a greyscale value). That would certainly be simpler than
    modifying geometry. I''ll have a think about that.


    Thanks for all your input, Mark. I really appreciate your feedback, it''s helping
    a lot.

    I suspect there''s a way to get your VB application working with the latest release.
    If it''s actually VB<strong>A</strong> then you probably need to <a href="http://www.autodesk.com/vba-download">download
    the VBA Enabler for AutoCAD 2010</a>.


    With regards to moving from VBA to VB.NET, I recommend looking at <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2009/04/devtv-autocad-vba-to-net-migration-basics.html">this
    DevTV session</a> and the material on the newly re-designed <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vbasic/default.aspx">VB
    Developer Center</a> on MSDN.
