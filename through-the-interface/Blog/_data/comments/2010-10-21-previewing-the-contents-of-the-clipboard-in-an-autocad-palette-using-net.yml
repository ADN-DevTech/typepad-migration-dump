  body: It is just incredible. This is great to know that clipboard includes the images
    and also store the items for use in between autocad sessions as well. I am getting
    to be very excited about it. Let me try first..:-)

  body: '"understanding how AutoCAD places its data on the clipboard would hopefully
    allow us to load it into a Database and then create a thumbnail from it"


    I know this is kind of an old post, and you didn''t go this route, but do you
    know of an API that allows creating a bitmap thumbnail from drawing data in some
    simple fashion like this? Specifically, given a C# BlockReference I''m trying
    to do some sort of BitBlt operation and get out something I can put in a ListView
    ImageList...


    I''ve gone over the BlockReference and base class methods and searched the documentation
    for "bitmap" and nothing looks promising.'

    Long story short, using BlockView and a little of the render to file stuff at
    <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2007/04/rendering_autoc.html">http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2007/04/rendering_autoc.html</a>
    , I got it working (well enough for proof-of-concept demo purposes anyway, which
    is all I was after).'
