  body: Hi Kean, Firstly, congratulations on the 5 Year anniversary. And secondly,
    is there any Autodesk documentation that deals with aspects of Intellectual Property
    and Copyright in relation to code published on your blog (and others)? Thanks,
    Dale

  body: Slight correction Kean - This DevCast episode is relevant to anyone wanting
    to create an installer to deploy their own autoloader bundle (outside Exchange
    Apps). For the store, we will create the installer for you if you use the autoloader
    format. (That way we ensure a common user experience).

  body: 'Thanks, Dale!


    I don''t know of any such documentation, other than what I''ve placed in my "About"
    page.


    I publish code here with the explicit intention for people to use it in their
    applications (without recognition or implied warranty).


    If someone were to publish it on their own blog as their own work (for instance),
    I might get a bit concerned, though.


    Regards,


    Kean'

  body: "Hello Kean,\nThanks for the movie! \nA short remark - The plugin folder MUST\
    \ end on \".bundle\" or AutoCAD 2012 will not import the plugin. I tried some\
    \ of my plugins with different folder names wandering what is going wrong and\
    \ at the end I have just decided to add a \".bundle\" just to watch it instantly\
    \ imported into AutoCAD 2012 . That will save other programmers some time.\n\n\
    Correct me if I am wrong but I did not hear this mentioned in the movie. I may\
    \ be wrong of course.\n\nBest regards!"

  body: 'Thanks for pointing that out. I think it was mentioned in the various guides,
    but I haven''t gone through them exhaustively.


    It''s good you''ve highlighted it, in case someone else hits it.
