    Great, thank you very much for that! The 2010 version of CopySourceAsHTML will
    be of great use to me too in the very near future :-)


    Best regards from Jeddah,

  body: 'Still waiting for EnC (Edit & Continue) support in 64bit.  From what I understand
    you can set VS2010 to x86 to enable EnC but a lot of good that does when you''re
    running inside a 64bit ACAD.


    <i>Anyone know if it''s possible to EnC in VS2010 and 64bit AutoCAD?</i>'

  body: 'This one <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2011/03/making-autocad-less-noisy-when-debugging.html">came
    up recently</a>. I wasn''t aware of the issue (as I a) don''t use Edit & Continue
    and b) am currently on Vista 32-bit), but did enough research to work out that
    it''ll be like that until the successor to VS2010.


    The other option would be to code/debug against a 32-bit AutoCAD build, which
    won''t install onto x64 (unless you manage to get a vertical that doesn''t yet
    have a native port, which I believe they now all do).

    What are the determining factors in your upgrade decision?'

  body: 'Hi Mark,


    A few factors:


    * I installed a second internal hard-drive in my Vista machine, which meant I
    finally had enough disk space for it.

    * I''m keen to fool around with the Async CTP, which is only available for VS2010/.NET
    4.

    * Cost was not a factor: I have a VS subscription, so had the install just sitting
    there, already.

    * Something additional you''ll see in tomorrow''s post. :-)


    Cheers,


    Kean'

  body: 'The edit and continue issue is truly a bit annoying... I also experienced
    other debugging issues when 1st moving to VS 2010 - they went away after installing
    SP1. Therefore, I''d like to point out something I read concerning the Async CTP,
    this is from Microsoft.com:


    "Please be aware that installing Visual Studio 2010 SP1 Beta will break the Visual
    Studio Async CTP. We are looking at options for an updated release that will make
    the Visual Studio Async CTP compatible with Visual Studio 2010 SP1. In the meanwhile
    if you need to work with the CTP you should use Visual Studio 2010 RTM."


    The currently published service pack is no longer a beta, but the MS recommendation
    above hasn''t been removed.

    I installed SP1 on Friday and the Async CTP yesterday, without noticing the warning
    you''ve mentioned. Hopefully they updated one or the other, in the meantime, to
    make them work together.


    Nothing seems to be broken - as yet - but then I haven''t started trying any Async-specific
    code, either (and the "break" could well be more subtle but just as painful).

    It certainly makes me wonder how smelly my code is. :-)
