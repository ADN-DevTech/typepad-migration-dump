  body: 'A question about the overrule.

    Is there anyway to apply overrule to entity instance?

    If Overrule is only applied to entity type. We still need custom entity, otherwise
    all the lines in the drawing will be pipes, as in this example.


    Thanks much.'

  body: 'A great question. You can certainly check instance-related information to

    I''ll put a quick post together demonstrating this for tomorrow.
