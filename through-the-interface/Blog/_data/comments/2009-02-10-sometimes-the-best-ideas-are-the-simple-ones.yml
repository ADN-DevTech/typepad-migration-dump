    One thing I think needs improvement is the ability to review drawings at the computer
    screen to avoid unecessary printings. The cost of both paper and ink can became
    huge for companies that work with several projects with several reviews.


    The introduction of DWF tools has opened an opportunity to all companies to start
    to use the computer for review tasks but I''m still observing today a lot of people
    which is unsecure to do that at the screen. They keep doing their printings to
    trace color pens over the lines, to add sketches to the drawings, etc.


    This reminds me the age of the ink pens (today replaced by the ploters) when users
    need to draw the sketch using pencil and then pass the ink pen over the lines
    for the final drawing.


    The idea of a font with holes is great but I think this is not enough. My company
    has developed a software to bill plotting into companies to allow CAD managers
    to calculate the total amount of money spent with plotting. The numbers are sometimes
    scary. This tool by itself end up avoiding the waste of money only by monitoring
    users and due that making they think twice before send a plot job to the printer.
    They stop and think..."do I really need to print this?".


    The end result is a huge money saving for plotting pluse the rational use of the
    plotter.


    AutoCAD itself has contributed a lot to the environment once it avoid the use
    of paper and ink but this does not work if people keep printing things to just
    see how beautiful they look at the paper!


    Let''s hear from the other Bloggers... :)


    Regards,

    Fernando.'
