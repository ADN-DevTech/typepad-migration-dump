    For C++,you give the Falsely MDI-Aware Version example.

    What about .NET?'

    If you take a look at the previous entry (Part 1), you can see the "glob" command
    implementation... this could be considered a "Falsely MDI-Aware" command, if the
    command was supposed to be considering the counter variable to be local for each
    document.'

    This is always a subject developers are unaware of when developing ObjectARX applications
    and it would happen with .NET too.


    Thanks, Fernando.'

  body: "hi kean, \n\nare you aware of the difference between static and instance\
    \ variables in an AutoCAD .NET application command class? If you create static\
    \ variables (and a static command method), they exist only once. If you create\
    \ instance variables (and a non-static command method), a new instance of the\
    \ class is instantiated for each AutoCAD document. This automatically generates\
    \ and manages per-document data, with no need for any work at all from your side.\
    \ I have a nice sample demonstrating this, if you like.\n\ncheers\n\njeremy"

    Yes, I am - <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2006/10/perdocument_dat_1.html">the
    previous post</a> covered that.


    The reason I used this approach in <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2008/05/an-automatic--3.html">another
    recent post</a> is actually that sometimes the class instances you receive automatically
    are not the ones you expect - particularly when implementing event handlers (presumably
    it''s because you''re in the application context rather than being in a particular
    document''s context, depending). So I actually find UserData to be more predictable
    and therefore dependable.


    Cheers,

    You''ve said

    "I''ve written some code to demonstrate how you might store and access per-document
    data in the UserData property"

    Where can I find these code? Thank u.

    probably want to use XRecords to do so (search this blog to find examples).

  body: 'Hi Kean,

    I came across this article when i was searching for a way to store custom classes
    in AutoCAD drawing.

    I thought i found the answear until i realised, that this data is not persistent.

    On the other hand XRecord can only store ResultBuffer type in his Data property
    and DBDictionary can only store classes derived from the DBObject class. Or am
    I wrong?


    What is the best way to store custom classes id drawings persistently?

  body: 'Hi Matus,


    Regarding your last question (which may also respond to your others), It depends:


    Xdata for smallish amounts (meaning up to about 4K, as a rule of thumb... there''s
    a shared 16K limit per chunk of Xdata, if I recall correctly).


    Xrecords in extension dictionaries (or centrally in the named objects dictionary)
    for larger amounts.


    ResultBuffers are actually reasonably flexible, if you implement them properly.
