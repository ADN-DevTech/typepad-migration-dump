    if it works then the application should work (unless it''s doing something OS-specific,
    for some reason).


    The devil''s in the detail, as ever.

    will work as long as the APIs they depend upon have not been changed.


    VB6 applications are also mostly appllication idependent, although I don''t remember
    whether you need to use late binding or not to do so (it''s been a while since
    I created a VB6 app, I have to admit).'

    I''m looking for a good sample of Late Binding or for a sample of AutoCAD version
    independent C#-Program.

    Maybe you can help.

    Thanks

    execution speed or the time it takes for me to code without Intellisense :-).


    AutoCAD .NET applications should be forward compatible - as mentioned in this
    article - as long as you don''t depend on APIs exposed in particular releases.

    Late Binding is not that think i prefer.

    To solve that problem I must compile my program for each AutoCAD version with
    the right references. Is that correct?

    Thanks

    To test this out I just built a simple application referencing acmgd.dll and acdbmgd.dll
    from the inc folder of the ObjectARX 2007 SDK. It loaded fine and executed a simple
    command using Editor.WriteMessage() in AutoCAD 2010.


    As long as the API functionality you need is there, .NET should remain forward
    compatible.

    I reference acmgd.dll and acdbmgd.dll from 2007 and it will run under 2008 and
    so on.

    I have a tough task ahead. I will have to port a ObjectARX 2000 application to
    ObjectARX 2010 in order to make it run on the new AutoCAD 2010. Could you please
    folks, give me some hints (or point me some documentation) about the steps that
    must be taken to accomplish this task.


    Thanks in advance.
