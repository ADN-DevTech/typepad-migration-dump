    Does this mean Edit & Continue will work on 64bit inside AutoCAD as long as you
    aren''t trying to access fonts? Or is it just a waste of time to attempt Edit
    & Continue?'

  body: 'Mike,


    The specific problem accessing fonts is likely to be the tip of the iceberg: the
    fact that the wrong thread loaded AcDb is likely to cause all kinds of issues,
    some subtle, some much less so.


    You''d risk spend more time tracking down strange behaviour than you''d end up
    gaining from E&C, I suspect.

    Those are bad news, I wonder if there is any chance to fix the thread issue in
    the AcDb*.dll (i found only a few of them in my 2014 install) with a set of new
    ones and replacing the existent just for development?

    It is indeed bad news (if you were counting on being able to use Edit & Continue,
    of course).


    We''re considering our options, but this new debugging mechanism presents quite
    a big structural change (however simple it might appear).


    If you''re an ADN member you might want to check in with that team - they should
    certainly be tracking the significance of this issue with external developers.

    had great luck with e&c anyway, the errors caught were not usually fixed with
    minor tweaks, I needed to change some class definition or something.

  body: 'Hi Kean,


    did you also try this scenario?:

    1. Start AutoCAD regularly

    2. "netload" the .NET dll

    3. In VS 2013, use "Attach to process" (or however it''s called in english VS
    editions)

    4. Hit a break point and try to edit and continue


    I haven''t tested it myself as I''m still using VS2010 but maybe it works.

    This also improves AutoCAD speed while debugging massively btw.

    It''s indeed called "Attach to Process". :-)


    I haven''t tried it myself - I''m also not in front of my system with VS2013,
    at the moment - but the indications from <a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2013/11/debugging-revit-2014-api-with-visual-studio-2013.html">the
    post about Revit</a> aren''t good (if I''ve understood the situation correctly).


    I''ll give it a try, later on, although I don''t expect it to work (I''ll post
    a follow-up comment if it happens to).

    The first two options you recommended did not work for me. However, this is what
    did:


    Right-click on "acad" project in the solution explorer -> properties -> "Use Legacy
    Managed Engine"


    Note that my initial project setup needed to take advantage of the "Solution 3"
    you recommended in another blog:

    far it looks good to me:

    open acdb19.dll with a hex editor and search for the byte sequence:

    0F 85 CF 80 53 00

    replace it with

    90 90 90 90 90 90

    please make a backup of acdb19.dll before, only change the bytes if the exact
    byte sequence is found and that uniquely

    any more by acdb19.dll'
