  body: 'Hi RS,


    To use point cloud data, you currently need to use C++. To import point cloud
    data, you can use an approach such as the one I used in BrowsePhotosynth and the
    Kinect integration for AutoCAD (just search my blog to find out more).


    And you should really post this type of question via ADN or the AutoCAD .NET Discussion
    Group - you''ll get a more reliable answer there.


    Regards,


    Kean'
