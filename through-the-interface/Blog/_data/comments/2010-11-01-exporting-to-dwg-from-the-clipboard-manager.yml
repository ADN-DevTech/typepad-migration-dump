  body: 'That’s it for today’s update. There’s one last issue that’s been reported
    that I’m working through: sometimes you need to click twice in the drawing after
    selecting “paste” from a newly-selected item for it to place the geometry. There’s
    clearly some kind of focus-related issue, but it’s proving a little tricky to
    chase down (such issues often prove tough to debug). Hopefully I’ll find a way
    to address it, otherwise I’ll just recommend people to right-click directly, which
    appears to avoid the problem.


    The double-always occurs when two or all tool palettes are locked.'

    I''ve added a call to set the focus back to AutoCAD just after we call a command,
    which seems to resolve the problem. I''ll be posting it later today.
