    I have no idea - I imagine, you can, but doubt there are any UI integration points,
    from what little I know of Inventor''s API.


    I suggest asking ADN (as I believe you''re a member).

    On a related note, Albert showed an alternative technique for using AddVisual()
    during his AU session on .NET 4.0: he implemented an OnSize() (or equivalent)
    event handler that resized the user control whenever the WPF palette was resized.
    In case you''d rather not go through all the thunking with the ElementHost.

  body: 'Hi Kean,


    I have developed a plug-in for autoCAD using WPF. What happens is that there is
    a button on QuickAccessToolBar and on click of it, opens a new WINDOW. When i
    make this window as ModelWindow by making windows property ShowInTaskBar =true,
    sometimes it disappears automaticly and Hangs the AutoCAD. After that i have close
    AutoCAD from task manage left with no other option.



    When i make this as property as ShowInTaskBar =false then it works absolutly fine.


    what wrong exactly i am doing Or what should i do to fix this.


    Kind Regards,


    Vikas'

    This isn''t a forum for support.


    Your comment doesn''t appear to relate to this post, so please submit your future
    questions to <a href="http://adn.autodesk.com">the ADN team</a>, if you''re a
    member, or otherwise <a href="http://discussion.autodesk.com/forums/forum.jspa?forumID=152">the
    AutoCAD .NET Discussion Group</a>.


    That said, it sounds as though you''re invoking the dialog directly from the code
    behind the QuickAccessToolbar button. I suggest firing off a command that displays
    your dialog, instead.

  body: 'Hi Andrey,


    I''m not clear on what exactly you mean: are you trying to reuse the ElementHost
    on multiple tabs, or is there a problem with the above code?


    Either way, this isn''t something I''m likely to revisit, at this stage: if this
    particular approach doesn''t work for you then I suggest going with AddVisual()
    but implementing an OnSize() event-handler to fill the control as the containing
    palette gets resized, as mentioned here:

    I know it''s been a while since this topic was in focus. I can''t solve this:
    I want my palette to appear on the bottom side (on top of the console). It''s
    attached to the left side on startup. Is there a way to set a start position?'

    Have you tried checking the Registry to see what info is stored when the palette
    is docked at the bottom vs. the left?


    Failing that I''d suggest posting to the discussion group: someone there must
    have come across this requirement.
