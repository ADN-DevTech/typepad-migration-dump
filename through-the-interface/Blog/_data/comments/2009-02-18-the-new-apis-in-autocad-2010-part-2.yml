    The following article mentioned VSTA in AutoCAD:      http://blog.jtbworld.com/2009/02/autocad-2010-vba-and-vsta-future.html


    Can you say something about VSTA in AutoCAD?'

    VSTA won''t be there when AutoCAD 2010 ships, which is about all I can say, for
    now.


    David -


    It''s also much too soon to predict (and talk about) when a .NET API might be
    there for parametrics. Once again all I can say is that it won''t be there at
    the release of AutoCAD  2010.

    I''m trying to change a PDF underlay absolute path into a relative path and after
    the routine terminates, AutoCAD crashes as soon as the user do anything.

    The same routine works fine with DWF underlays.

    Any idea ?'

    I''m afraid I don''t know the answer (and this really isn''t a forum for support).


    I suggest posting your question to the appropriate <a href="http://discussion.autodesk.com">online
    discussion group</a> (if you''re not an <a href="http://adn.autodesk.com">ADN</a>
    member).

    I''m sorry if it wasn''t the right place to post.

    I''ll try to the ADN support.


    Just for information, I encounter the same issue using LISP or .NET.
