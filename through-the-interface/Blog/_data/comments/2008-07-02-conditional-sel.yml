  body: 'Thanks Kean,


    This question has a very thin relatationship with the post, but still posting
    it in a hope that possibly this could even turn out to be a post one day!


    Okay, the question is that what should I do if I want to expose properties of
    my custom entity to AutoCAD''s filter mechanism.  For example, if I have a custom
    entity called myCircle, derived from AcDbEntity has a property mRadius.  I want
    the users to use AutoCAD standard mechanism to filter all myCircle entities with
    values of mRadius is greater than 20.


    Thanks,

    Narayanan'

  body: 'Hi Narayanan,


    Actually this is reasonably closely related, but unfortunately I don''t know of
    a way to customize the FILTER dialog: there would need to be a way to connect
    descriptions of properties with their underlying DXF group-code (and the datatype
    they contain).


    That said, the FILTER command only really uses the internal mechanism described
    in this post, so you could implement your own tailored feature that works with
    your objects.


    I hope this helps,

    You could try replacing DxfCode.Operator with -4 (its value), in case that helps.

    I have a list of Civil3D surfaces in which I can select through basic auto cad
    quick properties via "Tin Surface" object type and "Name" property. Is there someway
    I can use the dfxcode operators to do this automatically? I have been searching
    for a list of what all of these operators do/mean, maybe that would be a good
    post too!!

    Assuming Civil 3D objects support the DXF protocol, you should be able to select
    them using these operators. But I don''t know whether that''s the case, as I don''t
    use Civil 3D - you may want to check in with the ADN team or perhaps Isaac via
    his blog.

    1) How do I filter entities with certain XData-IDs. There is a "DxfCode.XDataStart"
    code but

    new TypedValue((int)DxfCode.XDataStart, "MY_XDATA") doesn''t work. The AutoCAD''s
    "FILTER" command (that provides the serialization of custom filters to a filter.nfl
    file in the appdata directory) created the entry "( -3(''MY_XDATA''))" for the
    filter. The syntax slightly differs to other filters that work with TypedValues,
    e.g. "(8 . ''MY_LAYER'')".

    2) Do these filters also apply to a given (preselected) ObjectIDCollection and
    if yes, how?
