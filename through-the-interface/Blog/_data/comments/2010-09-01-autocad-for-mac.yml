    For now that means a subset of ObjectARX and AutoLISP will be available to developers

    [/quote]

    Kean,

    Can you be more explicit about the limitations ?

    Does this mean that all VisualLisp is unusable ?

    What are the limitations for ObjectARX ?


    Regards,

    I don''t have a complete list of the differences and as I haven''t been working
    with this myself, as yet, anything I say is likely to be less than perfectly accurate.


    My understanding is that the ObjectARX headers are pretty complete, as far as
    it goes, and even for Visual LISP you''ll hopefully be pleasantly surprised with
    what has been exposed (there are some vl- functions that are available, for instance,
    although I don''t expect there to be anything to do with COM).


    I''ll ask someone from my team who has some actual experience with/knowledge of
    the differences to comment.


    Regards,

  body: 'Hi Kerry,


    As you''d expect, the main omissions are AutoCAD APIs that use Windows-specific
    functionality. For example, there are no MFC UI classes in ObjectARX and no COM
    APIs in ObjectARX or LISP. And there is no Visual LISP IDE in this first release,
    but a LISP application compiled on Windows will work on the Mac if its not using
    any of the unavailable APIs.


    In many cases, if you''re not using those Windows APIs, you can just recompile
    your ARX code and it works.


    There''s really too much information to write it all in a comment here, so please
    be patient and Fenton and I will be discussing the APIs in our next devcast (coming
    soon :-)).


    Cheers,


    Stephen'

  body: 'As an electrical engineer in the industrial water/wastewater sector, I''m
    very excited to consider the possibilities of Autodesk applications on mobile
    devices. However, I am wary of anything that is implemented as SaaS for mobile
    use. When I go out in the field, one thing I can count on is that I will probably
    not get good cellular reception on site (and obviously be unlikely to have WiFi
    available). As such, native mobile apps are really going to be necessary for use
    in my industry (and other similar ones where the job site may not be within a
    crowded city center with excellent cellular reception).


    The one thing I would be most interested in would be a version of Design Review
    for the iPad. I would love to be able to load up an iPad with documents and DWF
    drawings to carry into the field rather than carrying 15lbs of paper documents.
    In addition, it would give me the ability to make quick markups on the DWFs and
    send them back to the office while I am still in the field.
