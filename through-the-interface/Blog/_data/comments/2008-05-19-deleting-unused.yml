    Yes, you''d need to build it into a .NET Class Library and NETLOAD it into AutoCAD.
    You could also use demand-loading to load it on start-up.


    You could run the command on startup, but obviously you''d need to watch out for
    unused scales that are actually important to keep around.

  body: 'It''s not really clear whether you need help creating a button for your command
    (I suggest searching on "CUIX") or how to implement the functionality. It should
    be easy to maintain your own list of scales somewhere in the DWG (or perhaps tag
    them with XData - that could/should work) and then provide the capability to delete
    them.


    If this doesn''t help, please post a more detailed question to the ADN team or
    the AutoCAD .NET Discussion Group.
