  body: I have fond memories of programming the Sinclair when I was young.  If you
    wanted to play a game on it, you had to write the code :-)

  body: 'I remember that was certainly the case with the ZX80 and ZX81...


    I had a friend who typed a full listing into his ZX81 from a magazine without
    realising he had to press "Enter" at the end of each line. I can still remember
    him sharing the frustration he felt when he tried to run it.


    I also remember my first experience of trouble-shooting code: there was a typo
    in a program listing in PC World. I was so happy and proud when I managed to get
    it running (it may well have been that feeling that sent me down this career-path,
    thinking about it).

  body: I had an apple II+ that my dad made a video card for. I forget why, but he
    made it using wire-wrapping to connect all the parts. It was a total miniature
    rats nest of wires, and overheated when I played games. I recall typing the pong
    program in BASIC from the manual, and hit enter to run. It was about 200 lines
    of code and ran. It was not saved so only ran once. I was in 3rd grade at the
    time and it was worth it.

  body: 'I have 2 Sinclair QLs at home. One of them works, or at least it did the
    last time I fired it up some years ago. The other is my original purchase that
    was pre-ordered using my hard-earned teenager''s pittance wages and eventually
    delivered after a long delay. That one locked up and died a few years later, and
    is now a spare parts resource.


    One of the fun things Sinclair did was to change SuperBASIC between different
    ROM versions, such that the order of parameters was reversed for one or two procedures.
    That made life interesting for all those kids typing in code from magazines. My
    apparently identical machines need different code, or at least code that interrogates
    the ROM version and handles the differences. Thanks, Sir Clive.'

  body: 'Very nostalgic...Sigh...


    In the second half of the 80''s I had a Philips MSX for first and then an MSX2.
    Already at that time I had written a program to do drawings...good times...


    Bye
