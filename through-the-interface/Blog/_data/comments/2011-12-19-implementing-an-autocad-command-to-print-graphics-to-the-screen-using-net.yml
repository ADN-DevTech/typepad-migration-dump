  body: 'not sure what the first comment was referring to, but the above technique
    is very useful for warning the user of bad things when they open a drawing.

    I do this in lisp with the grdraw function. When there are more than 4000 regapps,
    it tells them with a big white background, and drawn text.  I digitized romansx
    font to automate the text drawing operation.  Now I can throw up any message i
    want, without messing up scripts or anything else.  Its like the screen becomes
    a heads up display.  Those regapps are still a big problem because the spreading
    mechanism is so aggressive.'
