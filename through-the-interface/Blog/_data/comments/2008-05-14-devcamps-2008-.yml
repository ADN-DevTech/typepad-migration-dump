    Thanks very much for your response, I thought that might have been the case, sadly
    the things that I''d like to see are more the keynotes (including your own) which
    may not quite have the same impact as just a PPT etc.


    I''d echo your sentiments though that the DevCamps, DevDays and TechCamps, not
    to mention AU I''ve been to before have been some of the most useful events I''ve
    ever attended, and not just for the classroom sessions, the up-close contact you
    describe is usually worth attending on its own!


    It''s just a shame it''s not so easy for me to find the budget for another trip
    the US, I''ll just have to catch up with you when you make it back to the next
    UK event, or see if I can make it to AU08 :)


    Hope everything goes well for this "tour" and I''ll see you (both) soon.
