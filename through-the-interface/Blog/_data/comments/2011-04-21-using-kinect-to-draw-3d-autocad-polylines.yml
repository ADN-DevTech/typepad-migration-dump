  body: 'Kean,

    Does your experience so far show that the kinect has enough "feedback resolution"
    to use in real AutoCad? I love what you are doing, just wondering if no matter
    how far down the road you get, it will be like having a jumpy cursor.  Does it
    afford enough control at this point where you could do things like trace some
    polyline drawn on paper and hung on the wall?  I''m sure things will get better
    and better, just wondering on your feelings about that at this point.'

  body: 'James,


    It depends what you''re looking for.


    Technically, the Kinect''s sensor is currently working at 640x480, but that''s
    apparently due to a deliberate decision to optimise the processing throughput
    by the Xbox 360. There''s no reason the resolution couldn''t be greater.


    In terms of whether AutoCAD can handle the sampling rate... I''m stripping the
    points down to about 10% during the jig, and it''s impressively responsive (on
    a 3-year old notebook, no less). It feels good!


    There are some caveats I probably ought to mention: right now the jig is looking
    for mouse input, rather than treating Kinect as a 1st class input device... so
    I have my mouse in my hand, moving the cursor by stroking the laser sensor, to
    make sure the jig keeps reading the sensor data. A bit of a pain, but it works.


    The fact you can actually position and select in 3D using the Kinect has incredible
    potential - providing users get the navigation controls and visual feedback to
    know they''re where they want to be.


    I believe this is game-changing technology for our industry. But then I''ve been
    wrong before. :-)


    Cheers,


    Kean'

  body: Amazing stuff Kean. Is there anyway you could post a video of your amazing
    work? Could you move the Kinect to 3 or 4 known locations to maps an object or
    a room?

  body: 'I''ve been thinking about recording something - I''ll see what I can put
    together.


    I know projects that have used a moving - or multiple - Kinect(s) to map larger
    areas... I don''t think it''s very easy to calibrate the data from multiple sources,
    but software is doing that all the time for laser scans (it''s probably beyond
    the scope of this blog, though).

  body: you are right about this kind of input being a game changer. In fact, any
    time you make the input happen in the same place as the item being drawn, you
    massivly increase the ease of use. I do this with civil engineering design, and
    almost never look at my "table" of stations and elevations for profiles. AutoDesk
    is catching up on certain parts of design, but I don't think they realize the
    value of it yet. You can push that by adding in the 3d part to make it look cool.
