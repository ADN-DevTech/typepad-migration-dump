  body: 'hi Kean,

    I am rewriting my VBA command to .NET, that command saved all opened drawings
    in lower autocad version and closed them, worked fine

    I am having a problem in .NET, where I get an exception "Drawing is busy." when
    trying to close the last drawing (the one that the command was initiated from)


    You don''t seem to be having this problem in your code.'

    now it works, BUT


    I get an error message in AutoCAD Map Messages window (which is strange, as I''m
    not using AutoCAD Map), the errors are Cannot save options in the drawing and
    eLockViolation (2 consecutive occurrences)

    Also the resulted drawings can only be open using recover command, if I save them
    in 2000 version, if I save them in 2010, they are opened OK'

  body: 'Hi Matus,


    OK, good - you''ve realised you had missed making it a "session" command. One
    implication of defining a session command is that it no lomger implicitly locks
    the currently active document: you need to use Document.LockDocument() to do so,
    disposing of the returned lock when you''ve finished.


    I suggest posting your complete code to <a href="http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/NET/bd-p/152">the
    AutoCAD .NET Discussion Group</a>, if this advice doesn''t help.

    this solved both problems, the error and the need of recover.'

    I am just starting with events. (Starting to get the hang of things sort of)


    One question is I would like to check to see if the user has pressed YES or NO
    or CANCEL on the Close Drawing button.


    i.e. If they press YES to save I would love to do a bunch of secondary commands
    to the drawing (mostly read only stuff) before it closes.


    Any Suggestions?

    Unfortunately I don''t have time to respond to support requests (that aren''t
    specifically related to my posts).


    Please do submit your question to <a href="http://adn.autodesk.com">the ADN team</a>,
    if you''re a member, or otherwise <a href="http://discussion.autodesk.com/forums/forum.jspa?forumID=152">the
    AutoCAD .NET Discussion Group</a>.


    [Off the top of my head, you should look at the Document.BeginSave() event, or
    something like that.]

    It could well be something has been fixed between 2010 and 2012 (I tend to worry
    more when newer versions top working, naturally).


    Beyond that I can''t really say what''s happening. I suggest posting your code
    to ADN or to the AutoCAD .NET Discussion Group, in case someone there can comment.
