  body: 'Hi Kean, I clicked the shapeshifter link, and got to the site but could not
    draw anything. I eventually realized I was missing the bottom toolbar with the
    shapes, so I tried chrome instead of IE. It then worked.

    Also, the online circuits site that Adesk bought only works in chrome. It works
    horribly slow though, same as last time I checked. The chrome issue should be
    mentioned more often I think.

    Anyway, I see that shapeshifter outputs obj or stl. I think the far more important
    thing to work on is a command for acad to output an stl from any solid. Then you
    will get people like me making ten times more utilities to make patterned shapes
    like shapeshifter does. Its a cool tool though as is no doubt, and not trivial
    just because its not in acad. I''ll try them in a few weeks when my printer is
    ready.'

  body: 'Hi James,


    Doesn''t it give a warning about needing WebGL when in IE? That''s strange, if
    not.


    Yes - a lot of these sites require technologies that haven''t (yet) made it into
    IE, although hopefully they will in time.


    As per my other comment: STLOUT is intended to do this - interested in hearing
    how/why it doesn''t fit the bill.
