    (I have just submitted an ADN request for this, but if you know the answer off
    the top of your head, I''d appreciate it, as it will save me some time.)


    For a global configuration option in our software, the user needs to be able to
    select a linetype for use in other new drawings. The linetype could have been
    loaded from a file. Is there a way to know what file the selected linetype has
    been loaded from? Is the linetype''s name and filename sufficient information
    to programmatically load the selected linetype into a new drawing?


    Kind regards

    Michael'

    Nothing off the top of my head (nor with a little research), I''m afraid.


    I''m sure someone on my team will have a better answer for you, soon.


    Best regards,

    doc:


    > If filename is not a URL and does not contain a path, then the AutoCAD library
    search path is searched for the file.


    So you can simply do:


    db.LoadLineTypeFile("*", "acad.lin");
