    \ ObjectAdded and Activate.\nI have noticed in the examples similar functions\
    \ can be accessed using .Net applications, but first the CommandMethod method\
    \ must be run. Is it possible to have the functions waiting for autoCAD methods\
    \ without calling CommandMethod?\n\nRegards \n\nChris"

    Absolutely. Check out <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2006/09/initialization_.html">this
    post</a>, which shows how to implement code that is executed when your module
    is loaded.
