  body: "One or two releases ago, acedUserBrk() was changed to not call AfxPumpMessage()\
    \ on the main thread, because it caused many problems. \n\nSo the developers renamed\
    \ acedUsrBrk() to acedUsrBrkWithMessagePump(), and implemented a new acedUsrBrk()\
    \ that does not call AfxPumpMessge() to process pending input messages.\n\nI've\
    \ found that for checking the input queue, and also getting AutoCAD to periodically\
    \ update its window, the simplest and easiest way to do this from managed code,\
    \ is to just P/Invoke acedUsrBrkWithMessagePump(), and be done with it.\n\n:)"

  body: I truly appreciate the example above.  However I'm trying to apply a similar
    use for the Tab key.  Can you give me any suggestions on how to check whether
    the Tab key has been pressed?

  body: 'I suppose you could fire off another process to view a web-page. I''d warn
    against locking up the AutoCAD-based code while waiting for something elsewhere
    to happen (that''s likely to end badly), but a separate process should be safe
    enough.
