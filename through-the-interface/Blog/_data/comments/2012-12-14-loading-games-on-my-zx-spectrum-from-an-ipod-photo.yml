  body: amazing you figure this stuff out. I am sure someday someone will feel equaly
    impressed at loading an mp3 onto the ipod and getting that to play. Someone should
    make a contest to see who can get devices working for the widest spectrum of time.
    I think card programmed computers are next!

  body: 'What an absolutely brilliant idea! I''m sat here massively impressed Kean!


    I''m quite literally on eBay now buying one and was wondering how to get the modern
    files loaded onto it.


    Very innovative solution. :-)'

  body: 'Hi Patrick,


    Thanks for stopping by!


    I found it difficult to make use of the batch conversion capability - whether
    from user error or the feature not working remains to be seen. I''d very much
    like to see this area enhanced, even if it''s to make it simpler for people like
    me to use. :-)


    Merci et bonne anneé,


    Kean
