  body: For what it is worth, I had to do a complete uninstall of the Microsoft Office
    2007 32 bit Suite, and a reboot, before I could install the MS Office 64bit 2010
    Beta.  If I had installed the 2010-32bit MS Office, it would have done an inplace
    upgrade.  I've had several issues, with addins, and some application built on
    MS Office Excel, not working with 2010, since there is a different name on many
    of the 64 bit dll files versus their 32bit counterparts.

    regretted it when we had an influx of queries about problems fans had with it!

    the 64 bit driver and then re-installing office 32bit? Would it work??

    OK.....well I was able to get through all the Microsoft redlights.  I downloaded
    both the 32&64 bit versions of the 2010- Microsoft Office14 Database Engines for
    MS Access.  First I used WinRAR to open the exe file, and extract to a temp folder.  After
    that I used a freeware utility, Universal Extractor, to tear open the msi packages.  Once
    that was done, the second tier installer autoran, and installed the necearry components,
    without getting stopped by the Office Version Testers.'

    Not sure why they would block the installation if you have MS Office installed.
    It must interfere with some aspect of it, but so far it is working fine. You can
    now add an ODBC access data source.'

    It worked for me with the release version of the Microsoft Access Database Engine
    2010.

    Now I have both MSOffice 2003 and the 64 bits ODBC drivers installed and working.
    For now...
