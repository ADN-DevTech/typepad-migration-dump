    steps to help you build a loadable module out of the code in my blog</a>, but
    there''s one big reason I can''t post compiled product modules: working for a
    publicly-traded US company, there are strict accounting rules around the provision
    of "free" product updates and consequent revenue recognition.


    I do provide applications via Autodesk Labs, which has legal language in place
    that allows our users to get hold of such functionality without the risk of impacting
    the company from a financial perspective, but I don''t have that on my blog.


    If you''re unable to build the code into an application yourself, someone on <a
    href="http://discussion.autodesk.com/forums/forum.jspa?forumID=152">our AutoCAD
    .NET Discussion Forum</a> may be able to do it for you.


    Sorry - I sincerely wish I was in a position to help.

    Have you tested this with annotative blocks?  There was a limitation in 2011 and
    lower that prevents you from inserting an annotative block into a table cell.  I
    don''t have 2012 to determine if this has changed.'

    I admit I have not - but as we''re inserting blocks created from the modelspaces
    of external DWGs, I doubt this would be a problem for this particular scenario.

    great code! But there is a bug...


    When i have two different block definitions with the same name (sometime could
    happen) , the block of the second drawing will be redefined with the first one.


    I need to rename all the block definitions in every drawing with the filename
    as prefix (like an external reference).


    Anyway, thank you for every line of your code.


    P.S.

    i think is very interesting all the post about kinect.

    You''re quite right - there are some cases where I haven''t handled various issues
    related to block naming, etc. I should have mentioned that these were left as
    an exercise for the reader. :-)


    Thanks for the feedback!

    I am working with 3D Plant design and I am trying to find a way of creating drawing
    legend from my P&ID drawing.

    by passing through forums I found your code.


    does it work for my case too? if yes. How do I introduce it to my P&ID? Do I need
    a software or just through Plant design?


    Thank you

  body: 'Hello Nawfel,


    It''d work with Plant 3D/P&ID drawings at the file level - just as it would for
    AutoCAD files - but would clearly need work to do anything more granular (i.e.
    with the file contents).


    To load it into your AutoCAD-based product you''ll need to build it into a DLL
    using Visual Studio (or Visual C# Express) and NETLOAD it into the product.
