  body: You used the islayout qualifier to cal the proper block you are looking for
    in theis sequence. Is there a way to change the props of a block that is not a
    layout but rather just an ordinary modelspace designed block. I am having trouble
    as I seem to need to end the transaction of insert before I can access the dynamic
    props. But now how do I reselect the block without actually clicking it again
    to make it active? Any help would be appreciated
