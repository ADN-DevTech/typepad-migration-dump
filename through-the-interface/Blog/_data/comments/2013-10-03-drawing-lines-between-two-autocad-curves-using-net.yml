  body: this kind of thing is what civil's do when making 3d plines of say, road centerlines.
    We generate points every 5', then also add points at key horizontal and vertical
    locations (stations), then find the elevation for them using the profile and you
    have the 3d pline. I even tighten up the spacing on horizontal arcs where distance
    between points is less than 1/12th the delata turned. So no corners get cut. We
    don't connect the dots to other curve dots though, the tin triangulation does
    the connecting needed for surfaces.

  body: In most cases where I've done this, I don't ask the user anything (I determine
    the corresponding start/end points by their relative distances), but if you are
    going to ask them something, why not simply ask them to pick the two curves nearer
    the corresponding start points?

  body: 'Great suggestion. The main reason is that it didn''t occur to me at the time
    I was writing it (and that I wanted something to help me for the subsequent post,
    rather than needing something with a perfect user experience).


    I''ll certainly do this for v2 (if there is one), though!
