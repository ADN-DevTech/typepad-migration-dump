  body: Gimp works great for icons too. Just load your different icon size images
    as layers and save as a .ico file B)

  body: Hi. I was on a search for resolving the issue of favicons not displaying in
    IE9 when I ran across this page. I hoped this explanation would provide it. Unfortunately,
    your favicon isn't showing up in my IE9 browser either. I just get the default
    Explorer "e". Off to hunt some more...

  body: 'I found IE9 was tricky to get working - even now it''s quite inconsistent
    about picking up the favicon for the 16x16 image. I *think* the first few lines
    of metadata helped, but I can''t be sure.


    It''s not clear whether this is due to sensitivity to the favicon you provide,
    some optimised browser caching or just a bug (the most likely reason, IMO).
