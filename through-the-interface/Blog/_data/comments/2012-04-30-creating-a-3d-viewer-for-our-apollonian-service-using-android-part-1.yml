    I use C# for both Android and iOS

    I suppose I should have clarified that there are frameworks that allow you to
    target different platforms from languages such as C# (just as we saw last time
    with Unity3D), although I admit I don''t have any personal experience of them
    (other than with Unity, and that was targeting web/desktop rather than mobile).


    I''ve also heard good things about Appcelerator, but then that''s JavaScript based,
    so doesn''t necessarily help us C#-heads.


    One thing I should add for other readers... it''s clearly a tricky job choosing
    a particular cross-platform framework (especially in the long-run). And I''m certainly
    not in a position to advocate any particular system: my choice in this series
    was to focus on free tools - and to get some exposure to the native development
    experience, as that''s fun to do, too. :-)

    Seems like (in the long run) it should cut down on the work that needs to be done
    on both Apple and Google environs. (BTW, I''m just getting caught up to these
    Android and iOS posts. So if you have commented on this already, please forgive
    me.)


    All the best,

  body: 'Yes - I''d definitely expect some kind of cross-platform technology to be
    the way to go, in the near- to medium-term. There are a slew of them out there,
    and it seems like I find out about a new one each day: Xamarin, Appcelerator,
    PhoneGap, MoSync, Unity3D... I imagine they all have relative strengths/weaknesses.
    The trick is betting on one that has legs and can meet your needs in the long
    run.


    Longer-term I still have high hopes that HTML5 will provide adequate enough performance
    to mean we can skip "compile to native" toolkits/middleware.


    But then the whole native app emergence took me by surprise, so who knows how
    long that will continue (and, if you listen to some, the benefits in terms of
    performance/power consumption is driving developers closer to the metal on mobile
    devices, increasing usage of unmanaged code (C++) for many apps... go figure).
