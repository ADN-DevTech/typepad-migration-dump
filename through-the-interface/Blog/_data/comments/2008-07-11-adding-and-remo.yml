    Thank you for that great posting, but I''ve one more question to this topic:

    Is it possible to set a layerfilter activ  using .NET API?


    thanks in advance,

    I don''t believe so. The ADN team, or someone on the discussion groups, may know
    differently, though.

    You entries have been great with helping me get started with Acad Programming.
    Your example above shows how to create a property type filter, how do you add
    layers to a group type filter (LayerGroup class)? I can create the group filter
    but can''t figure out how to add layers to the group.  The filterexpression method
    is available but doesn''t seem to work (at least not like with the LayerFilter
    object)


    i.e.

    Dim lyrGrp As New LayerGroup

    Dim lyrFltr As New LayerFilter

    lyrFltr.FilterExpression = "NAME==""LayerName""" ''works

    lyrGrp.FilterExpression = "NAME==""LayerName""" ''does not work


    Thanks,

    Mike'

    Check the blog tomorrow for a post detailing how to do this.

  body: 'Hi Kean,


    I''ve trying to set a layerFilter active.

    Using the name property of the Root/Current only renames the current one. And
    because the Root and Current are readonly you can''t set a object to it (LayerFilter),
    But the new method accepts a Root and current LayerFilter objects, I''ve tried
    it and it does the trick.

    Well, spoke to soon.

    The LayerFilter needs to be accessed once thruw the layermanager. (per drawing).
    After this the "new method" works. ??

    to index into the LayerFilterCollection via a string or - if that''s not possible
    - iterate through the LayerFilters and check for one with the Name you''re after
    before deleting it.

    That worked great.

  body: 'Eugene,


    You need to remove the curly brackets around the lft assignment (which makes that
    variable exist only in a very short local scope), and then you can set lfc relative
    to lft and, at the end, set db.LayerFilters to be lft (just as I did in the above
    sample).


    You should probably only delete the layer filters your application has created
    (by retrieving them by name rather than index) otherwise you''re likely to trash
    any that have been added by the user or another application.
