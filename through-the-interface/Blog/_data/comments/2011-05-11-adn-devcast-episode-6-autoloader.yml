  body: And here I thought I was going to get to add a plug-in to Autoloader.  That
    is Autoloader for Vault.

  body: Interesting to note that the module load order in the file appears to be read
    from the bottom up. Is this something typical for xml files, or just how autoloader
    is programmed?

    Is there any xsd schema available for creating the packagecontent.xml file?'

  body: Not an XML feature, but it is how autoloader is designed. The idea is to order
    the files so you load the DLLs on which other DLLs are dependent first (i.e. put
    them at the bottom of the list). Although, when I have dependencies, I tend to
    prefer to implement a loader DLL and just tell autoloader to load that.

  body: There is no formal schema, but the PackageContents.xml format is documented
    in the AutoCAD 2012 helpfiles (as explained in the video).

    is installed.

  body: Is it possible to place *.bundle inside zip with same name? Like docx and
    xlsx. Or it's more inspired with Apple Application bundle format.

  body: "Hi Kean! Great blog! It has been very helpful!\n\nI have a question that\
    \ is related to the Autoloader, but not directly related to .NET. I saw in the\
    \ video that you are loading CUIx files with the Autoloader. I have tried this\
    \ and it is an awesome feature! I only have one problem... it appears that when\
    \ a .bundle is loaded from the \\ApplicationPlugins folder that any cuix files\
    \ in that bundle are copied to the \\AutoCAD 2012 - English\\R18.2\\enu\\Support\
    \ folder.  \n\nMy problem is that when I edit my cuix file and replace the old\
    \ version in the .bundle, it does not copy the new cuix files to the same \\AutoCAD\
    \ 2012 - English\\R18.2\\enu\\Support folder when AutoCAD starts again. So it\
    \ is still loading the old cuix files from the \\Support folder. Is there a way\
    \ around this?\n\nThanks for your advice!"
