    depend on how you want to handle it (whether you want multiple table columns,

    Not sure what you mean by LISP (this is C# code) and I haven''t come across that
    error.

    I suggest starting with the resources posted on <a href="http://www.autodesk.com/developautocad">the
    AutoCAD Developer Center</a>, where you''ll find the AutoCAD .NET Labs.

  body: 'Hey Kean,


    I am building a small application and came to the point where i have to populate
    a table with information I got stored in a List. Basically I want to embed my
    X, Y, Z coordinates of points, stored in that list, in the table.


    I started to go through the Autocad library myself first exploring all the Table
    Methods and properties to get the job done.


    Problem I have is putting text in the rows. I can create the table/write that
    entity to db and adjust its features (with,height).


    After wondering what i was doing wrong i read your post and simplified my code
    so I could present my problem as good as possible.


    This is my code : problem at the point i insert text into my newly created row.


    const double colWidth = 15.0;

    const double rowHeight = 3.0;


    Document doc = Autodesk.AutoCAD.ApplicationServices.Application.DocumentManager.MdiActiveDocument;

    Database db = doc.Database;


    Table tb = new Table();


    tb.NumRows = 1;


    tb.NumColumns = 1;


    tb.SetRowHeight(rowHeight);


    tb.SetColumnWidth(colWidth);

    tb.TableStyle = db.Tablestyle;


    Point3d p3d = new Point3d(0, 0,0);


    tb.Position = p3d;

    MessageBox.Show("start add text columns");

    //Here is where I get a exception and where I am clueless why it doesnt work

    SetCellText(tb, 0, 1, "test");


    PS. I ofcourse used the method SetCellText you provided me in my class. Even if
    I try to alter the table''s SetTextString I get a error.


    I know you are a bussy man and this is an old post, but any help would be much
    appreciated.'

    I found the solution. The problem was my own stupidity. The first column is 0
    not 1.


    I will take advantage of this posting to thank you for your lovely input you are
    giving us through this blog. I am a huge fan of your blog and am sure I will use
    more of your input in the future as I am making a application for my final at
    school.'

    Could you please clarify me whether "Is it possible to place dimension by referencing
    Block Attributes Co-Ordinates" For ex: If we have two block attributes and wants

    You should be able to get the location information from the specific attribute
    references. It may be harder to make the dimension associative.


    I suggest posting follow-up questions via the AutoCAD .NET Discussion Group or
    the ADN team.
