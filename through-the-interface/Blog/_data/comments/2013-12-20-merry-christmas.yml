    Yes - and will be very interesting to see what Kinect Fusion can do with the extra
    data...

    I am trying to get this installed on my work computer, but I don''t know where
    to get the addin. I have downloaded the kinectSDK and the kinectdeveloper toolkit.
    what all am I missing to get this thing working in Autocad? Thanks'

  body: Thank you for your reply. I opened up the link you gave me, but you must forgive
    me, I am not a developer. What do I do with all these C# codes? How exactly do
    I get a plug in out of these codes and into Autocad? I really appreciate it!

  body: 'You would need to build the project using Visual C# Express (for instance)
    and then NETLOAD the resulting DLL into AutoCAD. I can''t step you through this
    process, though: I suggest asking for help on the AutoCAD .NET Discussion Groups
    if you hit specific errors.
