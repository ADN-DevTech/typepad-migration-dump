  body: 'Hi Kean,


    AutoCAD 360 web app is interesting with new HTML5 canvas and JavaScript platform.
    I also tried to write a web app like this but still does not have enough time
    to spend with it at <a href="http://www.netscriptcad.com/code-store">http://www.netscriptcad.com/code-store</a>
    . The new technology is already awesome.


    Regards,

    Khoa'

  body: 'I don''t know (and if I did, couldn''t tell) specific plans, but given the
    fact <a href="http://www.autocadws.com/blog/plant-3d-drawings-now-supported-on-autocad-ws/">Plant
    3D is supported</a>, I would hope it''s in the plan.

  body: I have a Nexus 7 and was looking for an app to view Auto Cad drawings when
    I found 360. There seems to be precious little info on how to actually use it
    though. I don't mean a listing of it's features or commands. And to me as important
    as how to use it, but WHY I should use it. Perhaps I am old school but a manual
    would be a good start. Please tell me if there is a resource like this.

    The AutoCAD 360 is generally very responsive to feedback.
