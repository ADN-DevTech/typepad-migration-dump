  body: 'Experimenting with rotation I found that 0, 90 and 270 work but any other
    angle does not. This message is displayed at the command line:

    Could not transform entity: eCannotScaleNonUniformly


    The selected entity was a line.


    Thanks very much for your efforts on this. I was hoping that the light would go
    on for me by now but I am still having trouble understanding.

    For me it isn''t the math as much as how a matrix relates to an entity.'

  body: Thanks for the very clever application, I have a question also. I used AutoCAD
    2010 to test the application and noticed that after I click the Transform button,
    the selected entity will not update until after I manualy click the AutoCAD so
    it will recieve the focus?

  body: 'If you apply the rotation to an individual property (such as the StartPoint
    or EndPoint) then it should work: the issue appears to be with the transformation
    as applied to the whole entity (and is presumably an entity-specific thing).


    Does that confirm what you''re seeing?

    You might try appending "_.REGEN " to the cmd string sent to AutoCAD''s command-line
    in the TransformButton_Click() event.

    The error is different when I try Start or End point.

    I get an unhandled exception when I select either StartPoint or EndPoint and then
    click Transform.

    Error is at line 187. TargetInvocationException.


    1. Start "Matrix"

    2. Select Object (pick an existing rectangle)

    3. Change "Entire Entity" to "StartPoint"

    4. Change Angle to 9. (or whatever)

    5. Click "Transform" button'

    though the Curve.StartPoint method is set as writeable via the API, this isn''t
    actually implemented by the Polyline class.


    So you''ve hit what I''d term as an edge case - I can see arguments on both sides
    as to whether the API should behave like this.

    I should have stated in the post that you need AutoCAD 2010 or higher (as PaletteSet.AddVisual()
    was added in 2010).


    You could port it to use an ElementHost - an approach shown in <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2009/08/hosting-wpf-content-inside-an-autocad-palette.html">this
    post</a> - if you need to make it work in versions prior to 2010.

    thank you for this post for me! :)


    I tried the solution with SendStringToExecute to update my own palette. And since
    I found out about the extra space behind the command, it really works perfectly.


    I was also able to help a colleage of mine, who came up with the very same problem
    within his own toolbar. This really made my day!


    Thanks

  body: 'Suggestion for a followup topic on the topic of matrix transformations: I
    am working on a custom 3dsolid sectioning routine that will work on nested blocks

    scale, rotation transformation matrix of a solid within a block in the current
    WCS.  However, I want to extend this to work with nested blocks (that is, solids
    within blocks/xrefs that are nested within other blocks/xrefs).  I have searched
    extensively online for examples of this but haven''t found anything yet.

  body: 'Hi Gavin,


    It''s almost certainly something to do with the funky WPF theme. Whether it''s
    something specific to your configuration or not remains to be seen (I don''t see
    any issues on 32-bit Vista, although I''m not in a VM).


    One thing you might try is removing the theme reference (the ResourceDictionary
    entry in UserControl.Resources in the XAML file, as mentioned in the post), to
    see if that changes anything.
