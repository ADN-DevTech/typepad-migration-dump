  body: 'Wow, really nice.

    I was wondering if Visual C# has something that could implement public properties
    to all my private members. This is really boring. Imagine a class with 20+ private
    members...


    Exactly due that I miss so much the old VC++ macros running on C#... :)


    Regards,

    Fernando.'

  body: "Hi Fernando,\n\nI just tried this... create a private member:\n\n    private\
    \ int test;\n\nRight-click on \"test\", select Refactor, and then Encapsulate\
    \ Field.\n\nSelect the default options (hit OK, then Apply), and you this gets\
    \ added to the class:\n\n    public int Test\n    {\n      get { return test;\
    \ }\n      set { test = value; }\n    }\n\nI'm not sure if that's what you're\
    \ after or not...\n\nRegards,\n\nKean"
