  body: 'I thought you''d like to know that the settings on the uvccapture page you
    linked to give some pretty atrocious results..


    this script from <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=28&t=13303">here</a>
    seems to work better:



    #!/bin/sh

    cd /home/pi/uvccapture/output

    uvccapture -v -S45 -B190 -C35 -G50 -x640 -y480 -osnap.jpg

    sleep 5

    uvccapture -v -S45 -B190 -C35 -G50 -x640 -y480 -osnap.jpg

    I was personally less worried about the quality of the results - just the fact
    the webcam actually worked. :-)


    I''m using Motion for the actual capture, on my side.


    But yes - I''m sure this info will prove very helpful for me, at some point.

  body: I find it rather unlikely that apt-get was inspired by NuGet, since it predates
    it by at least two years. Rather, package management in Linux goes back to at
    least 1994, when dpkg was released. RedHat's RPM came out in 1997. NuGet, on the
    other hand, has an initial release of 2010 (according to the Wikipedia page you
    linked, anyway.)
