  body: 'This is really two questions, IMO:


    1) Can multileaders support 3D vertices?


    I haven''t tried it myself, but the function signature does accept 3D points,
    so I assume it''s 3D-capable (rather than being planar). If it were planar, then
    you could still do it, as long as the plane it''s on intersects both points you
    mentioned.


    2) Can jigs support 3D input?


    There''s nothing to stop you defining a jig that understands point input from
    the user in 3D coordinates: the trick is to make it logical. The most logical
    way to accept 3D input is to project the point information in the jig into the
    current UCS. The "jig3d" sample on the ObjectARX SDK (under samples/graphics/jig3d)
    shows how to do this from C++ - it shouldn''t be hard to map the technique to
    .NET.


    As for arbitrary 3D mouse input... this is something that is just hard to do.
    Applications doing things like piping come across this a lot, and often solve
    it by allowing movement in one of several constrained directions that can be selected
    by clicking on glyphs that indicate the direction you want to go in. Design Review
    does much the same when sectioning 3D views.


    The other option is to just enter the coordinates via the keyboard. Which may
    very well just work with this jig, thinking about it.

  body: Does this leader work from either direction, or just one? I had to translate
    your code into VB.net, and it only appears to draw the way you show in the picture
    at the end of your article (From Left to Right). Do you know if this is a limitation
    of the translation, or of AutoCAD?

    the code. :-)


    You can negate the "dog leg" vector (making it with a positive X value rather
    than a negative one) and set it back on the multi-leader. You should only need
    to do this if it hasn''t been done before (whether when you set up the multileader
    initially or in the Update() function).
