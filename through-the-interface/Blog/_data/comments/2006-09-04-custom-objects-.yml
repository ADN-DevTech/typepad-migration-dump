    Is it possible for ObjectARX 2007 to use the Custom objects in .NET?'

  body: 'Unfortunately not: as we''re still in the planning stages the earliest release
    we''d be likely to see .NET custom objects would be 2 releases after AutoCAD 2007.
    The point of this post is to start a dialogue around the approach that would best
    address developers'' needs.

  body: 'In the interim, it might be interesting to update the current custom object
    mechanism to use some .NET features (still staying with a C++/CLI implementation).  As
    one specific example: replace the custom ARX type system with .NET''s (ARX was
    never "upgraded" to C++ in this area).


    Another step would be to allow a "ref class" to be a custom object (again, only
    in C++/CLI).


    While such things don''t specifically solve any of the problems you mention, it
    would allow more "stick time" to try out different ideas.'

  body: 'Hmm... I’m not sure I understand the advantages of using the .NET type system
    (by this I assume you mean RTTI – RunTime Type Identification – please do say
    if you actually mean something else). As you’re well aware, we had to go our own
    way with ObjectARX, as it pre-dated RTTI’s inclusion in the C++ standard (and
    – probably more importantly – compiler support for it). For us to implement .NET’s
    RTTI it feels as though we’d have to provide it in parallel to the existing one,
    as purely unmanaged clients would presumably not be able to harness it. One concern
    would be how this would affect AutoCAD’s memory footprint (and impact performance).


    I’d certainly like to understand your suggestions better – please post a follow-up
    or email me directly.

  body: 'I can understand the notion of lowering the entry barrier, making simple
    tasks easier to implement and it may be true that many developers don''t need
    the complete functionality of ObjectARX but just a subset of its features.


    On the other hand, at our company we really make heavy use of ObjectARX and I
    doubt there are many features we aren''t using or even requiring.


    We have many custom entities which interact with and rely on each other. They
    store and manage custom information and specialized behaviour. They also interact
    with our databases and more.


    So for us, a .NET API to AutoCAD will have to support most of ObjectARX'' functionality
    in order to be a viable alternative to ObjectARX. At least for any non-trivial
    applications.


    Will we be able to do as much with a .NET API?


    Of course, this doesn''t have to be achieved in the same way as with ObjectARX,
    as it probably would be beneficial to make use of .NET features (like introspection/reflection
    which C++ doesn''t have yet). Otherwise, what use would .NET be? ;)


    It''s an interesting topic. Please keep us updated on thoughts and progress within
    the AutoCAD team, if possible. ;)'

  body: 'Hi Dale,


    We don''t have plans to expose the ability to define custom objects to .NET: we
    believe that the vast majority of use cases are handled by the Overrule API, and
    the inherent complexity of implementing custom objects would not be lessened by
    exposing the C++ mechanism to .NET.


    People comfortable with this complexity can, of course, implement custom objects
    using C++ and expose COM or .NET interfaces for them to be used from other languages.

    It provides all the capabilities but doesn''t encourage (or allow) you to lock
    away your custom data in binary blobs that add a dependency on an object enabler.
