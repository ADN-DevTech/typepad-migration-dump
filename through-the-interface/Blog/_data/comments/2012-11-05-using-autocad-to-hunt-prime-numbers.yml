    the links behind the images are OK, but all links to docs.google.com are dead.
    Common problem or only dead for me?

    They work for me: for the larger doanload sizes you may need to click through
    a couple of links ("Download" and "Download anyway") to get to the actual download,
    though.


    Hopefully someone else will be able to confirm they''ve had success downloading
    the images.

    BTW:

    The user can login with Twitter, Facebook and many other accounts - but not with  "Xing".
    Is it planned to add it?

    Do you mean for posting blog comments? I have no idea what TypePad''s plan is
    with regards to allowing authentication via Xing - this is unfortunately not something
    that''s under my control in any way.
