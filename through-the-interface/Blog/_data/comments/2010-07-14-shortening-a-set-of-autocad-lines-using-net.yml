    \              cur.HandOverTo(ent, true, true);\n              tr.AddNewlyCreatedDBObject(ent,\

    \              objs[2].Dispose();\n\nit works. Although I do find that it's up\
    \ to the ObjectARX application to delete the old object in ObjectARX document."

    Interesting, thanks.


    I''m not sure why this would be different on x64, to be honest, but it''s good
    to know what worked for you.


    Regards,
