  body: We was researching for solution to our project while unerasing object in Database_ObjectErased
    caused total crash and using CommandEnded to restore object didnt look like so
    elegant solution. Thank you again of good blog post!

  body: "Hello Kean,\n\nis there a way to prevent certain objects from being plotted?\
    \ I know I coud use a Layer for that, but... they should be on the Layer, wich\
    \ the containing BlockRef is inserted to.\nSo I have a 3dPolyline nested in a\
    \ Block. I need to see it in Modelspace, since it shows a clearence boundary but\
    \ do not want it to be plotted... (Actually, lot of blocks feature such a line,\
    \ so simple blockdef modification on Plotcommand would be a performance-killer)\
    \ I hoped to find an Obejct Property \"mypoly.plottable\", or so... \nMaybe an\
    \ Overrule? Is the plot command triggering any event for overrule?\n\nThanks in\
    \ advance,\nDaniel"

  body: 'Hello Daniel,


    There''s no direct event, but you might be able to use a DrawableOverrule that
    nulls out the objects to hide (by not calling the base Worldraw() method) and
    only gets added when the PLOT command starts.


    Cheers,

  body: Hi Kean, In our application user inserts standard blocks from toolpalatte.
    But after inserting them they can redefine the blocks. How can we restrict user
    from refining blocks. Can any overrule be applied to blocks so that user can't
    redefine blocks.

    I haven''t yet found a workable way to prevent block redefinition, unfortunately.

  body: 'How can I implement a restriction to erase certain kind of polylines.

    Let''s say sewer pipes that are indeed polylines with some Xrecord attached to
    it (diameter, material, installation date, etc).


    I would like to avoid deleting polylines with those attributes but enable deletion
    of conventional polylines.

    Thanks'
