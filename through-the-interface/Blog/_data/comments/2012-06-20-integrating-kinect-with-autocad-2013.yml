    Is there any software out right now that utilize the Kinect technology for scanning
    and exporting it out as dwg file for autocad to work with in 3D rather than going
    through multiple 3rd party softwares to get a less than satisfying result? Or
    does Autodesk have any?


    Thanks,


    Donnie'

    The app presented in this post does just that (although there''s a more recent
    one with the Kinect SDK 1.6), in that - among other things - it generates a PCG
    file linked to AutoCAD from a static scene captured by Kinect.


    KinectFusion is being added to the Kinect SDK: I''m hopeful that''s going to provide
    some interesting "painting" capabilities to this app, in time. But we''ll see
    what that provides.


    Cheers,

    Where would I go to get this app for autocad ?

    I wouldn''t mind messing around at home scanning objects, modelling them and spitting
    them out of my printer ?'

    You could get the source from <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2013/10/kinect-fusion-updated-to-include-colour.html">the
    latest post on this topic</a> and build it with the Kinect for Windows SDK 1.8,
    if you know how to build a C# app.


    Otherwise you might just want to use one of the Kinect Fusion SDK samples (again,
    installed with the Kinect for Windows 1.8 SDK) to capture a mesh and output some
    STL.


    Have you also tried 123D Catch or ReCap Photo?
