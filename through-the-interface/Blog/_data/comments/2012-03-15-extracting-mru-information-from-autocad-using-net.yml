  body: 'There''s also the Application.RecentDocuments property which returns an IEnumerable&#060;RecentDocument&#062;.
    The RecentDocument objects contains all the relevant properties.


    I checked it in AutoCAD 2012, and the last entry seems erroneous to me when compared
    with the list shown in the UI application menu. But easy enough to just ignore
    that element.

  body: 'I realize this is an old post but I''d be very interested in seeing an example
    of a successful open/dowork/close script using the core console. I''m developing
    an application that needs to touch a large number of drawings and I''ve been unable
    to get open/close working in a single script. Close command seems to crash the
    console and open simply fails.


    Currently I''m having to run acadcoreconsole.exe /s filename /s script.scr through
    a whole list of files. Works, but is inelegant and (I imagine) slower than running
    one instance of core and on a single script that does the appropriate open/close
    commands. Would be quite interested in your thoughts.'

  body: 'Hi David,


    You''ve hit on the intended approach for processing multiple files: running a
    core console instance for each.


    Now if you only need RealDWG-like access (i.e. you can live with the more limited
    capabilities you have by using just AcDbMgd.dll and not AcCoreMgd.dll), then you
    can "side load" a sequence of drawings via a .NET-implemented command loaded in
    a single core console instance and process them that way.


    Cheers,


    Kean'

    ''RegistryProductRootKey'' is not a member of ''Autodesk.AutoCAD.DatabaseServices.HostApplicationServices''.


    I''m using VS 2010 Express, testing for AutoCAD 2013 (mechanical). my reference
    dll versions are:

    accoremgd.dll - 19.0.55.0.0 (826 kb)

    acdbmgd.dll - 19.0.55.0.0 (6.07 mb)

    acmgd.dll - 19.0.55.0.0 (2.28 mb)


    I have tries .Net 4.0/3.5 (+client) including C# environment, if this is matter'

  body: 'Hi Sam,


    As explained in the post, in AutoCAD 2013 that API was replaced with two variants.
    The one you choose depends on the section of the Registry you''re interested in:


    HostApplicationServices.Current.UserRegistryProductRootKey

    HostApplicationServices.Current.MachineRegistryProductRootKey


    I hope this helps,
