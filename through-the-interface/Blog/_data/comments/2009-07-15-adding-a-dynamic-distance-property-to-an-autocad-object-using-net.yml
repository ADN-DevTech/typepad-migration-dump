    which is part of acmgd.dll.

    In the inc-directory I found AcPexCtl16.tlb which contains several propertyeditors.
    Maybe there is a more elegant method than retrieving the progid from the registry.'

    Yes, that TypeLib is there, but the problem remains that we need to identify the
    appropriate ProgId for the control we''re using (something that''s not very obvious
    from the TypeLib, at least not to me).


    At the end of the day identifying the ProgId is a one-off, design-time process:
    nothing is being retrieved programmatically at runtime, so elegance isn''t really
    a significant factor.

  body: 'You need to use a development environment that generates a .NET assembly
    DLL from C# code (such as Visual Studio or Visual C# Express) and then reference
    the managed AutoCAD assemblies (AcMgd.dll, AcDbMgd.dll and AcTcMgd.dll). The asdkOPMNetExt.dll
    will need to have been NETLOADed (although I don''t believe an assembly reference
    to it is needed in the C# project).

    You don''t make those DLLs from this code: you reference them from your .NET Class
    Library project.


    I suggest starting by looking at the introductory resources on <a href="http://www.autodesk.com/developautocad">the
    AutoCAD Developer Center</a> - these will help you get started before attempting
    something more complex such as the technique shown in this post.
