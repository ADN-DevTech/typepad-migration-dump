  body: Hello Kean, nice post. Do you know which interpolation method Civil 3d uses
    to create the smooth contours of the surfaces objects?

    Good question. Unfortunately I don''t (although I''ll bet <a href="http://civilizeddevelopment.typepad.com">Isaac</a>
    does).


    I wish I''d thought to use the interpolate in my post, but hopefully it now being
    in a comment will help people find it if used as a search keyword, anyway. :-)


    Regards,

  body: 'Hi Bang,


    Glad you like it. :-)


    I''m sorry - I don''t fully understand the requirement. Maybe if you email me
    a drawing I can give it a try (if I think it''s of general interest to people
    - otherwise I may well suggest going to the discussion groups to ask there).
