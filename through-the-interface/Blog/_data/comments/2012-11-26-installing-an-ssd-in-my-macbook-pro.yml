  body: "Hi Sean,\n\nI don't want to wreck your enthusiasm, but I feel like sharing\
    \ my conclusions on this matter.\n\nAs far as my personal experience goes, it\
    \ seems that these SSD dives are not yet fully mature as technology (my IT guys\
    \ don't want to hear about), and they are prone to strange and unpredictable behavior\
    \ once in a while.\n\nI have one of those for a little more than one year now\
    \ (running under Windows 7) and although it's amazing how fast the system boots\
    \ and the applications load and run, I had a few little surprises here and there,\
    \ like crashing when switching users or just out of the blue and rebooting through\
    \ the night with a “Non-system disk or disk error; \nReplace and strike any key\
    \ when ready” message, which disappears if I reboot the system one more time!\n\
    \nThis is why I keep it strictly as a boot and apps drive, saving and archiving\
    \ anything else on a second HDD.\n\nAnd maybe it's not bad to mention also that\
    \ among other issues, SSD failures are often catastrophic, with total data loss,\
    \ because unlike the HDD, they don't really give warnings about imminent failure,\
    \ so don't forget to save and to back-up on a regular basis :)\nI thought it's\
    \ not bad a bad idea to mention all these issues, just in case :)\n\nConstantin"

  body: 'Hi Constantin,


    That''s fair to mention - thanks for bringing this up.


    This is certainly one area where it makes sense to pay a bit more for a reputable
    brand (one of the reasons I ended up going with Intel). I haven''t personally
    seen any issues, as yet, but will certainly report back if I do.


    You always need a solid backup strategy - irrespective of whether you rely on
    SSD or not - I would hope that''s considered a given, at this stage.


    Cheers,


    Kean'

  body: 'Kean, thx for the article, I had not noticed the caddy idea and am now going
    to do that on my laptop.


    I have a question, slightly off topic. I rarely go off topic, right? :)  I want
    to get the lightest computer that will let me program in visual studio. What is
    the smallest machine you have run into that will run visual studio? Could be a
    tablet, that is ok.

    thanks'

  body: 'Hi James,


    I''ve seen VS2012 being run on dockable slates (presumably with Intel chips) -
    something Microsoft were keen to demonstrate, of course. :-)


    I''d look at the current and upcoming "Pro" tablets that support desktop apps,
    if you''re looking for something similar.
