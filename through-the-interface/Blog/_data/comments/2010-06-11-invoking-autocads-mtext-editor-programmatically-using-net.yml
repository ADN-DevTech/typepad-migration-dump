  body: Thanks for this interesting post. I have a related request\suggestion. Since
    we're able to customize the "Text Editor Contextual Tab" in the CUI, how could
    we have a button\command send a string to the IPE? For example you double click
    on an Mtext object, place the courser somewhere in the IPE, then hit a button
    on the ribbon that would add some text at your courser location.

  body: 'There''s a lot that''s been done in the MText IPE in AutoCAD 2011 to support
    just this. I''m going to write a few posts based on techniques shown in one of
    the samples from the <a href="http://download.autodesk.com/media/adn/ACAD2011NewAPIWebcast_13Apr10.zip">AutoCAD
    2011 New APIs</a> webcast material (accessible from <a href="http://www.adskconsulting.com/adn/cs/api_course_webcast_archive.php">our
    webcast archive</a>).


    More soon...
