  body: 'Hi Chris,


    I certainly hit this behaviour during my recent "point gathering" exercise, and
    ended up living with determining the accurate bounds of the text (which was sufficient
    for my needs).


    I''m curious to know more about what you''re after... can you elaborate? I understand
    you want the geometry, but for what specific purpose?


    Cheers,

  body: 'Specifically, I need to convert the text into lines and curves. The trouble
    I run into is with AutoCAD Architecture. My current project is a product configurator
    for cabinetry, and part of what it does is insert and automatic label and dimension
    so the users don''t have to manually lable. However in Architecture, when you
    create an elevation view in a room, it does not include any text or dimension
    objects in the 2d output, forcing me to try and make the labels as collections
    of lines or curves so they show up in the evelavation drawings.

    In my seach I''ve also found that there are quite a few people who want to convert
    text objects to lines and curves to use with CAM softwares.

    I''ve almost given up on trying to find an answer, but I though I would ask since
    its somewhat relevent to the article.'

    I''ve just discovered the TXTEXP (former Express Tools) command. Can you give
    that a try and see how it works for you?

  body: 'How about just getting the text string from mtext?

    I have a lisp for that but its imperfect.

    If we could get the string without formatting, we could modify the string and
    still preserve formatting because now we can tell what is format info and what
    is the resulting text.  I have 20 or so text routines that do things like modify
    first number found, match text, round numbers in text, and so on.  these work
    on text, mtext, and attributes, but are not dependable on mtext due to the detecting
    formatting characters issue.'

  body: I had looked at this, the express tools explode text lisp command, it actually
    works by exporting the text object to a WMF and then importing it back into the
    database. Apart from some weird scaling issues it works, but I cannot find the
    same functionality in the .Net API.

    ExplodeFragments() does provide you access to the text string without formatting
    codes.


    Or am I missing something?

    Is there any way by which we can convert Text into line/arc using RealDWG toolkit?
