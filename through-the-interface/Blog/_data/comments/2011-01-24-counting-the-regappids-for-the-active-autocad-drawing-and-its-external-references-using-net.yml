  body: 'Another item that will be needed, and seems to fit nicely within the topic
    of gathering info on unopene drawings, is that of gathering xref paths.

    When we modify scriptpro, we will have to add a column to list the app ids count.

    We need that, because the next step will be selecting those "dirty" files, and
    picking a button that says "add xrefs for selected files to the list".

    So we need the ability to gather the xref paths, verify the files exist, and add
    them to the grid.

    Then we run that again on the dirty files that iteration added, until no dirty
    files get added.

    You also would want to have the cleaning process run via backgroundworker, so
    we could reliably show and cancel its progress.

    Some other features that have proven very useful are:

    1) allow backup of files to a folder before purge

    2) add files via a text file list of paths

    3) select items as "to do" based on some app id count

    4) button to copy selected items path to the clipboard

    5) button to copy selected files to a folder

    6) option to preserve file date modified and attributes, so purging does not cause
    backup systems to back up tons of files if not desired.

  body: 'The code I''ve prototyped for the XML portion does gather the path (via the
    Filename property of the xdb variable).


    So you''ll be able to implement your own logic for purging individual files (which
    may or may not be addressed by this series of posts).


    How you launch the purge process is up to you, but as it''ll be run by a seperate
    process (acad.exe) there''s not really any benefit from using a background worker,
    as far as I can tell.


    As mentioned, the main focus of this series is on the reporting side of things:
    all the items you''ve mentioned on the purge side of things are altogether possible
    (as I''m sure you know) and will likely be left as an exercise for the reader.

  body: 'oh, you did gather xref paths, I need to read the code :)

    I forgot the scriptpro code was available too, so now i see why you picked it
    as a starting point.  the only issue with it is I am totally green on wpf, and
    am just getting down the patterns needed to do databinding.
