  body: 'Kean, that little calandar on the top left of your page is so handy, but
    only works for current month.

    Any way to make it appear for previous months when you want to look back?


    Thx a ton for your blog.'

  body: 'James,


    It seems TypePad ony supports showing the last n months on each post. So I''ve
    changed the sidebar to include the last 3 months, which seems a reasonable timeframe.


    It''s not ideal, but that''s the only real option, unfortunately.


    Regards,


    Kean
