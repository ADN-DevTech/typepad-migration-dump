    studio express editions anyways :P

  body: Being a complete beginner myself, and I don't know what a wizard is either,
    code samples (snippets?) would be great. After all it's your code samples in this
    blog that have helped me learn the little I know about VB.NET. I have a limited
    time to complete my project so mastering ObjectARX, .NET, VB, and all those other
    acronyms just isn't in the cards. Cut and pastes from code samples so I have something
    to show, then I can go back and learn the details to take it to the next level.
    I know, not the way it should be done...

  body: 'I think the reason that Wizards aren''t terribly useful in managed languages
    is mainly due to the ease with which Visual Studio allows you to turn an existing
    project into a template, which may contain commonly-used code.


    For example, I start with one of several project templates, each of which referencs
    the AutoCAD assemblies I need, and my own commonly-used shared assemblies.


    Most of my project templates also come with a class template that implements IExtensionApplication,
    and another for command methods as well, all with the needed attributes already
    defined.'

  body: I think a new project wizard is an absolute necessity for *any* language.
    Beyond that I agree that, for the .NET languages at least, code samples and snippets
    are probably more useful to the average programmer.

  body: Code samples definitely. Wizards can be good in some specific case but I find
    samples are better for multiple cases. I've also had wizards fail to many times
    when the development environments don't completely math up.

  body: 'Here''s a "push the envelope" thought: every time you write a code sample
    (or wizard, for that matter), ask "should there be something to support this in
    the API?"


    Much of the current .NET API is largely a (thin) managed wrapper over ObjectARX;
    there isn''t a lot of additional functionality.  Much of the "goodness" comes
    from simply using .NET, not the .NET API itself.


    Code samples are the most primitive form of code reuse: cut-and-paste.  Abstracting
    those ideas into an API could provide a lot of long term value.'

  body: I would have to vote for samples and code snippets as being more useful. I
    can integrate those into my coding style more easily than wizards. I also like
    the idea of a high level API for the .NET managed classes. I am developing something
    simialr to this so our design engineers who are familiar with VBA can use a ThisDrawing.Poroperty
    or ThisDrawing.Method() API within .NET. This will be particularly useful when
    moving between 32 bit and 64 bit environments.

  body: 'To my opinion there is no good answer to that question ;) Both address a
    different need and target a different audience. Wizards are mainly for beginners
    and used for repetitive tasks by advanced programmers.

    - Wizards for beginners because using a code snippet from someone else in a different
    context may not work as is and cause more disatisfaction than it helps. Beginners
    want to learn, not to fight with project settings and context to get something
    to work.

    - Wizards for repetitive tasks for more advanced programmers, because people are
    lazy and as long they know what wizards are doing it simplify coding and save
    time.

    - Code snippet for everything else because no wizards ever will be able to demonstrate
    everything. Wizards are there for basic and repetitive things. They aren''t for
    showning how to use one API or another.

    - That reminds me the fight between Linux fan and Windows user about configuration
    Wizards. The discussion was would Microsoft be able to create Wizards for every
    possible configurable option in Windows. The answer is no even if they did a lot.
    It is the same here ;)


    So my vote is both with a good understanding where should be the limit for the
    Wizards.
