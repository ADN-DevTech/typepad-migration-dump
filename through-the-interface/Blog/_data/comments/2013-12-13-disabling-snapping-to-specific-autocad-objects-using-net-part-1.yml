  body: 'Is it possible thru code like this to prevent a user from creating anything
    that is not inserted, drawn or connected to an osnap? I.E. A way to make sure
    a user is always drawing things that are connected to other objects via OSNAP?
    Use case is where someone is not drawing accurately this would only allow them
    to place items via OSNAP settings and not miss endpoints and such. (Obviously
    some times you have to, but it would be like training wheels for people drafting)


    Just a thought..'

  body: 'Can you be a bit more specific? Is it meant to show permanently irrespective

    (You should really post this type of question to the AutoCAD .NET Discussion Group,
    by the way, as it''s only tangentially related to this post.)

  body: 'Hi Athier,


    So you mean show the possible places you might snap to, without actually moving
    the cursor over the objects?


    You could certainly query all the objects for their osnap points and then use
    transient graphics to display glyphs at those locations. I''m not sure you could
    query the glyph associated with a particular mode, and so may need to "hardcode"
    that behaviour yourself.


    Assuming that''s what you want, of course - it''s still not fully clear to me.


    Regards,


    Kean
