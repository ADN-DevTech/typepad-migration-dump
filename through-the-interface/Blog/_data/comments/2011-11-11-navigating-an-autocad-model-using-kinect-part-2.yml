  body: Sounds as practical as a screen door in a submarine.  Maybe you could work
    on making navigation of an AutoCAD drawing possible with a 3Dconnexion device.  Nobody
    at Autodesk seems to be able to do that since they took over development of it
    with release 2011.

  body: 'Is there really any need for that kind of cynicism, Bill?


    It''s not part of my role to implement device drivers (but the techniques I''m
    showing could certainly be used to implement some kind of navigation capability
    for a 3D mouse), nor is it to re-engineer submarines. But it is my hope that my
    posts will lead to someone else developing the next generation periscope (OK,
    maybe the submarine analogy is starting to stretch a little thin :-).
