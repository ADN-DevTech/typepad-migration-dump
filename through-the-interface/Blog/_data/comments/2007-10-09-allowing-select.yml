    i am doing is the same as yours.


    I can get a dsd publish to do multiple page dwfs, though.


    Overall, your site and the .net discussion group has helped a lot, i would say
    i have learned 40 to 60 % of the api from them.'

    the technique.


    The Publish API may be the way to go, if you need to create multi-page DWF6 files
    (I haven''t looked into it myself, as yet).

    Unfortunately if the device is not avaliable it takes quite a few seconds to load
    the info.


    AutoCAD’s page setup manager does not appear to have to load the device in order
    to get the info.'

  body: 'Hi Kean,


    Reactivating this topic.. Hope you read it, and maybe can help me.


    I''m working on a App to plot in PLT, PDF or DWF. The choice is made by user selection
    (Windows Form + Radio Button).


    I''m having problem with the MediaName.

    Although I''ve manually included the medias manually in the .PC3 file (for the
    three devices), things still don''t work..

    For PLT (using HP-750C), thats OK, but I had to use your piece of code to list
    medianames, because the name I''ve created is not the same. I''ve created someting
    like: A0, A1, A0L, etc... But in medianame listing it apears like: UserDefinedMetric
    (900.00 x 2500.00MM), UserDefinedMetric (900.00 x 2000.00MM), etc...


    For DWF, no matter the medianame, it gives me an "eInvalidInput", and breaks...


    For PDF, although the custom sizes i''ve created, even in medianame listing, it
    just don''t appear...


    If I set the BACKGROUNDPLOT=0, it doesn''t plot... If set to 2, then it takes
    long, but generates the files...


    Hope you can help me...


    Thank you very much!

    The kind of troubleshooting you need is beyond what I can provide, I''m afraid.
    The ADN team will be able to help, if you''re a member, otherwise I suggest trying
    the the discussion groups.

  body: 'Thanks Kean,


    An workaround that I choose using is plotting via `doc.SendStringToExecute(command
    "._plot" "Y" ... ... )`


    The only issue I''ve found was that both PDF and DWF are "auto-plot-to-file",
    but not the PLT via HP750C.pc3. So I''ve set a global variable "bool autoplottofile",
    so that depending of the device i''m using, the command will have an "parameter"
    diference.


    But no problems with delay, medianames, etc..


    Hope this helps..


    Thanks!'

    Is there a way to tell if the device the user picks requires you to print to file?
    The pe.BeginDocument function throws an exception if you choose a file device
    like a PDF, and you don''t give it a filename. I could catch the error at that
    point and prompt for a file name from the user, but I was hoping there was a way
    to tell before that point.'

    \ \nThe media list contains for example:\n11 User122\n12 User121\n13 User120\n\

    It''s been a while (wow, 5 years!) since I looked at this post, but off the top
    of my head I would say that decision is based on the media chosen (look at options
    17 and 18 for the two orientations for A4, for instance).


    If that''s not what you''re looking for, please post your question via ADN or
    the AutoCAD .NET Discussion Group.
