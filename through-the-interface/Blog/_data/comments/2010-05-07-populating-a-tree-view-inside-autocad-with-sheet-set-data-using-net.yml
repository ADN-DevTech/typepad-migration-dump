  body: Nice example... I was just thinking about the same thing the other day since
    I did a class at AU last year on the Sheet Set API and using VB.NET/C#.  Most
    of my content focused on how to simply manipulate sheet sets and not emulating
    the UI, but did get a few questions on if it could be done.

  body: "\"(although the WPF TreeView doesn’t appear to support data-binding, so I\
    \ may well decide not to bother)\"\n\nUm.... Not sure what gives you that impression.\
    \ In WPF, pretty much everything supports data binding both directly, and via\
    \ templates. It's just a more sophisticated form of Data Binding. \n\nThe template\
    \ most commonly used to bind data to Treeview items is the HierarchicalDataTemplate.\n\
    \nThis article has a good introduction to the basic concepts:\n\n<a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc700358.aspx\"\

  body: 'Yes - my mistake. I Googled it and came across <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms996437.aspx">an
    MSDN article</a> including a section on "Designing a Data-Bound Tree View" but
    didn''t spot that a) it had been written in 2002 and b) it was about WinForms,
    not WPF.


    Thanks for the clarification - I''ll follow up with a WPF version when I get the
    chance.

    That''s right: it only shows a limited set of the data from the DST.


    As I''m not an AUGI member I don''t have access to the screenshot image, but I''ve
    put together a post that will be published on Friday that should help.

  body: "That screenshot shows a tool that has a 'debug' view option, that was active\
    \ when the image was grabbed.  \n\nThat's definitiely not a user-oriented presentation,\
    \ and was intended mainly for use by sheetset API programmers, to visualize the\
    \ 'raw' sheetset database graph.\n\nCopies of that screenshot and another, showing\

    \nPerhaps the second image is more like what you have in mind?  If so, it's not\
    \ too difficult to extend what Kean posted to do that, but if you plan on adding\
    \ a lot of your own functionality to it, taking the 'big switch' approach to populating\
    \ the control's content probably isn't the best approach, because that can easily\
    \ turn into spaghetti.\n\nWhat you might consider doing is studying the MVM (Model-View-Mapping)\
    \ and MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)  design patterns, which provide a way to establish\
    \ a clean seperation between business objects and a UI, and also promote the use\
    \ of more structured, data-driven approaches to providing a UI with content.\n\
    \nWhile MVM and MVVM are core concepts in WPF, you can also use them with WinForms-based\
    \ applications too, although WinForms has no built-in support for those patterns,\
    \ as WPF does. \n\nThe app you see in the referenced screenshots uses MVVM to\
    \ deliver sheetset object data to the UI layer."

    I''m glad you did, thanks.


    Yep, the second screenshot is pretty darn close to what I envision for my own
    needs, with some additional stuff added which we store in custom properties shown
    in the tree.


    I think Kean''s follow up will be helpful for that, and I''ll also look into the
    MVMVVM (or whatever that was... lol) stuff too.


    Also curious as to how you are able to get your app''s data to appear in Vista''s
    Explorer. That''s pretty cool.


    I''ve searched on that but all I found was a control requiring Windows 7, that
    shows the Explorer''s file list in a .NET form, but I think that''s the opposite
    of what your app is doing.


    I asked a colleage of mine about that and he mentioned something about ''shell
    namespace extensions''. I researched them and found some info but it seemed to
    pertain to C++ and COM, and was all ''Chinese'' to me :)


    Thanks again'

    Yes - if you follow the instructions just after the code (to add a user control
    to your peoject with a tree view inside), then that should solve the issue.
