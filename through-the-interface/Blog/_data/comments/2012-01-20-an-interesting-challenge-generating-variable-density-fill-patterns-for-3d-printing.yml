  body: 'This is an interesting subject. The one thing I have to wonder about is how
    a Gcode producing application would handle this geometric fill. The application
    I use to generate the Gcode from the STL file for my MakerBot is ReplicatorG.


    Cheers,

  body: 'Alex is fooling around with that, right now: he has generated some .gcode
    using Inventor (with a lot of manual modelling to apply the pattern we''ll see
    in tomorrow''s post as an extruded fill), and then visualised it using <a href="http://blog.ponoko.com/2011/12/29/visualizing-gcode-in-windows/">this
    tool</a>.


    Once he''s finished building his REPRAP 3D printer, we''ll find out how it builds!

  body: 'I should clarify that I didn''t produce the resultant .gcode file from Inventor
    itself (although it would be a cool project to try!); That was done using an exported
    .stl file with the <a href="https://github.com/repetier/Repetier-Host/wiki">Repetier-Host
    software</a> which has <a href="http://www.slic3r.org/">slic3r</a> built-in.

  body: 'Alex and Kean, I am be very happy to play a part in this funny question.
    I write some Lisp code to draw this pattern in theswamp''s topic, and I hope I
    can do some further work for the irregular polygon.

    BTW, Kean, in your website, I learn a lot of .Net skill. Thank you very much.'
