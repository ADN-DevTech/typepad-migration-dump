  body: intersting interviews. I would sure like to hear you ask these kinds of guys
    how often they switch versions of AutoDesk software. I would bet they do not have
    a cad manager to coordinate things, just a good user or two. I usually find the
    answers shocking, like "we update the day new stuff comes out" or "we are 4 versions
    back because no one knows how to install things". For me its updating custom tools
    or replacing things that Land Desktop had, that Civil 3D does not. Easy sharing
    of data in particular. I think minds like yours would be useful in reviewing what
    users did before some feature, and what after. We need a few clones of you to
    visit workplaces, see their workflows, and understand the usually small issues
    that leverage what we use and avoid in real production.

  body: 'Thanks for the input, James.


    The interview did actually go beyond these two, edited-down parts: I captured
    some additional information that I''ve shared with various product teams within
    Autodesk (and data interop did come up, although in this case between Alias and
    an externally-developed package).


    I think what''s ideal in these situations is that someone visits who has relevant
    domain knowledge. With a bit of research I was able to ask a few intelligent-sounding
    questions, but that''s no substitute for someone with a solid background in the
    user''s domain (and we do have people asking those questions regularly of out
    customers, even if that information isn''t being blogged about publicly).


    Cheers,

  body: I have sure tried to teach the C3D team about data sharing and object models,
    they do not have the "room" to listen though. They comprehend, sure, they are
    super smart guys and gals, the change never happens though. Its the pursuit of
    Caltrans or bust. There is huge potential to get back the private development
    engineering crowd, they seem to have given up though.

  body: 'I don''t have any huge insights into this particular industry, but I see
    a lot of progress being made with InfraWorks. So data sharing is up there as a
    priority, but perhaps it''s being delivered in a different way. But again - not
    my personal area of focus, so it''s not something I can easily respond to.

  body: "Imagine this - Land Desktop allowed connection to an external database. You\
    \ got access to lots of objects, say alignments and surfaces, for no cost. The\
    \ tools only accessed the data when needed to do something. When you did need\
    \ access, all the data was there. With Civil3D, there is no \"free\" data access.\
    \ you are forced to pull in a graphical, reactive object for each object you want.\
    \ That makes things chat for no reason. In a sheet, you might not need too many\
    \ alignments pulled in, but when designing in a base file, you do need access\
    \ to all data on a regular basis. Late in the game, like 3 releases from first,\
    \ they came up with the ability to label xreffed objects. That is not good enough\
    \ unfortunately. If you can believe this, any labels placed that reference that\
    \ xreffed file, DISAPPEAR if the xref is detached. Its completely fragile, but\
    \ where does an industry of people that used LDT for so long, go? Its a disaster.\
    \ The progress in IW is irrelevent. That environment is not precise enough or\
    \ suited to design yet. You cannot snap to things, make lines/arcs for reference,\
    \ and even pull in linework from a dwg base. The ideas going on for road design\
    \ are good, but that poor team is fragmented and stuck on DOT's. They need an\
    \ overall programmer that is hooked up with industry to redo the sharing, and\
    \ I have a working example of how it could be done, with all the advantages (and\
    \ disadvantages) I predicted. But who does your team trust? That got lost in the\
    \ economic slowdown, and is killing the civil side now. \n-----"
