    to be an older version than the one I''ve code against).


    Try just passing 0 instead of System.IntPtr.Zero.

  body: "Hello Kean,\n\nI´ve got a generally question to the use of block references\
    \ and their attributes. I´ve developed a little interface with objectarx 2012\
    \ and C# for insuring and editing specific blocks which contain several text attributes.\
    \ Most of them are not visible in the drawing. Two of them are called ZEILE_1\
    \ and ZEILE_2 and they are visible. We need these blocks to code the components\
    \ of P&IDs. I´ve created two different kinds of blocks which are mostly the same\
    \ the only difference is the position of the visible attributes.\nSo now my questions:\n\
    I´ve implemented a command to move the ZEILE_1 and ZEILE_2 of all block references\
    \ in the drawing by setting a int value for x and y. This command works fine for\
    \ one kind of my blocks for the other block I get no error message but the position\
    \ didn't change. I´ve compare several attribute properties such as \"lockposition\"\
    \ but for both blocks they have all the same values. I don´t know, why I can´t\
    \ set the attribute position of the one block. Which attribute property should\
    \ I change to make this work? Or could it be a property of block or the block\
    \ reference? Or is their a simply way to set all properties of the one block to\
    \ the other block? \nThe second question is. Is their a switch to set the attributes\
    \ only for the drawing invisible? I´ve I set the visible property of attributes\
    \ \"TRUE\" I can´t see the attribute also in the attribute editor.\n\nI hope you\
    \ can help me.\n\nHave a creat remaining christmas time!\n\ngreetings robert"

    Happy New Year!


    This question doesn''t relate directly to this post, and should therefore really
    be submitted via ADN (if you''re a member) or otherwise to the AutoCAD .NET Discussion
    Group.


    Thanks for understanding,
