  body: 'Hi Wallace,


    The current version of the DWF Toolkit (7.3) already supports 64-bit Windows versions.
    I don''t know for sure, but I would expect 7.4 to do the same.


    I haven''t yet worked with 7.4, but will add this to my list of future posts to
    work on (no promises, though, I''m afraid).
