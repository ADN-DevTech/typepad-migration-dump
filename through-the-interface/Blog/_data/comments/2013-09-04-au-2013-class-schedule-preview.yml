  body: Hmmm... I don't see anything specific on the new javascript API for 2014 unless
    it's part of the "DV1518 - Programming Autodesk® PLM 360 Using REST" or the "DV2258
    - Introduction to Android™ Development" courses... any thoughts as to whether
    anyone plans on doing something with this?  This would be a good time to introduce
    it.

  body: 'I agree completely. I was sure Fenton or Philippe were presenting something
    on JavaScript. I''ll ping the ADN team and check if they''re planning something.


    As an ADN member you should come to the DevLab - I''ll talk to Stephen Preston
    about making sure we have someone there who can show a few things (I''ll attend
    if I don''t have a clash, which was the case last year).

    like a good year with lots of new topics.

    watch Philippe''s DevTV on JavaScript to keep yourself amused - <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZKKJwcke2k">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZKKJwcke2k</a>
