  body: "Hi Kean, \n    This looks really good, but I was wondering if there's scope\
    \ for creating exactly the same functionality for Inventor 2010? We regularly\
    \ create final drawings in Inventor, and a lot of the fields are the same on every\
    \ page. (to head off the \"why not use custom/automatic fields\" questions, we\
    \ simply can't because of our customer's requirements*)\n\nCurrently, we're left\
    \ with having to use the MS Office clipboard which is a pain as it's not on by\
    \ default.\n\nI suppose given that you've already done most of the leg work (and\
    \ posted the code), it wouldn't be too much trouble to convert it to an Inventor\
    \ Add-in?\n\nThanks,\n\nAlex."

  body: 'Hi Alex,


    That''s a very interesting suggestion.


    Most of the code is independent of AutoCAD: the AutoCAD-specific stuff is related
    to the application initialization & demand-loading, the hosting of the palette
    and the sending of commands to paste the contents of the clipboard. The rest is
    pretty generic, and could be adapted for other host applications pretty easily
    (I believe).


    I''l have a word with my team, to get someone to take a look, but you may also
    want to give it a try yourself, in the meantime.


    Regards,
