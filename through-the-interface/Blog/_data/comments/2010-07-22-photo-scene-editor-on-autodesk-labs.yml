  body: 'Kean,


    To do this for a room from inside you have 2 options:


    1- Put the camera at the center and rotate it

    2- Move the camera around the room boundary facing the room''s center


    In your case (your head) you have used option 2 because you wanted an outside
    view of the subject. Have your tried to do this with a room from its center? Were
    the results good enough as the Laser scanner option you did with your room?


    Regards.'

    I mean, is it the same like Photosynth (Bundler)?


    Is there an API for the Photofly Web Service?'

  body: This looks really good Kean, can't wait to put it to the test. :) And, like
    Tilo, I'm really interested in the technology behind it.

    I suggest giving it a try, and if it doesn''t work then you should send an email
    to <a href="mailto:labs.photofly@autodesk.com">the feedback alias</a>.
