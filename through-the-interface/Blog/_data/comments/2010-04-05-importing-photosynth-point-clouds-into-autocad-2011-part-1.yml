    Without having tried it myself, just how usable are the point clouds once they''re
    imported into AutoCAD?


    I''m guessing that each ''point cloud'' takes a fair chunk of system memory due
    to the sheer number of entities - take for the castle example you used above,
    are you subsequently able to use these to create a full-fledged 3D model without
    the system becoming overly taxed?'

    AutoCAD''s point cloud implementation is pretty impressive. It can handle up to
    around 2 billion points and with very good performance (the indexing into the
    cloud means an appropriate subset is displayed). The whole cloud isn''t loaded,
    but you will need a certain amount of memory to hold AutoCAD''s point cloud object,
    of course.


    The modelling integration is pretty good, too: you can create geometry by snapping
    to points in the cloud, for instance. I expect more advanced capabilities to come
    over time, whether implemented by Autodesk or external developers.

    I haven''t actually loaded any files into photosynth (yet), but correct me if
    I''m wrong, it seems that photosynth is doing this virtual 3d scanning? You load
    a set of pictures into it, and it creates this point cloud from them.


    Is that right?'

    nice piece of work and fairly laborious ;)


    There are some points I noticed:

    <ol>

    <li>I wonder in which unit the point cloud is. The mighty tower of Pembroke Castle
    has a diameter of about 1.2, I hope this is not meters ;)</li>

    <li>Maybe this is also because of the scale (and limited precision), the point
    cloud looks somewhat "rasterized" (points arranged in a grid when looking from
    top), whereas the feature point cloud shouldn''t look like that by its nature.</li>

    <li>I''m also really interested in what precision could be accomplished using
    this technique. All the point clouds I have "photosynthed" yet are pretty noisy.
    But that''s a question to the Phothosynth guys I guess.</li>

    </ol>


    OK, enough criticism, I am looking forward to seeing this going further and meanwhile
    running my experiments trying to photosynth frames extracted from a video - and
    so missing the glorious Bayern victory over ManU a few minutes ago :)


    Best regards,

    Thanks! :-)


    1. The point cloud is in Photosynth''s internal units, which I haven''t attempted
    to map into anything like the real world. Photos are unitless - and the internal
    point ordinates are stored as single-precision floats - so Photosynth uses units
    that are appropriate for its need to collate images, which won''t reflect reality
    in any way.


    2. Yes, I''ve noticed the same. Presumably this is some function of a reduction
    in complexity or a by-product of their analysis algorithm.


    3. There does appear to be a fair amount of noise, although I tend to be a little
    forgiving considering how the clouds are being generated.


    Whether this particular approach proves useable for real-world design capture
    remains to be seen, but it certainly demonstrates what will one day be possible.

  body: "Greetings, Kean,\n\nIn the pointcloud files the first number notates which\
    \ pointcloud from the synth that binary file is a part of and the second number\
    \ notates which piece of that pointcloud it is.\n\nThe primary pointcloud is referred\
    \ to in the Photosynth log files and the pointcloud bin files as Synth 0, so every\
    \ bin file which corresponds to the pointcloud for synth 0 will begin \"points_0_\"\
    . In your example list above, the \"points_1_0.bin\" file corresponds to a second\
    \ pointcloud within the synth.\n\nGenerally speaking, you can accurately tell\
    \ how many pointclouds you can expect to harvest from a given synth by viewing\
    \ the synth in Grid Mode and counting the photo clusters, barring the last group\
    \ of orphan photos which consist of photos which did not correspond to any others\
    \ (hence no features matched and therefore no points). Occasionally a single photo\
    \ cluster may contain mini clusters which are not strongly connected to the rest\
    \ of the scene and have their own miniature pointcloud, but have enough of a connection\
    \ that they are still grouped together within the Photosynth viewer, though they\
    \ will be referred to in the log file and pointcloud files as separate.\n\nAs\
    \ to Tilo's question about how accurate the pointcloud can be, the answer is honestly\
    \ that it depends on what input you provide. The closer you get to a subject,\
    \ the more of its texture will appear in the pointcloud. The more crisp your shots\
    \ are, likewise. The greater number of angles you provide of a given surface,\
    \ the more finely detailed the reconstruction will become.\n\nTo highly define\
    \ surfaces for pointclouds, it is useful to think of using your photos as sculpting\
    \ tools. Think of taking photos in patterns that prove that your subject is not\
    \ some sort of visual trick, facade, or movie set, but the real thing. \n\nMove\
    \ all the way around things or think of using your camera to sweep, crawl, or\
    \ polish a surface.\n\nI have found that orbits are one of the most effective\
    \ and descriptive camera motions that can be universally applied to just about\
    \ any subject in order to maximally inform Photosynth about any given surfaces.\
    \ Use multiple orbits at multiple heights, distances, or orientations and the\
    \ accuracy multiplies.\n\nSimple pans left or right or strafing a subject in a\
    \ straight line can work, but actually leaves much about the scene ambiguous.\
    \ Orbits, by contrast, leave very little room for error in interpretation, however\
    \ applying orbits to many portions of a scene quickly drives your number of photos\
    \ up very highly.\n\nI tend to strive to quickly define each major object in a\
    \ scene with at least one orbit apiece, then add larger scale panoramas or strafes\
    \ that provide continuous coverage of entire walls full of objects at a wider\
    \ field of view to emphasize how each smaller piece fits into the whole. If I\
    \ still have more space in my photo budget then I add photos walking along the\
    \ natural pathways through a scene - both directions along each path, if possible,\
    \ although the pathways are largely for actually viewing the synth, rather than\
    \ for the benefit of the pointcloud.\n\nThe simple moral of the story is that\
    \ as you pay more attention to individual objects, rather than simply sweeping\
    \ past them with your camera, the more clearly they become seen within the pointcloud."

    I''m not sure whether this question falls within your area of expertise, but here
    goes, anyway...


    Are you aware of any programmatic way to determine the number and size of the
    various point clouds in a synth? Knowing this would present some really interesting
    optimization possibilities (particular in terms of downloading and processing
    the various files in parallel).

    I''ve just read your comment thanks to the link in Kean''s latest post.


    The orbit-around-object method you''ve suggested to take the photos is actually
    the one I''ve experimented with in <a href="http://photosynth.net/view.aspx?cid=18c0f3ef-15ca-4f53-badd-93944f6ed58b">http://photosynth.net/view.aspx?cid=18c0f3ef-15ca-4f53-badd-93944f6ed58b</a>


    Though it might not look too impressive, it is notable that I''ve created it taking
    two (1280x720) videos and uploading over 600 grabbed frames.


    I believe this could be an approach to easily take the massive amount of photos
    needed to create a relatively high density point cloud.'

    ultimately point clouds inside AutoCAD are currently used as references for modelling
