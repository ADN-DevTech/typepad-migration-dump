  body: 'Is there any chance we''ll ever see ObjectARX.net run on the Mac version
    of AutoCAD?


    I mean, with Mono it would be theoretically possible, but I''m not aware of Autodesk
    plans regarding this.


    The obvious advantage would be developing cross-platform plugins.


    Thanks!'

  body: "Hi Kean,\n\nTTIF goes functional! It occured to me that you are performing\
    \ a self join, unfortunately there's no direct equivalent of F#'s Seq.distinctBy\
    \ in Linq to make it triangular.\n\nAnyway, what I ended up with as F# implementation\
    \ for CG is this:\n<pre>    let allPairs f =\n        Seq.unfold\n           \
    \ (function\n                | [] -> None\n                | x::xs -> Some(Seq.map\
    \ (f x) xs, xs) )\n        >> Seq.concat\n    \n    let lns = allPairs (fun x\
    \ y -> new Line(x, y)) pts</pre>\nwhich demonstrates at least function composition\
    \ and partial application, if nothing else.\n\nMany thanks for your blog."
