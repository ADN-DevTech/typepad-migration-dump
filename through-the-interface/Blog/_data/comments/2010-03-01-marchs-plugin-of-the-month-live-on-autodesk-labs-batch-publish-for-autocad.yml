  body: 'Hi Kean,


    This seems to be a nice tool. I have two questions:


    1) Is the application backwards compatible, or it works only for 2010 ?


    2) Is there any option which would allow to create a multi-pages PDF document,
    like let''s say if a DWG has 3 layouts than maybe I would want to have a PDF with
    three pages ? Or even more than one DWG in the same PDF document, maybe for drawings
    related somehow ?


    Thanks for taking you time to answer this,


    Constantin

  body: 'Hi Constantin,


    1) The application should work from AutoCAD 2007 onwards. Be sure to let us know
    if you find any issues, of course.


    2) I''m guessing this is possible, although it would require some code changes
    (the good news being the code is all there for you to extend :-). I''ll pass this
    on as a possible enhancement for the next release.

    P.S. Sorry - which Preview do you mean?'

    The Preview I was talking about is the one here, before posting the comments.


    But it seems that today it works :)

    Some time ago I wrote my own batch plot routine. This one has some very nice features.
    I will definitely give it a spin.


    Probably I''ll drop my own routine and switch to yours.

  body: 'Both mechanisms use DSD files to drive PUBLISH, from what I understand.


    This plugin provides a 1-to-1 mapping between a DWG (or DXF) and a DWF and/or
    PDF. It''s relatively inflexible, in that sense, but if that''s what you want
    then you can just point it at a folder and it cranks away.


    If you need more flexibility, such as combining sheets from multiple DWGs into
    a single output file, then you would probably see the benefit of investing time
    in setting up sheet sets for your drawings.


    I''m admittedly no sheet-set expert, so if anyone wants to chime in with more
    information, please do so.

    \ to the user would be nice. Like changing the cursor to the hourglass or a message\
    \ in a label\n\n2) Possibility to reload a configuration. The PublishInfo.xml\
    \ is reanamed to PublishInfo_old.xml. When the same direcotry is published again\
    \ this file is deleted and the configuration must be done all over again. Would\
    \ be nice if the old config is reloaded automatically or could be loaded mannualy.\n\
    \n3) Add a option to ignor Modelspace. Saves time during configuration.\n\n\n\
    Overall I like the tool. \n\nRegards,\n\nStephan"

  body: 'Hi Sandeep,


    A couple of options...


    You could modify the code to support 3D DWF: of I recall correctly we just drive
    PUBLISH programmatically using a DSD file, so it should be easy enough to add
    that option.


    You might look at ScriptPro 2.0, to see whether it can be used to script the creation
    of 3D DWF files (although I believe the 3DDWF command is dialog-only, unfortunately).

    Unfortunately I don''t have any suggestions, as there''s a lot that I don''t know
