  body: I've seen this as well. Sometimes it works to right click and select properties
    on the DLL and unblock it. But sometimes not and in these cases AlternateStreamView
    <a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/alternate_data_streams.html">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/alternate_data_streams.html</a>
    has worked to use by deleting all streams marked ":Zone.Identifier:$DATA" for
    the selected files to get rid of the security blocks.

    I have used same method but seems like I got better results if the file was zipped
    by right clicking on zip file and selecting unblock before I unzipped it.'

  body: I have tried this and I am still not able to run a .dll file from the company
    network. Are there potentially spots I can look to make sure network security
    is not interfering? I have a feeling it is the case, but I hardly know a nut from
    a bolt when it comes to talking about servers. What should I do?

    But we are working on making .NET easier to work with, at lease with respect to
    AutoCAD.

    \ came up again on the .NET discussion group\n<a href=\"http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/NET/dll-on-the-network-will-that-be-a-problem/m-p/3435819#M28541\"\

    \nI was not aware that setting enabling LoadFromRemoteSources was allowing AutoCAD\
    \ to load assemblies from anywhere, regardless of the CAS policy in effect.  I\
    \ found this:\n\nNetFx40_LegacySecurityPolicy enabled=\"true\"\n(The comment format\
    \ removed the xml, so here is an MSDN link, <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd409253.aspx)\"\
    >http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd409253.aspx)</a>\n\nwhich when used\
    \ instead of (not along with) LoadFromRemoteSources causes the CAS policy to be\
    \ obeyed, and I am able to load from a network share if the CAS policy allows\
    \ it.  There was a little back and forth on the discussion thread I linked, and\
    \ another link to an MSDN site warning about a potential problem with Native assemblies\
    \ not in the GAC.  Maybe this is worth another post from you to get it out to\
    \ the masses."

  body: 'Hi Dave,


    I''m far from being an authority on CAS policies, but hopefully your comment gives
    people what they need, assuming they want to use them rather than opening AutoCAD
    to loading any network-resident assembly (which could clearly pose a security
    risk).


    But perhaps this is indeed worth a post, at some point...


    Thanks!

    This worked for me to, but why is this not default?

    If you add it, without using netload, it will do no harm.'

  body: 'I suspect the decision not to have it in there by default in acad.exe.config
    is probably security-related (loading from network locations is a common way that
    viruses spread, albeit not usually with .NET, right now).


    Of course people can choose to enable it, but it''s not something we''ve chosen
    to do for everyone.
