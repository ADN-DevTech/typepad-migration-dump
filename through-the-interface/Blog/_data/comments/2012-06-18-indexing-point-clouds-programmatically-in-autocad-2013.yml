  body: "Hi Kean,\n\nI really appreciate the effort on answering my comment. I sort\
    \ of did the same thing after some research. \n\nNow I am curious on how to use\
    \ that point cloud, as simple as say coloring them based on my user defined criteria.\
    \ I am trying to read them as databaseservices.pointcloud but in vain. If you\
    \ have some pointers or urls, please let me know. Thanks."

    control, you should be able to do at least a bit more via C++ (if that''s an option
    for you).

  body: 'RS,


    If you''re an ADN member, I suggest searching there for samples (search for "ObjectARX"
    and "point cloud").


    You might also ask the team directly, whether via the ADN site or the ObjectARX
    Discussion Group (which the ADN team monitors).


    Regards,

    groups. I''d suggest at the most crude level just writing to a text file and reading
    it from your AutoCAD-based app.

  body: I am interested in best practice on a specific workflow.  This workflow was
    facilitated by the "Feature Extraction" Lab tool which was discontinued for Revit,
    but will hopefully show up in 2014. A user loads a point cloud file from an existing
    building into Navisworks, performs the measure command to grab points along a
    pipe run, then copies the the X,Y,Z spatial coordinates from the Measure tool
    out to a .txt file.  The user then loads the .txt file into ACAD to locate these
    points and subsequently model the pipe run via CADWorx.  The existing workflow
    works, but with thousands of points, it is inefficient. Any suggestions on Feature
    Extraction for ACAD, and/or Revit for that matter?  Appreciate your assistance.
