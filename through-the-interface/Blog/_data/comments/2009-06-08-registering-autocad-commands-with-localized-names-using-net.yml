    nice post, I had another doubt, I am able to obtain the object id''s for each
    entity in a dwg file, do you know how i can obtain other data like: area, name
    etc using that, should i refer to an extension dictionary(using c#)?

    thanks'

    If I have a dialog box that has text on it, would I then have to add that text
    into each of the localized resources for the language? Then somehow reference
    that text?


    Also, if my dialog box populates combo boxes and lists from the current ACAD drawing
    file, I can assume that based on the users current language, those items will
    populate accordingly - correct?


    Thanks in advance.

  body: 'Hi Steve,


    That''s correct: you can certainly store strings for dialog boxes in resources
    in the same way (you should be able to find some info on the web about it - it''s
    a common technique).


    Most of the DWG file is actually global, but things like symbol table names (blocks,
    layers, linetypes) will very often be in the local language.


    I hope this helps,
