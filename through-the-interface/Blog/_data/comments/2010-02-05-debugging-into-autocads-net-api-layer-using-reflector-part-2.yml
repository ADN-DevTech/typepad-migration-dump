    I don''t know whether that would help.

  body: 'Something to try...


    You might modify your WinForms app to look for a running instance of AutoCAD (just
    for when you''re debugging) rather than launching a new one. That way you can
    host the C# DLL project in VS and launch AutoCAD to debug it, and the WinForms
    app can then pick up the instance that''s being debugged.
