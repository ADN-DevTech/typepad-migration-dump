  body: 'If only I had enough pics of it (from enough angles) to get a decent model.
    It was a brief visit, sadly.


    I am going to try to get one of El Quseir fort, where I think I may have taken
    enough shots to do it justice...

  body: 'I was about to ask the same question.

    I''ve tried photofly on a few office items (like model cars and toys on people''s
    shelves) with below average results, seems you must practice a bit on it.  I really
    want to put a camera on an RC helicopter and try to get a 3d model of site grading
    for certain projects.  When will mobil laser scanning be out??'

    options available, whether via consumer-priced laser scanners, depth cameras,
    photogrammetry or whatever else comes next. :-)
