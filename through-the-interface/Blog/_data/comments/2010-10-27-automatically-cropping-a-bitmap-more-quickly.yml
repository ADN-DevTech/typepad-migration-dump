  body: 'Hi Kean - I like the changes you''ve made with this version. Although the
    copyclip speed has increased, it''s not as significant for me (being that your
    previous version didn''t slow me down any). However, the ability to copyclip block
    entities, and the "invalid" check are really great enhancements. Now for a new
    opportunity (I didn''t want to say problem). I’ve noticed that the clipboard manager
    doesn''t really like it when I copyclip text or mtext entities. And what I mean
    is the actual internal alpha/numeric text components when "editing" text or mtext.
    When any such item is copied the following happens:  (1) No component is registered
    in the clipboard (2) The previously highlighted clipboard entity preview image
    remains visible, regardless of which clipboard entity is selected for potential
    use. This situation remains until an entity is actually pasted into the drawing
    (and I click a couple times in the clipboard manager). Please help clarify if
    this is currently normal behavior, or just me. If you have any questions or need
    any other information, feel free to send me an email. Thanks for the new post.'

  body: 'Yes, even for me the speed increase was less pronounced when I looked at
    it again. I think I may have been working with 16-bit colour depth and the switch
    to 32-bit. But it was still slightly quicker, even with 32-bit colour.


    We deliberately excluded partial [M]Text fragments, <a href="http://labs.blogs.com/its_alive_in_the_lab/2010/02/updated-clipboard-manager-for-autocad-adn-plugin-of-the-month-now-available.html">right
    from v1.0.2</a>, as it created some strange issues with the palette.


    It seems there are now some issues with preview - I''ll take a look into that.

  body: 'Whenever I have a different icon from the selections ClipboarManager to insert
    it will insert the symbol not the same but I must return again to confirm the

    Immer wenn ich ein anders Symbol vom ClipboarManager auswähle um es einzufügen
    wird das symbol nicht gleich eingefügt sonder ich muss nochmal mit return bestätigen
    um das symbol einzufügen.'
