    I use CopySourceAsHtml, as mentioned in <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2011/03/finally-working-with-visual-studio-2010.html">today''s
    post</a>.


    Let me know if you can''t work out the settings I''ve used from the HTML source
    and I''ll send you details.


    Regards,
