  body: Since this is a recent post CMLContentSearchPreviews must be included in a
    newer API than what is delivered with AutoCAD 2012.  I am using AutoCAD 2012 and
    it is not available in the AutoCAD.Windows.Data namespace.

  body: 'Not that I''m aware of (off the top of my head). I had a quick look at the
    IL in acmgd.dll, but found it used a function called getBlockTableRecordThumbnail()
    that doesn''t appear to be in the public API).


    You might try posting to ADN or the discussion groups, to see if anyone has something
    more to share.
