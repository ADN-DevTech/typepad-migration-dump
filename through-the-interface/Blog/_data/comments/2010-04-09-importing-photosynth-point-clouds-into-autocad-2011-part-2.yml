  body: 'Hi Kean,


    I''ve tried everything you mention above to get this working, I''ve registered
    the ComUtilities file, and the ADN Plugin seems to Netload with no problems. I
    can browse the photosynth site, but no photosynths appear. (It seems to me that
    Silverlight isn''t starting up) Any ideas?


    FYI I''m running Windows 7 64-bit 4Gb Memory, with the UAC turned on - should
    that matter?


    Thanks in advance,


    Alex.'

  body: 'Hi Alex,


    When you say no Photosynths appear, do you mean in the left-hand, embedded browsing
    window or the right-hand history list? If the latter, it may be that the HTTP
    event is not being fired correctly on 64-bit systems (I will see if I can find
    a system to test this from my side).


    If you could <a href="mailto:kean.walmsley@autodesk.com?subject=ImportPhotosynth
    on 64-bit">email me a screenshot</a>, it might help me to understand the problem.


    It would also be interesting to know whether running the EXE directly (outside
    of AutoCAD) changes anything...


    It may be that UAC matters - maybe you could also try disabling that?


    Regards,

    it worked for me (which I actually found quite surprising, in a good way :-).


    Hopefully there''s a useful suggestion I can make based on your screenshot - we''ll
    see.

  body: 'Good Morning Kean,


    I get no Photosynth displayed in the left-hand window - whether I run the process
    from within AutoCAD or not. EDIT: I just ran the application outside of AutoCAD
    on my work machine (Windows 7 64-bit with UAC enabled) and it runs just fine -
    I guess I will have to try again at home later.


    Thanks,


    Alex.'

    Very interesting !

    I found a Point Cloud Extracter with different output formats.

    Maybe something for your project ?

    Great!


    That''s correct (as far as I''m aware). An early version of the tool created DBPoints
    instead of writing to a TXT->LAS->PCG, so that''s certainly still viable (although
    I doubt you want that many points stored separately in a DWG, even on a 64-bit
    system).


    You can snap to points for modelling in the base AutoCAD product, but that''s
    about it, for now. Civil 3D does more (in terms of applying surfaces), but I don''t
    know much about its specific capabilities.


    Between Autodesk and 3rd party efforts the landscape is likely to evolve quickly,
    I''m guessing.


    Cheers,
