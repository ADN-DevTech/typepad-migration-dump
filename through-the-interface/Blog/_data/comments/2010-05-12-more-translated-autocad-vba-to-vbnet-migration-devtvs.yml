  body: "just a comment about the convert tool.\n\nIt seems that the ToggleButton\
    \ is also recognized as a CheckButton. \nI was trying to convert a form which\
    \ contain ToggleButtons and it was giving me an error because it was being recognized\
    \ as a CheckButton.\n\nI changed the if statement in the ProcessControl Subroutine\
    \ to check first for ToggleButton. \n\nThis fix the problem."
