  body: 'Hello Kean,


    Very interesting article, what it highlights to me though is AutoCADs weakness
    in representing complex geometric features.  The solution as presented approximates
    the spiral using a polyline, and as such the accuracy of the object and it''s
    ability amongst other things to project and receive normals is limited.


    As a Civil designer you constantly use a wide range of geometry including parabolas,
    clothoid and bloss spirals and many others, none of these can be represented by
    AutoCAD!  And to make matters worse most of these have been available in Microstation
    for some time.


    What would be good is for some pressure to be applied to Autodesk to update their
    geometric engines capabilities to include these more complicated primitives.

  body: 'Hi Martin,


    The point of this post was simply to demonstrate the use of certain Functional
    Programming techniques within AutoCAD: not to implement a serious geometric object
    for real-world use.


    I can''t comment on the needs of Civil designers, as it''s not my domain, but
    I would expect AutoCAD''s Helix entity (which is a 3D spiral derived from Spline)
    to help, to some degree. And then there''s all the Civil-specific functionality
    implemented in AutoCAD Civil 3D (which is a more appropriate platform for Civil
    designers & engineers). I don''t know about the specific geometric types you''ve
    listed, but that''s the place I''d expect to look for it, rather than base AutoCAD.


    Regards,

  body: 'Just today I learned about the Fibonacci spiral, and I found your blog as
    a result of doing a Google search for FS images.  I was intrigued when I saw yours,
    as it was a perfect example of "feathers" used in the quilting world. I design
    and digitize (using AutoDesk AutoSketch) patterns for quilting machines that run
    similar to a CNC. Many of my patterns are feathers, and without even knowing about
    the FB, I have been using a loose freehand version (if there can be such a thing)
    of it for many years. It just goes to show what a naturally appealing shape this
    creates.  By the way, if this design was a continuous line from start to finish
    (with necessary backtracking), and exported as an AutoCAD R12/L2 DXF it would
    run beautifully on a computerized quilting machine. Yes, I know that is an old
    format. Original systems were sent out with AS8 to the consumers so that has remained
    the standard format.


    If you are even the least bit interested, you can see a photo of my freehand quilting
    of feathers in my May 7, 2009 post on my wordpress blog. You can also see some
    of my digitized designs by clicking on the link under digitized designs on my
    blog.


    Thank you again for the great information here on your blog.


    Regards,

    Yes, R12 DXF is still used for a lot of CNC-like systems.


    All the best,
