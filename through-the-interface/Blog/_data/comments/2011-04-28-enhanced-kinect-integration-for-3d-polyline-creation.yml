  body: very helpful video kean, thanks a bunch for your effort on that.  Maybe you
    can set up that death star in front of the camera, then use your hands to fly
    a spaceship or two around it and record in 3D.  Green screen not needed, as you
    would then replay the flight with just the death star in the camera.  Somehow
    combine the input of the camera, with pre-recorded stuff going on.  You could
    clone yourself that way if you wanted.  Or fight yourself to the death, but we
    know who wins...

  body: 'I think someone is indeed working on that problem (a company wanting to provide
    a generic 3D controller - can''t remember their name).


    I''m currently not even working on Kinect with AutoCAD, as I''m working inside
    Windoes 7 on Parallels and the MS Kinect SDK doesn''t like that. Hopefulyl they''ll
    fix it in time for me to prepare for my AU2011 class on "Integrating Kinect with
    AutoCAD". :-S :-)

  body: 'Hi Masssimo,


    At some point this kind of thing will become straightforward (I''m betting), but
    right now it''s a little tricky - lots of moving parts to deal with.


    You should check out Photofly, by the way - which is intended for this kind of
    precision-oriented activity.


    This video is likely to get your interest, in particular:
