    That''s certainly one option - you might also just save to a text (XML for more

  body: 'Hey Kean,

    Sorry to drag up an old post, but I had a question about some of the methodology
    used to access the AutoCAD application.  I see that a batch file is being written
    on the fly and run beforehand to get the proper object type and handle.  However
    then a new process is created and pointed to the batch file.  Wouldn''t pointing
    the created Process to the exe path skip needing to create the batch file altogether?


    '' Create the AutoCad Process

    Dim acadExe As New Process()


    '' Populate AutoCAD process starting details

    acadExe.StartInfo.FileName = acadExePath

    acadExe.StartInfo.Arguments = "/nologo /b " & tmpExitScript

    acadExe.StartInfo.WindowStyle = ProcessWindowStyle.Hidden

    acadExe.Start()


    The above works for me, but I don''t want to go this route if using a batch file
    is more stable or has benefits I''m not seeing.'

  body: 'Hi Kean,


    I am running a custom .NET dll command through ScriptPro 2.0 and it works well.
    However my command includes a few calls to SendStringToExecute(), and it appears
    that these calls are completely ignored.


    I tried SendCommand() and acedCmd() but these didn''t work either, so this doesn''t
    seem to be a synchronicity issue.


    I haven''t tested it, but perhaps this is a limitation for script files in general
    rather than a ScriptPro specific problem. Any ideas what''s happening with this?


    Regards, Art


    p.s. No idea if "synchronicity" is a real word, but I''m sticking to it :-)'

  body: 'Hi Art,


    Hmm - good question: can you script commands inside AutoCAD that call other commands
    via SendStringToExecute()? I''ve never tried it (that I can recall, anyway).


    You might have more luck forcing "syncronicity" if you declare the commands as
    "session", but otherwise you might try pinging ADN or the AutoCAD .NET Discussion
    Group, to see what ideas you can get from them.


    Cheers,

  body: 'Quick Update:


    I tested my script file using the SCRIPT command and both SendStringToExecute()
    and SendCommand() failed. So it appears this is an AutoCAD scripting issue.


    Good news is that acedCmd() is executed from a script file, and hence will work
    with ScriptPro.


    I now have options, I can use acedCmd(), and I can also enter strings into the
    script file itself. With this I can get something to work for me, which is great
    because I think ScriptPro is a sweet piece of kit.


    Thanks, Art'

    First of all, this block is really great.


    I am searching for the ScriptPro tool 32-bit / 64-bit.

    Autodesk has changed the Support site´s, so all the links are broken.

    Would you please so kind and give the community the correct link ?'
