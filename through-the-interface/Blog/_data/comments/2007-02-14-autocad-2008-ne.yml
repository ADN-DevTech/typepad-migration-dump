    My understanding is that as a subscription customer you will receive the new products
    as soon as they become available. Right now they are planned to ship in the spring
    (the specific date may vary depending on the country/language version).

    Please have a look into this URL (http://www.visualcadd.com/v5interface.gif);
    this image will explain our product requirement. We have the existing

    application will all the functionality with FoxPro as database access and user
    interface. Now we are going to enhance the application using AutoCAD (instead

    FoxPro).


    For this we are doing the feasible study, what is needed from AutoCAD to integrate
    the same? And we don''t want to do any comprise that AutoCAD functionalities will
    be integrated with in

    our .NET desktop product. For this we need the perfect solution which one need
