  body: 'Hi Kean,


    Thank you for all of the posts you provide!  I utilize your blog in my AutoCAD
    .Net research and I follow it closely for the new posts.  It is a very helpful
    blog for me.


    Can I ask though that your provide code in a more downloadable form?  Maybe others
    have suggestions on how they cut and paste the code you provide but I always find
    it time consuming to eliminate extra line returns and difficult to convert VB.Net
    to C#.


    I cut and pasted the code above in this post to the <a href="http://www.developerfusion.com/tools/convert/vb-to-csharp/">http://www.developerfusion.com/tools/convert/vb-to-csharp/</a>
    site and it keeps failing.  This is not the first time I''ve copied the code from
    a post and had issues so I thought I would make my request.


    Thanks!

    Doug'

  body: 'Hi Doug,


    A good question - one I''ve been meaning to address for some time. I''ll try to
    do so in a post sometime soon.


    One trick: Google Chrome copies/pastes the code without the additional linebreaks.
    Otherwise I''m looking into Clipboard manipulation tools to allow the superfluous
    linefeeds to be stripped (we''ll see what''s possible).


    On the subject of code conversion... unfortunately I only have so much time to
    develop code for posts, and making sure it translates cleanly via online tools
    is a secondary (and therefore often ignored) priority. Hopefully the linefeed
    trick will help, at least.


    Regards,


    Kean'

    I''ve found that ReSharper formats the pasted code quite nicely .... removes newlines,
    whitespace etc, etc.



    Thanks for the resource Kean.

    I''m certainly going to post on this topic, and hopefully other useful suggestions
    will come out of the woodwork. :-)
