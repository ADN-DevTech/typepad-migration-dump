    I even saw it in the ObjectBrowser when I searched on "reverse", but discarded
    it mentally ("surely it can''t be that easy?"). Ah well, the roll continues.


    Thanks, Mark - I''ll update the post.

  body: 'Be careful when trying to use the ReverseCurve method on the "complex" entities.
    It doesn''t work with non-database-resident entities (i.e. those not placed in
    the drawing).

    I tested only Polyline3d, but I suppose Polyline 2d works the same.'

    This example is safe enough, then, but it''s good to be aware of the method''s
    limitations.

    On the one hand I''d like to thank you for pointing the issue out, but on the
    other hand I admit to finding it a little petty that you''d choose to do so in
    such vague terms.


    And it''s vice versa, by the way.

    What kind of polylines do you care about? I''m on vacation, this week, but could
    take a look next week, in case.

    Anyway, the solution is to calculate area from coordinates(Shoelace formula) and
    if it''s positive then you have a counterclockwise and vice-versa(I suppose this
    is the word of the post)
