    You mention iterating through the contents of the IDmap.

    I''d like to check the contents of the idMap when cloning to see what objectID''s
    it contains and if they should be cloned.


    idMap.Item(Key as objectID)

    idMap.Contains(Key as objectID)


    Both ask for the objectIDs which is what I want to check for.'

  body: Sorry..I did try the idmap.Contains(ojbID) but it didn't seem to accept that
    it contained an objectID when it should have. I can't access the contents of the
    idmap to find out why.

    From what I recall you can iterate through an idMap using this approach:


    foreach (KeyValuePair kvp in idMap)

    {

    ...

    }
