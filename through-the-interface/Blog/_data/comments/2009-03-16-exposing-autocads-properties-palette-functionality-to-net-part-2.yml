  body: 'Hi CSharpbird,


    Oh wow - my sincere apologies... there was a mistake in the code both in the last
    post and the current post.


    I''ve now fixed the code in both posts as well as the <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/files/opm.net.zip">project
    for download</a> (please do try it again).


    In case people want to apply the "fix" themselves: the second parameter of SetCurrentValueData()
    was being incorrectly marshaled. To address this I made the following edits to
    the project:


    - On line 106 of IDynamicProperty2.h I changed "interior_ptr&lt;Object^&gt; varData"
    to "Object^ varData". This was probably copy & pasted at some point from GetCurrentValueData().


    - On line 107 of customPropertySample.cs I removed the "ref" keyword from the
    second parameter of the function signature.


    Now it should work correctly. Both Cyrille and I send our apologies on this one
    - one of us should have picked it up before posting. :-(

    If you open a "Visual Studio Command Prompt" (usually this is in the program group

    After three weeks out of the Autocad programming... I''ve been involved in some

    they are static as the example you gave. How can I work with the objects?


    Another question is if it''s possible to create categories in order not to have

    a particular object (I hope I have that right).

  body: 'Ah ha! So - after talking to ADN and seeing that Kean''s code does actually
    work in 64bit, I had to look at what i was actually doing with the properties
    to find my issue.


    Specifically IsPropertyEnabled was failing and I was doing the following:


    public void IsPropertyEnabled(object pUnk, out int bEnabled)

    {

    AcadObject obj = pUnk as AcadObject;

    int id = obj.ObjectID); // Fail here.

    ...

    }


    If I do this instead then it works:


    public void IsPropertyEnabled(object pUnk, out int bEnabled)

    {

    AcadObject obj = pUnk as AcadObject;

    string handle = obj.Handle; // works.

    ...

    }


    (note either will work on 32bit)


    Not sure why the ObjectId property doesn''t work on 64bit but oh well - it''s
    easy enough to use a handle instead.


    Hopefully the above will save someone some time and frustration.


    Cheers,

    Chris'

    Can a property be added to the properties palette when there are no entities selected?
    In my instance, I would like to a combo box, with populated data.


    This blog has been a fantastic source of information!!


    Thanks

    Yes - this is a common problem migrating between 32- and 64-bit systems: you have
    to use Handle or ObjectId32 instead of ObjectId when using the COM interface,
    I believe.

    I recall there is a mode you can use - although I don''t remember whether it''s
    exposed via .NET - for adding such properties during command execution (I''m not
    sure about when no commands are active).


    I suggest either pinging ADN or posting on the AutoCAD .NET (or perhaps ObjectARX)
    discussion group.

    I used the following contstruct to get the relevant property manager:

    IPropertyManager2* pManager = (IPropertyManager2*)GET_OPMEXTENSION_CREATE_PROTOCOL()->CreateOPMObjectProtocol(NULL,
    2)->GetPropertyManager();


    Then use the resulting property manager to attach properties to "No selection"
    state.'

    As I didn''t implement this originally, I''m not really the one to be able to

    A lot depends on whether you want to implement a specific "export" routine that
    extracts the data and uploads it to your web-service, in some way, or if you want
    to host RealDWG on the server itself.


    But again - not a question that''s related to this topic, in any way.

    I know your comment is older than a year now but i''m currently trying to use
    asdkOPMNetExt.dll on a 64bit machine and i fail constantly. My proplem is that
    i''m not able to cast the com object as an AcadObject. It works fine in a 32bit
    environment but on 64bit i get an "Unable to cast..." Exception.

    That error occurs inside the functions GetCurrentValueData and SetCurrentValueData.
    I also tried to receive some Informations about the Com Object with Microsoft.VisualBasic.Information.TypeName(pVarData)
    but that returns just "Nothing". Also i can''t even use the GetType() function
    on the Com Object. It also throws an Exception "Object reference not set to an
    instance of an object.mscorlib". Do you or anyone else have an idea what the problem
    could be.

    I''m using AutoCAD 2011 64bit by the way.'

    I would expect you''d be able to use instances rather than having to derive a
    new class for each property. But I don''t recall whether I''ve actually done so,
    or not, so I suggest giving it a try.
