    I''m afraid there isn''t anything beyond what''s in these blog entries... you
    might otherwise try posting to the AutoCAD .NET Discussion Group (at http://discussion.autodesk.com/forum.jspa?forumID=152).

  body: 'Arun - You do not have to extract the template from the zip file in order
    to get it to work. In fact, for it to appear when put into the normal template
    directory, you must leave it as a zip file.


    By putting it in its extracted form in the folder that you have placed it, it
    appears as part of the standard templates and not as a user template. This could
    get overwritten or deleted in a future update.


    Try this. Create a new standard project. Export it to a template and have VS add
    it into your available templates at the same time with the option that it gives
    you. Check to see where the zip file has been placed - that´s where you need to
    place this template zip file as well.'

    Sorry - these templates have been provided "as is", and I don''t know what needs
    changing for them to work for VS 2008.


    Ultimately the structure of a .NET module for AutoCAD is really simple: create
    a standard Class Module and add in references to acmgd.dll and acdbmgd.dll, then
    copy & paste code from nearly any of my posts. That''s all there is to it.

  body: 'Mr. Kean,


    I have a problem, in VS 2005 C#, on declaring a variable that references a type
    that belongs in acmgd.dll and acdbmgd.dll.


    For example, just a simple declaration like: Document doc = Autodesk.AutoCAD.ApplicationServices.Application.DocumentManager.MdiActiveDocument;


    Although, there is no compilation error, at runtime, when it tries to get into
    the function it gives me an exception "The type initializer for ''<Module>'' threw
    an exception.". At the InnerException info it says "The C++ module failed to load
    during process initialization.\n" on "msvcm80" as Source.


    Do you have an idea about that situation?'

    You will need an in-process module (which you can launch and drive via COM, an
    AutoCAD API which does work across process boundaries).
