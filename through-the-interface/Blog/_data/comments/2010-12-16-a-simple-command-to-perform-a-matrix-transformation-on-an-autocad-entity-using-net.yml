    It also has samples to move, rotate, mirror, and scale objects using transformation
    with TransformBy.'

    The next post will actually present a UI to generate and apply matrices like the
    ones you''ve described.


    Cheers,

    Nice article.


    Just to clarify, the use of a 4x4 matrix using homogeneous coodinates it''s just
    for make the composition of (affine) transformation a matrix multiplication operation,
    by other hand, all transformation can be achieved using a 3x3 (or 2x2 in 2D)matrix,
    but the composition won''t be, in all the cases, a matrix multiplication operation.
    You can also use quaternions to representate transformations, and there are very
    hot discussions about which way is better.'

    I''ve used matrix calculations for many years without ever using the words homogeneous
    and affine (at least not in that context), so I avoided copying them from Wikipedia
    into this particular article. ;-)


    But you''re basically saying that having a 4x4 matrix allows the composition of
    transformations via multiplication? That''s helpful for people to know (and it''s
    certainly something that will be demonstrated practically in the next article).


    I do believe that translation (or displacement, in AutoCAD-speak) needs a 4x4
    matrix - I''d be curious to know how that could be achieved using a 3x3 matrix.


    AutoCAD doesn''t use quaternions (although I think some of our other products
    might), so I''m going to stick with matrices for the purposes of this series of
    articles.

    You are right, translation can''t be done by 3x3 matrix multiplication. it''s
    just a vector adding operation.'

    This is a bit off-topic: in future, please post such questions to ADN or to the
    appropriate discussion group.


    What you want to achieve is altogether possible, given enough effort. You''ll
    need to do some programmatic selection based on location (Editor.SelectCrossingWindow()
    should help) and then perform some intersections (Entity.IntersectWith()).
