    Did you forget to point out the German version of the guide (<a href="http://download.autodesk.com/media/adn/DevTV_VBA_Migration/german/DevTV_VBA_To_VBdotNet_Migration_German.html)">http://download.autodesk.com/media/adn/DevTV_VBA_Migration/german/DevTV_VBA_To_VBdotNet_Migration_German.html)</a>
    or is there a reason why you did not link to it by now? Or did I overlook it,
    although I actually have a rss-subscription to your blog.

    (I did not check for the Spanish version.)

    Kind regards, Stephan'

  body: 'Hi Kean,

    I understand that it was not ready at the time of this post, but since it looked
    quite ready yesterday and somebody must have put in online (you obviously just
    took it offline again) I just was wondering. But as long as you did not forget
    about it I am all happy ;) and looking foreward to it.

    Kind regards, Stephan'

    I have neither looked at the content online nor removed it, so I have no idea
    what''s going on with the link.


    Once someone in my team notifies me that both Spanish and German versions are
    available, I''ll be announcing them in a blog post.


    Regards,


    Kean'

  body: Hi Kean, me again... I've downloaded the DevTV Video and found the answer
    inside the downloaded zip. Originally thought, that the zip is only the video.
    Best, Martin
