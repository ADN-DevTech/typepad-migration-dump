    I just added a picture of the mammoth Tres Yonis synth inside AutoCAD (silly of
    me to forget).

    into compiling your code, do you by any chance have executable on that for download?


    Any response is appreciated.'

  body: "Hello, my name is Luca and I am following a University project that includes\
    \ the measurement with laser scanner. Currently I got a refund dimensional element\
    \ through the appropriate programs supplied by manufacturers of equipment, but\
    \ I would compare the point cloud with the system developed by Microsoft Photosynth,\
    \ using insight3d that it is open, and using Bundler PMVS2 made by Dr.. Furukawa.\n\
    I tried SynthExport-1.1.0, but I can not get a point cloud formats compatible\
    \ with AutoCAD 2011, and displays them in MeshLab, but points are coarse and sparse.\n\
    I saw your work using VS2008, but I do not understand anything about programming\
    \ and I really do not know how to apply your program provided in version 3. How\
    \ do I apply for the cloud of points that I see on the website of PhotoSynth directly\
    \ in Autocad? When I start the browser in the folder appear Photosynth errors\
    \ and the program window is completely black with no buttons or other controls.\n\
    Waiting to hear from you. Greetings. Luca\n - Italy - Università degli Studi di\

  body: 'Hello Luca,


    This tool isn''t yet packaged in a way that''s easy for non-programmers to get
    working, I''m afraid. You need to register a DLL (the steps are described somewhere
    in a previous post, but I forget which).
