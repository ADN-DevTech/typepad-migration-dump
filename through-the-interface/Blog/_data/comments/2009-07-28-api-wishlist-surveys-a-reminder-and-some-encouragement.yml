    That are great news about the .NET Developer’s Guide. One question though: Will
    it be in English only or in other languages as well (i.e. German)?

    Kind regards, Stephan'

    both C# and VB.NET source code, which is clearly a very valuable feature, but
    I don''t know of plans to translate the text.

    What would be the simplest way to create an associative dimension programmatically?
    We have a project on .NET, so going for ObjectArx for this one thing only does
    not sound very attractive.


    I have found one sample of the AssocNetwork (<a href="http://forums.autodesk.com/autodesk/attachments/autodesk/152/24647/1/Parametric%20VB%20Net%20Code.txt)">http://forums.autodesk.com/autodesk/attachments/autodesk/152/24647/1/Parametric%20VB%20Net%20Code.txt)</a>
    and managed to create parameter _driven_ geometry programmatically, but can''t
    figure out how to just simply create a simple associative dimension without the
    dependency on a parameter with the AssocNetwork.


    The task would be to insert two blocks and add an associative dimension between
    them programmatically.


    Inserting blocks is easy, but can''t find a simple solution for creating an associative
    dimension between entitites programmatically.'

    Happy New Year! It was nice to see you at the UK DevDay.


    You may want to submit this question via ADN, but one suggestion would be to see
    whether you can simply run the command rather that calling down into C++ (assuming
    there isn''t a .NET API - I honestly can''t recall whether it was .NET or C++,
    at this stage).


    All the best for 2012,

  body: 'Thanks. Went into AdnAssocContraintAPI C++ code and out of nowhere got this
    idea how to set the dimension as a ''reference only'' by deactivating it. This
    one line addition works also on the previous .NET code :-D


    Wish you all the best for 2012 as well and thanks for keeping up this marvellous
    blog, it has been very helpful on several occasions!
