    At this stage I would think that leveraging standard tools working with point
    clouds in our products might be the way for you to go. Have you looked at these,
    at all?

    How do you get the PolyFaceMesh colored (or shaded) in you 3D view. Is that a
    property to set to the PolyFaceMesh.


    Thanks

    I''m pretty sure that''s just due to setting the Visual Style to Conceptual.


    If you''re interested in per-face colouring, I did this once in F#:

    Hopefully this will give you some clues as to how to move forward.

  body: 'Hi Mourad,


    Not exactly (unless you create a point cloud, in much the same way as the series
    of posts on Kinect integration shows).


    You could probably create a texture (by stretching the planar polygons to drape
    properly across the 3D mesh faces), but it sounds pretty tricky.


    Do let me know if you have any success with either of these approaches,

    It should be straightforward enough. There''s some code in this post that deals
    with 3D faces, that may be of some help:

    Sorry - this sounds like quite a complicated request, and isn''t one that I can
