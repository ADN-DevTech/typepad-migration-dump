  body: 'I think an important but perhaps less obvious lesson here isn’t so much that
    you can consume a web service from an AutoCAD program, but how you can separate
    the concerns of your application into those that are dependent on the AutoCAD
    API, and those that are not. And whether you actually use a remote web service
    or not, just shifting your thought process into a “service-oriented” mode will
    usually result in a better design, with more loosely coupled, reusable components.


    When I really pay attention to it, I’m always surprised at how little of the code
    in my AutoCAD programs is actually dependent on the AutoCAD API. Even more separation
    can be achieved through simple abstractions (like your Circle and Sphere classes).
    Having most of your program logic in non-AutoCAD-dependent components has significant
    advantages. Those components are more reusable (say, by a program that is like
    AutoCAD but not – if such a thing exists), they are easier to maintain (they don’t
    need to be changed or recompiled for new AutoCAD releases), and they can be unit
    tested inside of Visual Studio. Oh, and of course, they can more easily be migrated
    into web services later.'

  body: 'An excellent comment, Scott (I''m happy to see a comment from "Mr. Business
    Logic" himself ;-)


    I''ll try to remember to highlight this area at some point in the series (although
    I don''t have much by way of hard and fast rules or advice to offer - a lot of
    those decisions depend on the context).


    Thanks!
