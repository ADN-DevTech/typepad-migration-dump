  body: 'I''m pretty sure Fenton Webb is delivering some (although we couldn''t include
    them in the original class list, given the timing of the Mac announcement).


    As for .NET: we''re currently only providing ObjectARX and LISP interfaces on
    the Mac, but hopefully at some point we''ll be able to provide an API with an
    object model similar to the existing .NET API (whether it''s actually .NET or
    not remains to be seen).
