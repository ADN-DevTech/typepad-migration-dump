  body: 'Kean,

    What code is needed to make the function available in all subsequent drawings?
    It appears as if the code here only applies to the drawing active when loading
    the program. The function isnt available in the next drawing one opens.

    Thx.

    Kevin.'

    Apologies for the delay - was travelling last week.


    I assume you mean the LISP code. The .NET code should just work for subsequent
    drawings, but LISP needs some extra effort.


    LISP is designed to have a separate "namespace" per document, which means you
    need to load your code into each document (although the LISPINIT system variable
    should help here). Typically you would use acad.lsp or APPLOAD''s Startup Suite
    to auto-load your code as new drawings are created.


    Cheers,

  body: 'hi Kean. Not sure you''ll ever reply, because your post is so old, anyway
    I try :-). I have been using autocad since 1991, but not using autolisp since
    many years. The other day I had to modify a stupid old function of mine, now everything
    works thanks to your post. My question: why <i>(command "_.pline")</i> works even
    if <i>_.pline</i> is not capitalized, while <i>(= (getvar "CMDNAMES") "PLINE")</i>
    needs the command name to be capitalized, otherwise doesn''t work? Ciao from Italy'

  body: 'Ciao Antonio,


    AutoCAD''s command processor doesn''t care about case, while a standard string
    comparison such as that used by by the "=" operation in LISP, is case sensitive.


    We do the extra leg-work to dispatch commands irrespective of the case of the
    string used to invoke them, but you have to do that leg-work yourself when comparing
    LISP strings (as there will be times when you certainly do care about case).


    I hope this helps explain the behaviour,
