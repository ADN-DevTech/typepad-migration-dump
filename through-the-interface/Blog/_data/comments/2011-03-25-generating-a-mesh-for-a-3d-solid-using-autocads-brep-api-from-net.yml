  body: 'Hi Kean,


    I tested your code and it works fine. But then, for more complex solids and only
    once in a while, the mesh generation fails throwing unmanaged exceptions, even
    with solids that have worked fine just before. Is this a known issue?


    Regards, Christian'

  body: 'Hi Christian,


    I''ve seen one such report of instability with complex solids + certain settings,
    but I''m not sure that qualifies this as a known issue.


    I do suggest playing with the settings a little (particular the MaxSubDivisions
    property), although I don''t like the fact a (presumably) untrappable exception
    is thrown when the going gets tough. That sounds like something we need to reproduce
    and submit to Engineering (are you an ADN member, by any chance?).

    thanks. I posted it in the ADN with sample solid.

    Great - Balaji and Viru have tracked it down, and I''ve integrated their fix into
    the above code.


    Thanks for sending the issue in!

    Is there a way to get this to read a pre-existing subd mesh surface instead of
    a solid?'

  body: 'Hi Steve,


    You mean just open a SubDMesh object and create faces from it? You could, but
    you wouldn''t use the Brep API.


    As it''s already a mesh, you should be able to access its face data more directly
    (although I haven''t tried it, admittedly).

    Anyway I will keep looking. Maybe someone has something...'

    What I need is the x,y,z coordinated of the vertices of a 3d mesh. I have code

    to put those numbers in the DB to start with is a very different animal.'

  body: Hi Kean I got this to work to pull the coordinates from the SubDMesh objects
    by drilling into the vertices.  Going to try and reverse the roles to re-draw
    them back out.  If you know of any methods to help with that would be appreciated.  Have
    a great day.
