    Where could I find the API for Autocad .Net, something similar of Java Library?

  body: 'Hello Peter,


    If you''re just looking for documentation, try <a href="http://autodesk.com/autocad-net-developers-guide">here</a>.


    Otherwise the API ships with AutoCAD, in AcMgd.dll and AcDbMgd.dll, and is also
    shipped and documented in <a href="http://autodesk.com/objectarx">the ObjectARX
    SDK</a> for that version.

  body: "Hi Kean,\n\nI was wondering if you had any more information on the 4th and\
    \ 5th parameters to the SpatialFilterDefinition constructor?\n\nSpecifically,\
    \ I am trying to clip something that exists below zero on the z-axis and the clipping\
    \ is not including any of it. Changing the 4th and 5th parameters on the SpatialFilterDefinition\
    \ to make sure the 4th is \"more negative\" than the object in question means\
    \ it is included. However I can't make dead nor tail of that the parameters are\
    \ supposed to be and it would be nice to do something that is included regardless\
    \ of z values. Might there be a way to just clip on the x-y plane and ignore the\
    \ z axis?\n\nThe ObjectARX documentation has the following:\n4th param - frontClip\
    \ - Input front clip distance in the positive extrusion direction  \n5th param\
    \ - backClip - Input back clip distance in the negative extrusion direction  \n\
    \nAny help you might be able to offer would be great!"

    I''m working with Autocad 2013 and I was trying to clip a block (like the XCLIP
    command) in C# when I found your post but unfortunatly, when I try to execute
    it on a block in my Autocad editor frame the whole block disappears even if I
    try to clip just the half of it.


    Do you know what functions are used by the XCLIP command ?'

  body: "My mistake, the function works very well but be careful  the filter definition\
    \ has a front and back clip value of 0 so if your block is not exactly at 0 altitude\
    \ it does not work.\nTo clip everything under your selection change it to :\n\
    SpatialFilterDefinition sfd =\n                new SpatialFilterDefinition(\n\
    \                    pts, Vector3d.ZAxis, 0.0, double.PositiveInfinity, double.NegativeInfinity,\
