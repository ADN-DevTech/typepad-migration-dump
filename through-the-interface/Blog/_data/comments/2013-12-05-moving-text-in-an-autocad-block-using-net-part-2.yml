    Would it be possible for us to highlight only the subentities themselves (such
    as the DBText or MText), instead of highlighting the whole block reference when
    moving the mouse over it?


    Thanks!'

  body: 'Hi Samir,


    You mean outside of a command, to control the rollover highlighting behaviour?


    I haven''t tried this myself. It''s just possible something can be done using
    a PointMonitor, but I actually suspect not. You could always just EXPLODE the
    blocks, of course. ;-)

    I actually mean as a "plus" to this post of yours :)

    When you get to the part where you need to select the text (or some other entity),
    I wonder if there''s a way we could highlight the subentities instead of the whole
    block reference when you move your mouse over them. Temporarily exploding the
    blocks recursively could definitely do the trick, but would that work for external
    references as well?'

  body: Also, exploding blocks might not have the desired effect if those blocks have
    attributes or are  XCLIPing some content, because exploding the blocks might reveal
    a lot of "clutter".

    I now understand better what you''re after. I''ll give it a try, but I expect
    it''s going to get messy... :-)
