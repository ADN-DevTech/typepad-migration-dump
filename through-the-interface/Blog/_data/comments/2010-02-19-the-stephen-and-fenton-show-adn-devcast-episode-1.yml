    There''s still no 64-bit version of Inspector, unfortunately.


    You should be able to use ArxDbg or MgdDbg (the second of which should be provided
    from this post in a 64-bit ready DLL, I believe).

  body: 'Hello Kean


    I loaded the Inspector and started it with AutoCAD 2011 German, Win XP Prof. 32,
    and it seem to work.


    But I have problem with the size of the window. I only has a size of approx. 6
    x 15 cm and I can not increase it. On the other size I can decrease the size of
    the "inner window": The "Inspector window" stays unchanged, with a caption and
    a grey area, and the "Data window" (with two horizontal scroll bars) becomes smaller
    and smaller ..

    <a href="http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/42/acadinspector.png/">http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/42/acadinspector.png/</a>


    Bug or Feature?

    Is there a way to increase the size of the window?


    Regards

    I''m not sure what the deal is with this (I''m not a heavyweight Inspector user,
    myself).


    The source code is provided, of course, in case you want to play with it.


    I will pass this on to the developers of the tool, as I believe they''ll be looking
    at it again over the coming months.

    thanks for your reply (which I mised for the last 10 days because it was not displayed
    .. - sorry). The source code oversteps my knowledge, so I have to wait for an
    update.


    Please keep the users informed.

    Hit me back if you''d like to check it out and host it as an update to this post.  That
    is, unless there are other links out there for an updated version.


    Repaired only compile errors, and left predicated calls alone, as long as they
