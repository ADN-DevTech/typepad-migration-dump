  body: "This sample is most appreciated by me - I have been really ... by the tables\
    \ so far :)\n\nThe sample works as expected. But I have some questions that you\
    \ can help me out with (I use managed C++):\n\n(1) After creating the table, it\
    \ doesn't have any style associated with it, its style id is null  - we have to\
    \ set a style to the table to get \"expected results\", right? \n\n(2) I tried\
    \ placing the table in the paper space in the layout, and it didn't show up. It\
    \ shows up properly in the model space, and the modelspace viewport in the layout.\
    \ How can I fix this in the sample?\n\nThanks for the sample!\n\nGagan\n=============="

    I copied and run the code, but the result is not like yours. The most confused
    me is the title, in my table there were three columns showed "Name" and "Material".
    How can you hide these two columns and make the "Part No" center?'

    merge code in this example. Is there any other way to do that?


    To Gagan:

    Yse, after you create a table, the TableStyle''id is null, but it has a default
    table style, which you can see in "TABLESTYLE" command in AuotCAD, it''s name
    is "default". This id will not assigned until you add the new table object to
    blocktable and commit the transaction.'

    Actually, I now realise I didn''t look very closely at the contents of the generated
    table when I put this post together...


    I didn''t use merge code - the 0,0 cell ends up being used as the title (as I
    didn''t suppress it).


    I''ll post a new entry with the updated code - email me if you need it sooner.

    Kean'
