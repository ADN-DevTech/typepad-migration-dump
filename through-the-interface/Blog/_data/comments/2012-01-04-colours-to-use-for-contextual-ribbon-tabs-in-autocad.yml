  body: 'Kean, can you say you like the ribbon interface?

    I still have not found it the right balance for any program in any situation.

    I thought it would be good for learning, but I think pulldowns make better mechanisms
    to look for commands. I thought it might be good for everyday use, but it wastes
    space compared to other things, and is visually awkward when you look up and do
    not see the command you want, then have to pick through the tabs to pick out the
    right command picture with your eyes.  Its two searching operations instead of
    one compared to pulldowns.  I still use acad toolbars when i do want a visual
    set of buttons, and I limit them to three rows.  I type regular editing commands
    so my wrist tendons do not fall to pieces like button picking with the mouse will
    do. I''m just seeing more effort plugged into the ribbon when it seems like the
    old toolbar and pulldown items should be incorporated somehow.  It might look
    cool for a bit when doing demos, but anyone I know that over-uses toolbar type
    drawing habits, comes to work with those black wrist thingy''s on their right
    hand wrist.  they get little sympathy from me and I fell like Autodesk is encouraging
    such habits.'

  body: 'I actually can say I like the ribbon, but then I''m not a power-user of our
    software: for my purposes it''s great - it makes our various products much more
    discoverable when I have to dip into them and use the odd command.


    And contextual ribbon tabs are pretty powerful when you want in-command input,
    I also find.


    I''ve seen other people sharing your opinion, though: thankfully the classic UI
    is available for those who prefer it.

  body: 'yah, I will keep looking at it for advantages, it does seem like a good idea
    on paper at least.

    On this same subject, you are playing with the kinect as an input device, I wonder
    what other kinds of input devices would be realistic to look at.

    Now that there is the netduino device, I bet we could come up with various sensors
    and switches to help minimize hand input.  In particular, I use the middle mouse
    button click to pull up the osnap menu, then type E for endpoint mnmonic.  You
    can do all that without moving the mouse from where you will click, so its super
    fast.  Running osnaps are worthless on civil drawings with any amount of xrefs...anyway,
    just finding an alternate way to issue the middle mouse button click would be
    major.  Maybe a foot pedal, since I tap my foot to music a lot.  Any ideas since
    you see lots of other software?'

  body: 'I haven''t personally seen anything that beats the middle mouse button, but
    then lots of heads-down drafters/designers swear by devices such as the SpaceMouse.


    It has to be said that the Human-Computer Interaction space is one that appears
    to be on the brink of rapid evolution, though.

  body: I thought about this a bit, and think foot pedal input is not so great. It
    would fatigue your legs.  The far better solution is voice input. I wonder how
    .net could help there.
