    I might be misunderstanding something here, but how do you use asynchronous logic
    with AutoCAD? My understanding is that AutoCAD ensures that from a plugin''s perspective,
    everything is singularly threaded?

  body: 'Hi Gavin,


    This particular code is retrieving data from the web, before it gets combined
    and imported into AutoCAD using standard commands.


    As the code that executes after the await calls runs by default on the UI thread
    (from which it''s safe to call into AutoCAD), it should work very well: you just
    need to be careful not to create some kind of asychronous method that attempts
    to do something directly inside AutoCAD. That would fail and probably quite nastily.


    Regards,


    Kean'

  body: It is indeed astonishing how few code changes were necessary to make this
    work. As we wait for .NET 5, I have found Parallel LINQ (PLINQ) quite useful for
    tasks like this. I'm too lazy to learn F# at this point.
