    Las vegas in such a short notice.


    And, by the way, weren''t we talking about Cloud computing and application delocation?
    Should I send an avatar? :D


    Just kidding, but seriously, next time think also to us who live outside US!'

  body: 'I understand completely - if you''re not already considering going to the
    event - or you live relatively locally - then it''s probably not a good idea to
    enter, at this stage.


    I think this is the first time we''ve tried a contest like this (at least as far
    as I can recall - not including informal contests on this blog), so it''s probably
    a case of "you have to start somewhere".


    I do like the idea of having a virtual presence collecting your prize, although
    avatars aren''t usually very good at carrying tablets. ;-)

  body: 'With ADN Open now in place, doesn''t that mean that anyone at all is eligible
    for the contest? As long as they have sufficient free time and a big travel budget,
    that is.


    I won''t be entering, but I was amused by the irony of the push-the-cloud and
    must-be-physically-present aspects, so thanks for the lulz.
