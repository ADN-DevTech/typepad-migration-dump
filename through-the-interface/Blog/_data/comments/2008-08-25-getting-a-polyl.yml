  body: "Kean,\n\nProblem 1: \n\nIf the region has a hole the routine probably will\
    \ fail once you cannot created either a disconnected polyline or a multi-polyline\
    \ inside AutoCAD.\n\nProblem 2:\n\nIf you have a composed region with disconnected\
    \ loops the explode will return 2 new regions at it first call. The routine should\
    \ repeat the explode until it does not find any AcDbRegion entity anymore.\n\n\
    Problem 3:\n\nDepending on how the region is built you may end up with two or\
    \ more coincident curve segments. The polyline build routine should be able to\
    \ ignore this duplicated curves.\n\nI have faced these problems with a routine\
    \ I have made to deal with regions but I have not checked if this sample will\
    \ face the same problems but probably it will! :)\n\nRegards,\nFernando."

    I knew there had to be some cases I''d missed - I''ll update the code and post
    an update later in the week.

    Do you really want to learn how to type fast?

    Many years ago, I got a software to teach typing of an unusual way (to me).

    I never found it again, so I wrote my own.

    Don''t worry about, because it''s not a virus.

    If you like, I can send to you the source code (VB.NET)

    Enjoy!

  body: 'Hi Kean,

    I''m not sure why, but your coordinate transformation are not inverse. When I
    transform the polyline back, it''s deformed, so I replaced the Convert2d(pl) method
    with TransformBy(Matrix3d.WorldToPlane(pl)) and it works good.

    It returns Point3d, so you also have to transform it to Point2d.'

  body: 'Hi Matus,


    It''s a long time since I posted this, so I''m surprised there''s a problem that
    hasn''t yet been reported.


    Before I build it into an app to re-test, it would be good to know exactly the
    sequence of operations I need to follow to make it fail. Maybe you can send me
    instructions - ideally with a DWG - by email?


    Cheers,

    You''re quite right: I somehow missed that.


    I''ll post an update to <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2008/08/creating-a-seri.html">the
    next post</a>, as that''s an evolution of the code in this one.
