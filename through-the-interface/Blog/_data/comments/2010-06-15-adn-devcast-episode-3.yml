    First, my favorite API funcion is close() because it means you have finish some
    loop and can test it. :)


    Ok, I have some questions about Point Clouds for you:


    Suppose you have scanned a table (as you did) and want to generate a surface (a
    face, shell or mesh) from it. It would be just a matter of analyze the coplanar
    points and use them to generate those entities? What about more organic objects
    like fancy chairs?


    I think the Point Cloud is a fantastic input but how much better would be converting
    the cloud into AutoCAD entities like faces, meshes, regions, etc.?


    Can you elaborate on this?


    Best regards.'

    Creating more useful objects whether automatically or semi-automatically from
    point clouds is certainly desirable functionality.


    There are indeed partners who provide this kind of functionality (although I haven''t
    used any such product, myself).


    And, as you know, I can''t comment here on Autodesk''s plans (even confirming
    whether or not they exist) for products that have not been announced publicly.
