  body: I think  that sounds like a very good idea.  But, please make sure you do
    tie in the mathematical concepts with AutoCad's geometry library (as you already
    mentioned).  In other words, show how the theory is applied in practice.  Looking
    forward to reading what you come up with.

  body: Agreed! I don't have any formal training in linear algebra, having only gone
    to a tech school for CAD, and I don't remeber getting into any complex mathematics.
    All the .net programming I've learned after the move away from vba in autocad,
    so learning how to do anything in .net was learned through blood, sweat, and tears!
    And I'm sure I'm not the only one in this boat B)

    Cover the basics using common problems. Things like :


    -Various ways to project points. Using a matrix, vectors, trig. All have an appropriate
    time and place. One must select the correct representation based on what AutoCAD
    expects. So understanding how and when to select a representation is the very
    basis to understanding the AutoCAD math library.


    -Basic solutions to common problems like: Is a point inside a polyline? Is one
    polyline contained within another? Completely? By how much?


    -How do we “Look” using math? If I have an object, how do I “Look” around to see
    what’s near it?


    -Understanding how to move geometry from one space to another. For instance; If
    I want to see if a line in the current drawing intersects with a line in an xref
    (that may be scales or drawing in other units)


    -In the same vein, comparing objects to objects contained in blocks. Perhaps by
    building abstract versions of each block for fast compares.


    -All of the “Select” commands work using the video buffer. How would you implement
    the math to compare against all the different types? What I mean is; what base
    class(s) do you select and when?


    We can use this as an excuse to build a “Poor” mans AutoCAD math library.'

    I would say that although there is indeed a lot of information on this topic on
    the Internet, it is always treated and explained in a very general manner and
    I think that a more applied approach, explaining how all this abstract information
    concretely applies to AutoCAD entities and APIs (starting with AutoLISP), would
    be more than welcome.


    Thanks in advance,'

  body: 'Kean,


    Thanks for the question.  My issue, like a couple other commenters here, is that
    I last took math more than 20 years ago, and it wasn''t in a programming context.  I''m
    an architect by training, so I''m more visual anyway.  I don''t understand how
    to solve many 2D geometry programming problems, much less the 3D that''s required
    these days.


    I recently had a geometry question for an AutoCAD app that should be relatively
    simple for math wizards, diagrammed here: <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Circle-CircleTangents.html.">http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Circle-CircleTangents.html.</a>  I
    simply needed to solve for the various tangent points given the two circles.  And,
    I needed to do it with code.  So, even if I understood the math involved, translating
    that to .NET was more than I could handle.  Many Google searches turned up nothing
    that I could use or could translate, and perhaps I wasn''t even sure what to search
    for (Circle Circle Tangent, Serpentine pulleys, timing belts, etc).


    I was thinking at the time that it would be great if there were a community site
    where people would post diagrams like this, and beneath it would be .NET or AutoCAD
    code that would solve for the various X,Y,Z points (or other variables).  I think
    that if you look at the breadth of information on the mathworld site, you''re
    looking at potentially a ton of blog posts, so I would suggest a separate site
    of some sort.


    BTW, if anyone can ''teach me to fish'' on this particular problem, I would really
    appreciate some references.


    Great to see you at AU, and thanks again for the blog!

    This is a level of complexity that I would expect AutoCAD to handle: in this case
    applying tangential constraints between the circles and the lines, rather than
    making the calculations manually.

  body: 'Hi,

    i think there is a point not mentioned yet...


    It is very useful and important to be able to tap (or hook)

    directly into the "mathematics"(equations) underlying a CAD-object like a curve
    (3Dspline) or surface (NURBS or analytic) in order to programmatically calculate
    "things" like Torsion, Carvature, Local and Global Minimas and Maximas needing
    the third derivative of the the curve of Surface at a given Point or some other
    higher analytic  maths.


    The API''S expose Properties and Methods of Objects but not their underlying mathematics,
    the parametric equations for example of a Curve or Surface!


    So I would suggest to think in this Direction and expose directly the mathematical
    equations of certain Objects either by providing the necessary API Methods or
    interactively through AutoCAD Commands.


    The implementation let say of a sort of "reverse engineering" of the object mathematics
    would be very useful for Generative or Parametric Modeling or even to explore
    the mathematics of a NURBS Surface or a SPLINE in 3D Space (WKS or UCS)


    So imagine to select a Curve or Surface on the Screen and

    obtain its mathematical Equation in parametric, explicit or Implicit Form..!!!???


    The forthcoming DesignScript programming language for AutoCAD and possibly other
    Autodesk Products(AU 2010 ?) would benefit from such a paradigm of CAD-mathematics-exposure.


    Linear Algebra and Matrix Maths for geometry transformations are important but
    equally important is a mathematical exposure of the underlying structure or equations
    of CAD objects where desirable and appropriate.


    Many Thanks to all for the useful ideas and websites

  body: 'Fair enough.  In this case however, I was attempting a DrawableOverrule and
    I didn''t have the luxury of using constraints.  I also needed to remove all the
    internal geometry inside the circles and between the external tangent lines, leaving
    only arc segments at the ends and the tangent lines.  If we expand my example
    beyond AutoCAD to other Autodesk APIs, I also might need to make the calculations
    manually because of their geometry library limitations.  So, this one example
    may be handled by AutoCAD''s internal geometry APIs (if so, I might need code
    for that too), but the underlying manual calculations might be useful in a variety
    of applications and contexts.  Clearly, I''m suggesting something beyond the scope
    of what you''re looking to do, but a guy can dream a little right?  ;-)
