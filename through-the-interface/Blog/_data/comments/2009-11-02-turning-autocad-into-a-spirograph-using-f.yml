    If only that were the case, John!


    But it is true that if I can find a way to combine a little fun with some serious
    work (that of brushing up on F#) then I''ll do so. :-)

    If it''s a good topic for a blog post then I''d be happy to take a look. My email
    address is on my About page, in case, but bear in mind I''m on vacation this week
    (and in any case can''t commit to when I''ll get time to look into it).


    Cheers,


    Kean
