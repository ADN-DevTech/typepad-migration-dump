  body: 'Thank you - that''s a very nice thing to say.


    I did offer to participate way back when the idea of the Portathon was first being
    kicked around, but I haven''t followed up on the offer (the ADN team is reqlly
    managing the show, and seems to have it all well in hand).


    I''ll probably check in and see if there''s a low-key (i.e. not requiring much
    prep) way that I can participate.
