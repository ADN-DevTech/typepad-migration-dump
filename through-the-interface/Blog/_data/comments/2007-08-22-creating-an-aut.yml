  body: I have code in vb that does the same thing but I need to have it specify the
    range name that is predefined in the excel file in the datalink options and I
    can not for the life of me figure out how to programmably do it. I figure if you
    can do it manually there should be a way in code.

    related to one of my posts (i.e. there''s a problem with code I''ve posted).
