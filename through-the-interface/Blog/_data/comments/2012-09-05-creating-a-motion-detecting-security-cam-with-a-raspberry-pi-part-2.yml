    My vi skills were just about good enough to get me through a simple change,  but

    I''m not sure how you''d make the change permanent, but then if you''re not adding

    I am working on a raspberry pi project, to connect the raspberry pi to a webcam

    I don''t have much experience with setting up a real-time webcam feed, but I have
    done so using Motion (and it''s really easy to do so).


    If you follow the instructions in this post, it should just work.


    Then you simply need to write some kind of iOS app - presumably using Safari or
    Webkit directly - to consume the feed via HTTP.


    There may be better ways to do all his, but Motion is the way I''ve happened to
    have done it, myself.

    you need to set the appropriate setting in the motion.conf file (daemon=on, I
    think).


    To have the Motion daemon start when the device boots up, you can edit rc.conf:


    sudo nano /etc/rc.conf


    and then edit this line to include @motion (which starts the Motion daemon in
    the background - not sure the ''@'' is really needed, but anyway):


    DAEMONS=(!hwclock syslog-ng network openntpd @netfs @crond @sshd @motion)

    A lot of this stuff is very webcam-specific, it seems. You should try adjusting
    the settings (reducing resolution can help) but you might also just need a powered
    USB hub (some webcams take more power than the Pi''s board can provide).


    And then again, your webcam may just not be compatible. This page may be of use:

    The Motion sub-system supports multiple cams, although with the R-Pi you may need

    I''ve got the upload happening, but I get an error when the uploader looks for
    e.g. /motion/01-20121221160.jpg ("No such file or directory") since the jpegs
    saved have the frame number appended, e.g. /motion/01-20121221160-01.jpg. As a
    result, the process stops after the upload, so no email and no deleting the local

    I''ve used a combination of your motion.conf and the original motion.conf to get
    it working to this stage (the original webcam settings worked better for me),

    Not sure what to suggest... I''d try to make sure it''s finding the VidTest.jpg
    file. Beyond that I''d probably simplify the email contents, to see if that helps
    (and then introduce more complexity once you know that works).

    This meant that the test script now works, uploaded the video and sent the email.


    Unfortunately, although videos are recording (at around triple speed, not sure

  body: 'Great tutorial Kean! Pleased to say I''ve successfully used it to set up
    two separate Raspberry Pi based webcams and, eventually, I intend to use it in
    a ''bird box'' project.


    I used to be able to view the live stream remotely on both cams using Firefox
    or Chrome (never IE though) then the other day I couldn''t access either, no matter
    what browser I used, remotely or locally. I''m wondering if they''ve made a change
    to Motion - nothing else has changed as far as I can see and I can still access
    the streams through VLC but I miss the accessibility of using a browser.


    I did also try to set up your project using Raspbian (find it much easier to use)
    but couldn''t get the Python script to work and I''m a Linux beginner so gave
    up on that quickly - any advice would be appreciated!


    Anyway, just wanted to extend a big ''Thank you'' for posting - keep up the great
    work!'
