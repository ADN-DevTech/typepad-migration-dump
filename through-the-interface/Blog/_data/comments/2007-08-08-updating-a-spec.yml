    why we didnt use selection sets to update the block attributes in the above example?


    Can we use selection sets in RealDWG?


    Thanks,

    I have a little question : is it faster to use RealDWG than using the native AutoCAD
    process shown on the previous relied post ?


    Thanks,

  body: 'Hi Leo,


    In general it''s going to be quicker - as you have less code that''s running -
    but if you disregard the time needed to launch AutoCAD then the difference is
    likely to be marginal.
