    I see the DLL's are there.

  body: it works in A2008, however, the balloon notificaction is justified to the
    left hand side of the screen with the 'communication dish' icon residing over
    the 'draw' menu even though the communication area is on the right hand side

    Actually, yes - now that I''ve tried it in 2008, I see the balloon there, too
    (and on the right, as in 2009 - not sure what''s different about your configuration).


    Our internal design docs implied this was 2009 only, but it seems it was there
    as an undocumented/unsupported API in 2008.

    Civil 3d 2009. I inserted code on initializing my application when loading to

    It is working only in debug mode after netload.When I make setup to my application,

    a balloon notification not displayed on the start AutoCAD when application loaded.

    What''s wrong? Thank you for your advice'

  body: 'Hi Michael,


    I assume you''re automatically loading your module at startup of Civil 3D? If
    so, this kind of thing sometimes happens when an application initialization depends
    on a document being available when one actually isn''t yet there. I''m not 100%
    sure this is the case, but this is what it feels like based on the information
    you''ve provided.


    Why exactly the balloon notification mechanism should depend on a document being
    available is another question (not one that I have an answer for, off the top
    of my head).


    One option might be to "queue up" a command as your app initializes, which then
    executes once a doc is available. Check ads_queueexpr() in <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2006/08/calling_command.html">this
    post</a>, to see if that helps.
