  body: 'Being someone who has done a fair amount of VB and lots of lisp, I am always
    looking for improving in .net skills.

    I get the basics, and can learn most things as they are needed, but its hard to
    find people explaining design patterns used for real applications.

    I would like to see how others organize their helper functions, and how they distribute
    the final programs.


    Another topic would be a demo of a program that uses .net for dialogs in a lisp
    prog.  Maybe that one class listed does that, but most classes were too shallow
    that I went to last year.  Even picking a few of your blog posts to walk through
    in class, so people could pick your brain on things.


    If you had a class on "things you can do with dbx and .net" I''m sure it would
    be filled up faast.'

    I''ll certainly pass on the feedback - while the classes are pretty much set,
    at this stage, this will help us focus/adjust the content of relevant classes.
