    You might take a look at using THREE.js (<a href="http://mrdoob.github.com/three.js/)">http://mrdoob.github.com/three.js/)</a>
    as a way of rendering 3D graphics on HTML5 enabled web browsers.  We''ve been
    pleased with the capabilities of this library.

    Interesting - thanks!

    this series, at some point, so this may help a lot.


    Cheers,
