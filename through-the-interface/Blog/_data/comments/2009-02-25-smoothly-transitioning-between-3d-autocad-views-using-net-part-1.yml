  body: "Kean,\n\nI'd first like to thank you for this post, it helped me a lot.\n\
    \nI'm developing an addin that lets the user move the active view using an external\
    \ input system. I guess one way to do that is using <i>GraphicsSystem.View</i>\
    \ Orbit Roll and Pan functions. \n\nWhat I'm basically doing is continuously fetching\
    \ data and moving the view accordingly.\n\nBut I've got troubles having my view\
    \ move and keeping the AutoCAD GUI unfreezed. As soon as I need my module to be\
    \ running all the time in background to manage the view, I thought using a thread\
    \ to refresh the window would be a good idea but I read it wasn't possible.\n\n\
    Is there a nice and smart way to do that ?\n\nThanks !"

    This is beyond my expertise - I suggest submitting it via ADN (if you''re not
    currently a member and are working on this kind of project, you really should
    be :-).


    Regards,

    Thank you for answering that fast. I doubt I''ll be able to subscribe to ADN right
    now but I''ll try influencing my hierarchy !


    Didn''t think it was that complicated to do with AutoCAD actually. Thank you again!
