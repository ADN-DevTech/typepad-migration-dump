  body: 'Hello Kean,

    Is it possible to add a row dynamically (using .net code) to an existing table?


    I receive an eexception "eNonApplicable" when I try to do this in my c# code:


    myInfoTable.NumRows++


    If it is possible, what are the steps needed to perform this operation?


    Thank you.'

    You should be able to, but not just by incrementing the count.


    Have you tried using myInfoTable.InsertRows()?

  body: 'It''s strange, because NumRows++ works for the first time. It redimension
    the table from 1 to 2 rows without loosing data.

    The InsertRows() method works fine but makes the table loosing its previows content.

    Any Idea?

    I was also trying DataTable object wich is a wrapper for acDbDataTable to store
    information but there is not information about this object.


    Thank you very much.'

  body: I know this post is old, but just FYI, Table.NumRows is deprecated.  The docs
    suggest using Table.Rows.Count, but you can't set the number of rows using that.  Table.InsertRows
    is the way to go.
