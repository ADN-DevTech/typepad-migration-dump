  body: 'and its only in 2D?????

    Kidding, but here we have a full 3d programmable graphics platform, and its back
    to space invaders....

    How about Angry Blocks or 3d asteroids?

    Considering the power of my phone, I spend more time on the toys on it than the
    email or "real" uses it has.'
