  body: Kean, thank you. Before using your code I should add that AutoCAD documentation
    is not perfectly exact. The legacy leader object can be annotative too but scale
    influence on it is sometimes inpredictable.

    Is there a way to do this (adding annotation scales) but via the COM API (ActiveX/VBA)?

    I don''t know, sorry. I tend only to use COM when I can''t do what I want from
    .NET. You might try posting to the appropriate discussion forum, to see if anyone
    there can help.

  body: 'Kean-


    After searching for a couple of days, I thought I would ask here. When you first
    open a new drawing and attempt to insert an annotative object, AutoCAD knows whether
    or not the user has set and annotative scale for the drawing and (by default)
    pops up a dialog to prompt the user to set annotative scale. I noticed that the
    default CANNOSCALE is 1, which is a valid option, and was wondering how AutoCAD
    determines if the user has already set the scaling and whether this is exposed
    to .NET?'

  body: 'Scott,


    Does Database.Cannoscale give you what you want?


    Otherwise perhaps you can query the ObjectContextCollection, as shown above.


    This isn''t an area I spend much time with, admittedly, so I could easily be missing
    the point.

    As I''m pretty sure I mentioned in my reply to your other comment, I really don''t
    have time to provide support. Please post your question via ADN or on the AutoCAD
