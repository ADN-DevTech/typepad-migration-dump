    that having a 64-bit capable version does give the technology a brighter future
    than it had.


    I don''t know how VBA has been integrated into Office in recent years, I admit,
    but I have to assume it''s there.

    There will indeed be a corresponding ObjectARX SDK. As it''s a binary application

    Lucas,


    You can use acedSetVar() from ObjectARX to do this, or you might write to the
    keys in "HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Autodesk\AutoCAD\R19.1\ACAD-D001:409\Profiles\<<Unnamed
    Profile>>\Variables", if you really needed to.


    For the domains, you might want to pick up the default value from here, to make
    sure you don''t break anything by removing existing domains from the list: "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Autodesk\AutoCAD\R19.1\ACAD-D001\Variables\TRUSTEDDOMAINS".


    The best, of course, is to use Autoloader to avoid all of this.

    daily used applications like excel/word etc) without tons of documents which show

  body: 'Hello Kean


    Thanks for the in depth information. I was triggered by the Design Feed feature
    you mentioned. In my situation TRUSTEDPATHS caused some challenges.


    An out of the box bare AutoCAD install is manipulated with a /b switch in the
    short cut of acad.exe. This .scr-script contains some LISP and sets TRUSTEDPATHS,
    then chain loads menu''s, settings, changing SFSP, etcetera, all with LISP, ending
    in a standardized AutoCAD environment. This worked fine, even in AutoCAD 2014.
    Working with profiles is not an option, the systems are reset every day to out
    of the box state. There is a caveat, the /b switch calls code that sets TRUSTEDPATHS
    and that should be impossible but it works. That is... it works when the script
    is on a local drive. Unfortunately it should be run from a network location and
    that offers the dialogue box with the warning about running code outside the trusted
    zone.


    This is a show stopper and I decided to put everything in a .bundle under %appdata%.
    Works like a charm except for one thing: after acaddoc.lsp is loaded some additional
    commands are issued: RIBBON, COMMANDLINE and DESIGNFEED. Without using the Autoloader
    these commands are not issued.


    Can you tell me where these commands are defined? Or maybe to get a solution,
    how can RIBBONCLOSE, DESIGNFEEDCLOSE be issued from the described chain loading
    process after acaddoc.lsp has run? Off the record, since 360 is not installed
    the Design Feed pane gives an ugly error "net:ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED".

    In general I ask people to post their questions - especially complex ones, such
    as this - to ADN or the appropriate online discussion group.


    Just a quick comment, though: it''s more likely that the /b switch is topping
    the RIBBON, COMMANDLINE and DESIGNFEED commands from being called (rather than
    the Autoloader adding them). They are standard commands that are typically called
    on AutoCAD startup assuming that these UI elements are visible (not sure about
    DESIGNFEED - sounds as though you don''t use that).


    Anyway, this issue probably needs assistance from someone in Support, so please
    do ask ADN or the forums.

    In the mean time I''ll try to play a bit with the /b switch to create a work around.'

    The ObjectARX Wizard should be able to help you create a C++ project. I don''t
    know whether the ObjectARX Wizard (which is a real plugin to VS rather than a

    from an ObjectARX sample, instead.
