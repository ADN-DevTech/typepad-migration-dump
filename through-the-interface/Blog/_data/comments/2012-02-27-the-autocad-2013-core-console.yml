    The Core Console has only been tested with a few specific scenarios in mind (it''s
    used for a few features inside AutoCAD, but has not been tested extensively for
    general capabilities). P/Invoking acedEvaluateLisp() is likely not to have been
    tested - although from my brief look at the forum post I can''t say whether the
    issue is with your code or due to an internal implementation issue.


    Hopefully someone on the ADN team will be monitoring the discussion group and
    can comment.
