    One of the problems with the actor model is that behavior is mixed in with the
    execution strategy. In your case the execution strategy looks like it is taking
    a list of thunks and evaluating them in parallel while monitoring progress and
    given the ability to cancel. This could be a reusable component.


    Have you tried doing something with PLINQ? Perhaps there is some way of extending
    it?
