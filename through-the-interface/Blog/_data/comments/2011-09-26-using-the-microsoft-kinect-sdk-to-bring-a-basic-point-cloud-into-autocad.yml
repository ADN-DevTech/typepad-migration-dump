  body: 'hey Kean

    this is a series of really amazing posts, really is great work !I would like to
    know what you finally did... ?

    did you Use AutoCAD 2012 32-bit on 32 bit windows 7 or

    AutoCAD 2012 64 bit on 32 bit windows 7

    or some other combo ??

    because i have 64 bit windows and was pondering on which version of AutoCAD 2012
    to go for. i need you help on this as soon as you can, ''cause i''m in a hurry
    to get something else out of this. Thanks. Great work again.'

  body: Hello, I know this is an old post, but does this method still work with the
    official SDK (v1.5 at this point)? I know a lot of the namespaces changed, and
    even the call to the reference library Microsoft.Kinect is different. This is
    the best implementation I have seen of applying the point cloud data into a CAD
    program (outside of the PCL library which for various reasons was abandoned for
    my project - I need to run it in C# for the performance). I wanted to be sure
    that this method still applies before trying my hand at the code. Thanks in advance
    for your time, and sorry for bringing a post bag from the dead!

    Not a problem - most comments are on posts a lot older than this one. :-)


    This post has a link to the updated samples for v1.5 of the Kinect SDK:

    The technique is still very much valid. You may need a few minor tweaks to the
    project if you''re using an older version of AutoCAD.


    Cheers,

  body: hey bro do you know if this can be done by using 2 or more normal cameras
    or only pictures instead of using the kinect

    You might want to look at 123D Catch, to see what that can do. You won''t get
    realtime reponses anytime soon when attempting 3D reconstruction, but I do see
    some long-term synergy with AR.

  body: 'Hello Alex,


    Here''s a quick attempt at some introductory instructions.


    I''d start with the latest set of samples (at the timr of writing that means those
    for the Kinect for Windows SDK 1.6):


    <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2012/11/updated-autocad-integration-samples-for-kinect-sdk-v16.html">http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2012/11/updated-autocad-integration-samples-for-kinect-sdk-v16.html</a>


    You''ll need to install the KfW SDK and Developer Toolkit (this is needed for
    the Face Tracking component). You should also install the appropriate ObjectARX
    SDK for your version of AutoCAD (it includes reference assemblies for the AutoCAD
    .NET API, AcMgd.dll, AcDbMgd.dll and AcCoreMgd.dll).


    After loading the Kinect Samples project in Visual Studio 2010, you may need to
    add reference paths to the inc folder of the ObjectARX SDK  and to the Kinect
    SDK install folder (probably "C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Kinect\v1.6\Assemblies"
    and an equivalent one for the Developer Toolkit).


    Once you''ve built the project, you can hopefully NETLOAD the resultant DLL inside
    AutoCAD and execute one of the commands (start typing "KIN" - they all start with
    that prefix... if you don''t see any listed, the DLL isn''t loaded). If the command
    starts but you don''t see anything, try loading the Kinect.dwg file - this has
    a useable view on the Kinect data set up.


    I hope this helps,


    Kean
