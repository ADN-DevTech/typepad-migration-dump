  body: 'There''s certainly no need to learn it: it''s another tool that may be of
    use to developers working in certain domains. The Wikipedia link in the article
    should be of some use in understanding the basic concepts of functional programming
    languages, otherwise <a href="http://geekswithblogs.net/akraus1/articles/79880.aspx">this
    page</a> has a quite good explanation/comparison.

  body: 'Kean,


    Will the F# open an opportunity to Autodesk replaces the AutoLISP language?

    F# is a functional programming as AutoLISP so it would be easier to create a cross-language
    conversion tool to migrate AutoLISP code to F#?

    Maybe Autodesk is planning to create its own .NET based AutoLISP...say A# ? :)


    Please keep posting information about F# x AutoCAD.

  body: 'There are no plans to replace AutoLISP with F# (and I don''t see us having
    any in my lifetime): the F# language is likely to be of use to developers integrating
    math-intensive/simulation technologies with AutoCAD (and other, yet-to-be-determined-by-me-at-least
    uses), but it is not an easy leap, even from LISP.


    I''d like to gather information on what we might do inside AutoCAD to make F#
    a more natural environment for development, but only to provide tighter integration
    of an additional language option.

  body: With Lisp one could use a function from a text string in a database (for example
    "(setq QTY (* 2.5 WIDTH))" to calculate part specific quantities for BOM:s. I
    haven't found a way to do this in vb(.net), perhaps F# could do the trick?

  body: 'Hi Thomas,


    Yes - one of the features of LISP is the (eval) function.


    It doesn''t appeat to be native functionality in either C# or VB.NET, but it does
    appear to be possible to implement:


    <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/csharp/evalcscode.asp">http://www.codeproject.com/csharp/evalcscode.asp</a>

    <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/vb/net/expression_evaluator.asp">http://www.codeproject.com/vb/net/expression_evaluator.asp</a>


    It remains to be seen whether either technique can be used to call through AutoCAD''s
    managed API (the first one seems likely, I haven''t really looked into the implementation
    of the second).


    The equivalent in F# appears to be the <a href="http://cs.hubfs.net/blogs/tomasp/archive/2006/07/07/413.aspx">quotations</a>
    mechanism.

  body: 'Are there any extra dependencies on the F#-compiled dll as compared to a
    C#-compiled one?


    I can run this example fine on my machine, but my colleague cannot get the TEST
    command after he NETLOADs the dll.


    Would you have any guess why?


    It''s always tricky to debug things that work on one machine and not the other,
    when there''s no obvious difference in the setup. He doesn''t have F# installed,
    but I''m assuming that''s not necessary?


    Any ideas would be greatly appreciated.

  body: 'While F# code does compile down to IL, it does depend on certain new namespaces
    implemented in assemblies that are installed by with the F# implementation. So
    you will (for now) need to install F# on machines running the code, until it becomes
    a more fully integrated part of Visual Studio and probably the .NET Framework.

  body: Just for completeness, I should mention that it's possible to remove the dependency
    of an F# application to the F# assemblies by compiling with the --standalone flag.
    This has the disadvantage of adding about 1Mb to the application as it statistically
    links the F# library.
