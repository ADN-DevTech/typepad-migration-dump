  body: 'Congratulations on your blogging tenacity! Five hundred posts is a monumental
    accomplishment in this age of short attention span theater. Personally I am glad
    to be closing in on my 200th blog entry. If I could match your accomplishment
    I''d have to commemorate the event with a small statue or something. Maybe a garden
    gnome of myself.


    Of course your content far exceeds what can be found on my own and many many other
    sites. So that is 500 very well written and informative posts. THAT is really
    something to be proud of.


    Again, congratulations and may your undies soon find you in your travels abroad.

    around 220 C# files comprising 35,500 lines of code and 4,850 lines of comments.
    I checked a folder which may have multiple copies of some files and will be missing
    others, but that''s the ballpark. :-)
