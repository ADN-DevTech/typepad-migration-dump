    I hope you take this as a challenge :)


    Create a layer filter that when selected, filters all layers except those used
    by the current pickfirst selection.'

    Wow, what a neat idea. But sadly <a href="http://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/be+beyond+ken">beyond
    my ken</a>.


    Thanks for the suggestion, though!

  body: 'Hi Kean,

    I''m the one that instigated this original question about group filters. That
    part is working fine and I can also set the active group filter in the file. Now

    parent filter at the root?


    Thanks,

    Mike'
