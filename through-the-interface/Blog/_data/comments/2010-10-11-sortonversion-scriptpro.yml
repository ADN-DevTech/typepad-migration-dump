  body: I find this really interesting because I was tasked with doing something similar
    just this afternoon. Except in my case all I am doing is touch every file in a
    given directory or drive to update the modified date. This allows our backup schema
    to pickup a change and backup the file that night. Long story but it goes to company
    policy. So Kean great post.

  body: "To cover the backup for your script, possibly have an \"Archive\" directory\
    \ either in that folder or somewhere else that copies first the files for backup\
    \ and then does the move? Simple, possibly memory intensive depending on the hard\
    \ drive space and size of files. \n\nOnly other thought would be a backup copy\
    \ of the file system in memory which allows a \"restore\" of the moved files until\
    \ the program is closed or a time out period system wise."
