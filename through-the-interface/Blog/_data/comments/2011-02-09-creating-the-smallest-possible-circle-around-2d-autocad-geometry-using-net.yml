    With respect to the remaining margin of error, you may want to reduce the number
    of points using the graham scan algorithm in advance. See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_scan">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_scan</a>
    for some pseudo code and explanation.


    I only have an implementation in VLisp at the time and posting code in comments
    seems to be anoying. Therefore, let me know, if you would prefere it over pseudo
    code, so I can send you an email.'

  body: 'Hi Martin,


    Thanks - I was thinking about tackling the creation of a convex hull, at some
    point. I don''t know whether it would a) reduce the margin of error or b) improve
    performance of the posted algorithm, but it''s certainly a topic worth covering
    on its own, at the very least.


    I''ll definitely let you know if I struggle with the pseudocode. :-)

    That should be straightforward enough... I''ll see what I can put together.


    I assume the rectangle should be aligned with the UCS?
