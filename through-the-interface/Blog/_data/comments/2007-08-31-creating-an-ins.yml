    I would like to ask if it is possible to create a "ADN members" option at the
    class registration page so this way ADN members can register fast by typing its
    ADN login and password.


    Regards,

    Fernando.'

  body: 'Hi Fernando,


    I can see why that''s a bit of a pain and I''ll pass the feedback on. Most people
    don''t register for training very often, so this hasn''t come up before, that
    I''m aware of. Now that we have regular webcasts on advanced topics it might certainly
    be more awkward for people.


    Have you seen whether auto-fill functionality such as provided by the Google Toolbar
    helps?


    Regards,

    I don''t use Google Toolbar but I will test it.
