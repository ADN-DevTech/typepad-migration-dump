  body: The implications here are mind numbing. How long before our friends at Autodesk
    enable BIM manipulation this way? Perhaps even with an API similar to what was
    available years ago with Mapguide 6.5? . . . . Well I guess I can dream. . .

    Only fairly briefly. I did take a cursory look at others, but didn''t perform
    an in-depth comparison.


    I was very happy with THREE.js, I have to say, although I''m sure its "competitors"
    have their merits, too.
