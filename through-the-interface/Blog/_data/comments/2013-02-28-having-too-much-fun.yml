  body: 'You know I had bought a GoPro-like device (the Infinity CamOne) which I used
    to record <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2012/10/creating-a-face-recognising-security-cam-with-a-raspberry-pi-part-4.html">exactly
    one video</a> before I went and lost it. At least I think I lost it: I keep hoping
    it''ll show up in a cupboard somewhere, so I haven''t yet replaced it.


    But trust me, Joe, you''re not missing much. I only started learning to snowboard
    in my 20s (having grown up in East Anglia, an extremely flat part of the UK),
    by which point the fear had already set in. I''ve actually made pretty decent
    progress this season - as we''ve managed to go up so often now that the kids are
    older - but I''m not going to win any awards. At least not the kind of awards
    you''re proud of winning. :-)
