    I have tried with Firefox and IE.

  body: 'I have a VB function which does exactly what your HighlightBubbles function
    does, except I''m asking the user to select certain block references, then I retrieve
    some data from the block, display cumulative information, highlight the block
    so they can keep track of the ones they have already selected, and ask them to
    select the next block.  My highlight function just does the highlight part, on
    a single objectid instead of a group of them.


    the problem is, only the first object selected highlights properly, and I''m not
    sure if that is because of my highlight function or if it simply highlights because
    of using the editor.GetEntity method. any suggestions?'

  body: 'Nevermind... I have no idea what was going on, but I''ve been tweaking it
    repeatedly, finally got it to work as expected, then starting un-tweaking it to
    see what part broke it.  Now I am certain I have the code back to the same as
    it was before my last post, and it still works. Go figure.
