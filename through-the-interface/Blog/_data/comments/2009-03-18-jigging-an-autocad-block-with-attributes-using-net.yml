  body: "Hallo Kean\nthank you for these great posts. it helped me a lot. But I have\
    \ one question left. Maybe you could point me into the right direction.\n\nI noticed\
    \ a difference between inserting a dynamic block through the jig and through the\
    \ \"SendStringToExecute\"-Method. While inserting a dynamic block through the\
    \ \"SendStringToExectute\" -method, when i have to chose the insertion point,\
    \ with having the block-preview on the cursor, I  am able to press the control-key\
    \ to cycle through all the grip points of the block, also the block itself aligns\
    \ to lines etc. And at last I can end the insertion command with a mouse-right-click.\
    \ \n\nSo the question is: Is there a possibility to adopt this insertion behavior\
    \ for the jig insertion?\n\nThanks.\nThomas"

  body: 'Hi Thomas,


    I believe this is all possible for you to implement using a standard Jig, but
    to get parity with the standard INSERT capabilities it may prove to be a lot of
    work (and if that''s what you want calling INSERT is probably the simplest approach).


    A Jig is good if you want to streamline or simplify the insertion process.

    I think the most important advantage of jigs is that the application is always
    synchronized. When i call the insert command, i have to deal with events like
    "CommandEnded" which makes the code really ugly.

    Anyway if find a little time, i''ll try ti improve the jigs i already have.'

  body: 'Hi Kean,


    After some time without commentting on you blog, I''m having a doubt. I was trying
    to use multiple entities Jig, base on the code of the link :

    <a href="http://cupocadnet.blogspot.com/2009/03/jigging-multiple-entities-with-drawjig.html">http://cupocadnet.blogspot.com/2009/03/jigging-multiple-entities-with-drawjig.html</a>


    The problem I''m facing is: Snap don''t work, and when using zoom in/out (with
    the mouse roller/scroll), the basepoint loses precision.


    Is there eny limitation on DrawJig Method.

    I was thinking about creating a temporary Group to group the entities and after
    that start an EntityJig only with the createds group, but I''m not sure if it
    is the right track to take...


    Thanks for any help and/or idea...

    I''m not sure what you mean about snaps: are you trying to snap to existing geometry
    (which should work) or somehow snap to the geometry being drawn by the jig (which
    shouldn''t, for a DrawJig, at least)?


    Also, I''m afraid I barely have time to help resolve issues with code I''ve posted
    - there''s almost no chance of me finding time to help with issues related to

    The problem with the snaps occurs with an existing geometry... The snap symbols
    appears, but at the mouse-button click, the acquired point is not the pretended
    snap, but the "mouse over" coordinate.


    I didn''t meant you to support other guy''s blog.. sorry about that..

  body: 'Kean,


    I''ve found a solution.

    - The loose of precision occurs (probably) because of the various Entity.TransformBy(Matrix.Displacement)...
    I think that is bacause of a numeric imprecision, or maybe, some kind of delay/lag
    on the operations.

    - The "snap" didn''t work because after the (PromptResult == OK) there was no
    "Entity.TransformBy(Matrix)" to the last point, because this transformation occurs
    in the WorldDraw method.


    My approach to solve both problems was clonning each entity in the WorldDraw method
    in each pass, and apply the transformation from a basePoint to the actualPoint.

    In the Drag function, on the (PromptResult==OK), I did the same, but with the
    original Entities from the basePoint to the last or selected point.


    It works now... maybe there is some better solution, but for now, I''m happy...
    =)

  body: Nope. I did not yet, but I am going to do it in the next few days. I am sure
    it will work, because there are some big dynamic objects from syscad that are
    stretchable/editable in the same visualized way - jig-like - and have lots of
    dynamic dimensions that change through the whole object when you stretch just
    one point of it while refreshing the graphical representation constantly. My goal
    is to fully understand the jig and dynamic dimensions and then do it. I will paste
    all the code here when I am ready. Your blog, links, videos, articles are really
    helpful - Thank you.

    This particular post relates fairly specifically to jigging: the main point is
    that you need to add the block to the database for the jigging operation to work.


    It''s possible that SetAttributeFromBlock() might also have been used to help
    with this particular case, to set up the block prior to jigging: the code was
    provided by Philippe, so I''d have to ask him (and it was some time ago), or spend
    some time looking into it myself.


    It sounds like what you have is working well for your purposes. Although perhaps
    I''ve missed the point?
