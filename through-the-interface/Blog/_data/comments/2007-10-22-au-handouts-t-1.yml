    Thanks for the prompt reply. Below is extra info in case you hear something.

    On Vista 64 I have been unable to add the control:

    1. DWGVIEWRCtrl is not listed in the COM Components tab or .Net Components tab.

    2. Using Browse to select the DWG True View 2009 control results in message: "Self-registration
    for C:\Program Files\DWG TrueView 2009\AcCtrl.dll failed"


    DWG True View 2009 (x64) is installed and working ok.

    Windows 7 (x64) has reached consumer level so I guess we will all be hitting 64-bit
    OS IDE soon. Thanks again, Dale'

  body: 'Hi Kean, I have a resolution from ADN support that other readers of your
    blog might find helpful. Quote from Marat:"Visual Studio can''t place 64-bit controls
    on forms simply because Visual Studio is a 32-bit application.

    In other words, it is not possible to place the DWG True View ActiveX 64-bit control
    in a form at the design time.

    A solution is to add the 64-bit ActiveX control to the .NET form at run time."
    He sent a C# sample and I have built a vb.net TrueView sample if anyone needs.

    I''m trying since monday to embed the dwg trueviewer in a simple webpage.


    I''ve searched hard on the internet and the only thing I really found was this
    link.


    I''m really lost...

    Here''s the code I used, but it''s not working properly, only a blankpage apears
    with a black border:


    <object id="dwgViewerCtrl" classid="clsid:6C7DC044-FB1E-4140-9223-052E5ABE7D24"
    height="100%" width="100%" data="DATA:application/x-oleobject;BASE64,RMB9bB77QEGSIwUuWr59JAAHAAARTAAArjAAAA==">


    <param name="src" value="http://localhost/Office.dwg">

    </object>


    I''ve tested also src with "C:\...\...\Office.dwg"


    Nothing.


    Do you have the html-code, not only a fragment?


    thanks in advance!
