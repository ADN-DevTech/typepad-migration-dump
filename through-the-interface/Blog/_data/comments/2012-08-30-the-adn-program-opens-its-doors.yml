  body: 'You should add in "Free access to theswamp.org" as well as "free access to
    Kean and Preston''s blog". Both are more useful than the kb in my experience.


    Autodesk has always had the option to participate more in the DG''s, and they
    would have to to make up for the experienced users that stopped following posts
    when NNTP was cut. Exposing the kb is useful, but you really feel this qualifies
    as a new ADN mebership level? I was thinking the personal help, and access to
    seats of acad for dev use, were the main things that made ADN ADN. Sorry for the
    downer post, but the people who develop on acad are not that interested in the
    marketing of things we kind of already have.'

  body: 'James,


    This is not about rebranding "what you already have": this is explaining how Autodesk
    is very deliberately investing resources in helping a different segment of our
    development community. Listing "free access to The Swamp" wouldn''t be very fair
    as it''s not something we''re providing ourselves (although I do expect you to
    see more of a presence from Autodesk there than before).


    We are investing significant resources in posting on the DevBlog (which has Stephen''s
    whole team behind it - not just himself) and providing support via the online
    forums. And much of the content you''re seeing on the DevBlog is KB content, of
    course. If you look back 7 years or so - before we started our public developer
    blogs, such as this one - ADN had a very different resource allocation model.
    The shift to "free" started with the launch of this blog and the publication of
    recorded webcasts and DevTVs, and gathered momentum with "Plugin of the Month"
    and "My First Plugin" and now dedicated forum support. The way ADN allocates resources
    today is radically different from even 5 years ago.


    People place different values on different benefits they get from ADN. If you
    value development software and direct support highly, then ADN Standard or Professional
    will continue to be your best option.

  body: 'On reading your post title and introduction, I was very pleasantly surprised.
    I was hoping for a significant move towards restoring the free access to developer
    resources that once existed in the days when Autodesk used to boast about having
    3,500 development "partners".


    The more I read your post, the more I was baffled. "Where''s the beef?", I thought.
    By the time I got to the end, I was unable to work out any difference between
    an ADN Open member and not being one. Clicking on the link to the ADN Open site,
    the reason became clear; there is no difference because there is no membership.


    Don''t get me wrong, I applaud the move towards putting more information out there
    and greater Autodesk participation in public blogs and forums. Great to see. Well
    done, Autodesk. There should be more of it in non-developer areas, too.


    But to me, this ADN Open announcement looks *exactly* like rebranding what we
    already have. James is right. Spin like this is pointless and even counterproductive
    among the kind of people it''s aimed at. Nobody intelligent enough to do CAD development
    work is likely to miss the lack of substance.'

  body: 'I think the misconception may be in the intended target audience for this
    program. People who are currently doing CAD development on a budget - and don''t
    see the value in paying for ADN to get development licenses and direct support
    - aren''t getting anything "additional", as such: just a much greater investment
    from Autodesk. Which is – as you’ve agreed – important.


    But this is not really about existing developers, as much as it is about the next
    generation of developers who are starting to do CAD-focused development (such
    as those working on mobile products, for instance). They are very often cost-sensitive
    and this new "membership tier" (for want of a better description) helps make it
    crystal clear that you can develop with Autodesk software without any up-front
    cost (other than the software, although this model is likely to be different with
    non-desktop software). Which is, in itself, a helpful clarification: I''ve heard
    it said many, many times over the years that you need to be an ADN member to develop
    with Autodesk software, which isn''t true: all our SDKs are available for free*.

  body: 'I would agree you don;t need to be an ADN member to develop, and I did so
    for many years. The adesk DG''s and books out there were great. The single most
    signifigant change that would have made ADN more necessary was the degredation
    of the DG by the web-only interface we deal with now. It is impossible to do the
    basics of following replies in a thread. I have tried the liear and tree format
    and both seriously stink. The stink by your standards and anyone who experienced
    NNTP using outlook express or forte agent, and others. We are talking about the
    key portal to the info you advertise. I would suggest the first thing you could
    do to back up the claim that adesk is participating in the DG''s more, is to read
    the posts here:

    <a href="http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/Autodesk-Discussion-Groups/bd-p/3011">http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/Autodesk-Discussion-Groups/bd-p/3011</a>

    and get ahold of Eric Wright, and get the format efficient again. At a minimum,
    the headers should be one line per each, and have + signs to expand and see replies.
    One header per line, its just common sense and adesk has been educated on the
    issue many times. This would be a huge win-win as both sides need better reading
    abilities than offered. We are already giving up "off-line" reading, so revising
    the interface is really only half the battle. If I missed some better way to view
    the posts, let me know.

  body: 'I think this is great. I''ve been wanting more developer content for years.
    DevBlog is a great start. The discussion groups have been a tremendous help and
    it''s good to see "Autodesk people" participating more there.

    I too am a little puzzled by calling it an Open Membership where there is no advantage
    of being a "member" vs. being a person looking at the content.

    Maybe I''ve been a member of the "Autodesk Developer Network" all along by virtue
    of my reading and participating in the discussions. I just didn''t know it!


    The membership thing is semantics as far as I can see. The real important thing
    is that developers are getting more.


    For what it''s worth I am an ADN member. (the paying kind)'

  body: As I've been doing development based on free APIs in Autodesk products for
    about a quarter of a century, this availability doesn't exactly come as a surprise
    to me. Sorry, I'm still not seeing anything other than empty marketing and rebranding-of-nothing-much
    here.

  body: 'You''re entitled to your opinion, of course (one I happen to respect a great
    deal).


    To summarise the way I see this: it''s about communicating a shift in resource
    allocation away from a "costly" (in quotes because most ADN members tell us they
    value their membership highly) program to one that people can easily use to get
    started working with our technology when in a cost-sensitive environment.


    Focusing a significant amount of the ADN team''s resource on purely public activities
    (primarily blog posting & forum support, but also other types of content) seems
    worthy of updated messaging - I personally see this rebranding as being far from
    empty.


    As you say, you started developing 25 years ago when Autodesk had a different
    support model for external developers. You probably cut your AutoCAD-development
    teeth getting online help via Compuserve and direct phone support from Autodesk.
    At least that''s what many did, back in the day.


    This is about ADN entering a new phase of its existence, recognising the need
    for Autodesk to invest and provide a broad-based, scalable program that meets
    the needs of the next generation of innovators working with our software.

    P.S. It may be easier to dismiss this tier because it''s available for everyone
    without the need to register. But I fully expect that we''d have heard far more
    complaints from people if we''d imposed registration on people. This is not about
    being able to claim a broader base of developers: this is really about getting
    help to people in the most effective way, without putting up unnecessary hurdles.'

  body: I guess our comments show how well Autodesk has done, and is doing at letting
    us get at development resources without an extra fee. Is there a chance you could
    do a video on how you would research a technical issue? I have seen so many web
    pages by autodesk now, I wonder if I have misunderstood any transitions. I know
    the DG pages, and the ADN knowledgebase link, but no other adesk ones besides
    blogs. I feel like the ADN kb is the least useful. A support case with one on
    one help is always super useful though...thanks

    I''m claiming guruhood here; you''re 100 times the developer that I will ever

    I get the point. Things have changed somewhat. Autodesk wants to point that out.
    Fine. We''ll just have to agree to disagree about the accuracy/honesty level of
    this particular way of getting the message across.


    I don''t see the registration/non-registration thing as greatly significant, but
    it does clash with the language about "membership". You still need to provide
    all your details to download the ARX API anyway.'

    True enough, although I''ve never known that information to be used for anything.
    I didn''t even think about that, to be honest.


    An interesting side note: the ADN tells me they''ll be launching an additional
    "membership" benefit which I expect will help make this feel more like one (it
    will certainly provide a 2-way communication channel, which will be very helpful).
    No doubt implemented via existing social media infrastructure (such as a Facebook
    page).


    It should complement existing blog-related communication (which is primarily technical)
    with more program-/event-/business-related communication (ADN members currently
    receive this via the DevNews newsletter).

    I mostly agree with James Meading that ADN Open is something we already had, but
    I think that using a more fine grained membership scheme would be well received,
    as the jump from Open to payed ADN membership is too long. Perhaps some symbolic
    payment (in the $50-$100 range) with granted access to beta software and some
    other service from ADN may deserve a shoot.'

  body: 'Gaston - good feedback!  We (Autodesk) are still considering what more support
    we might offer "start-up" developers using ADN Open tools (forums, blogs, etc)to
    bootstrap their building a new business.  Anyone can request beta access today
    (yes not quite as good as a paid ADN membership where you are  100% assured of
    beta access).  The tricky part is some benefits require us knowing a lot more
    about a developer - so opening DevDays to ADN Open users would require they sign
    an NDA - and us do a little vetting of who they are.  Maybe making a limited duration
    license of desktop products available - say a year instead of the current 30 day
    grace period?  Again would really require us to get more information from the
    developer so we know they are a developer and not someone looking for free design
    software for a year.  A lower cost ADN membership?  I recall we had a $500 ADN
    membership ten years back.  All things we/I am considering.


    I do feel a little "unfairly picked on" because we phased in delivery of ADN Open
    benefits (moderated forum where we are committed to answer all questions, DevBlogs
    that now have several hundred FAQS that used to be only available to paid ADN
    members, My First Plug-In API learning modules and more) over several months.
    If we had announced the coming future development support improvements under the
    ADN Open brand before we delivered the new benefits, would you think differently?  We
    started delivering before we announced ADN Open to insure we could meet our commitments.  Sigh.


    In any case, I appreciate your ongoing support, interest and investments in Autodesk
    technology!  Autodesk would not be in the strong position it is without you and
    many others support/commitment.'

    this announcement. However, there''s nothing unfair about the criticism of this
    marketing method. Even if it were all delivered and announced on the same day,
    I would have still found "ADN Open" a somewhat misleading name.


    I suspect the same goes for anyone who remembers the cost going up from $0 to
    $500+ when the third party developer program was renamed to ADN. If you make an
    announcement with a name change that implies the cost of ADN membership is going
    back down from $1400+ to $0, and then people find out that''s not really happening,
    you should expect some disappointment to be expressed.


    I guess people will get used to the name, as they have got used to others. Autodesk
    University? Worthy as it is, AU is not actually a university, strangely enough.
    AutoCAD WS? Useful to some, but not actually AutoCAD, strangely enough. ADN Open?
