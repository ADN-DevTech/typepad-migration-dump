  body: 'I''m no 64-bit expert - I''m still working on a 32-bit OS - but I imagine
    you have a 32-bit component (built using VB6) that you''re trying to load into

    You''ll probably need to rebuild your VB6 for a 64-bit system.

  body: 'Hi Kean,

    I am getting ready to start what will likely be a long project, sorting through
    my companies Lisp directory and determining what is useful and what is not.(there
    are almost 500 files in there that date back to 1986, and though I have been here
    for 11 years, even I don''t know what all of them do.)


    I figure while I am doing that, I will likely find some things I would transfer
    into one of our .NET projects as LispFunctions and I was wondering...  I''ve looked
    everywhere I can think to look, and I don''t have any reference that tells me
    where you got those 5000 series TypeCodes.  Actually, I can''t find any list of
    type codes that goes beyond the 1000 series Xdata codes.


    Beyond knowing where to find them, I was also wondering the significance of using
    them as opposed to the standard set of codes.'

  body: 'Hello Kean,

    I currently use "objAcadDoc.SendCommand(stringLISP)" or

    "objDoc.SendStringToExecute("_commandLISP ", true, false, false)" to register
    an lisp expression. But the first way use COM (is slow) and the second way is
    Asyncrono (only execute in the end of command).

    How can I send to AutoCAD a lisp expression, without using COM or ASYNC metodes?'

    These are the two recommended ways - I tend to use SendStringToExecute() with
    a continuation command.


    But please do ask ADN - someone in my team may have a better approach for you.
