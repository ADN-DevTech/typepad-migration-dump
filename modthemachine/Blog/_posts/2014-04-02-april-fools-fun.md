<p>Yesterday, several of us working with the various Autodesk API’s here at Autodesk created April Fools posts as part of a friendly competition.&#0160; I hope no one took my <a href="http://modthemachine.typepad.com/my_weblog/2014/04/new-age-of-cad-interaction.html">post from yesterday</a> seriously.&#0160; You can read a bit more about it and read the other posts here: <a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/autocad/2014/04/feeling-foolish.html">http://adndevblog.typepad.com/autocad/2014/04/feeling-foolish.html</a>.</p>
