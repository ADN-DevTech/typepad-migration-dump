<p>Here are a couple of items that are completely off-topic but hopefully a few of you might find them interesting.</p>
<p>The first item is some software I discovered this past summer for creating slide shows.&#0160; I wasn’t happy with the software that I had for creating slide shows of vacation pictures.&#0160; I searched for a commercial product but still didn’t find what I was looking for at a reasonable price.&#0160; Finally I found an article that mentioned Microsoft’s Photo Story.&#0160; It seemed to have what I was looking for and the price couldn’t be beat since it’s a free download.&#0160; Click the picture below to see a small sample I put together using pictures from a backpacking trip this summer in Olympic National Park.&#0160; (I was trying to keep the final size small for download and chose a video quality that isn’t that great but you can get an idea of what the software does.)</p>

<p>The output from PhotoStory is a wmv file so you can use it as input to Windows Movie Maker or any other video editing software and combine your photos with other video into a larger video.</p>
<p>There are a few features I wish Photo Story had but for the price I can live with it’s limitations.&#0160; Here’s a link to the Microsoft site that describes <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/using/digitalphotography/photostory/default.mspx" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Photo Story 3</a> and points you to the download.&#0160; By the way I highly recommend visiting the park some day too.</p>
<p>The other item I want to tell you about is that Autodesk is selling left-over bags from AU.&#0160; Every bag is unique because the center panel is made from left over vinyl banners from previous events.&#0160; Out of all of the bags from previous AU’s, this is my personal favorite for usability.</p>
