<p>You have one more week to submit your proposals for this years Autodesk University.&#0160; They’re due May 14th.&#0160; I’ve been dragging my feet and just submitted mine this morning.&#0160; More information is available at the <a href="http://www.autodeskevents.com/au2010/?event=speaker.call">Call for Proposals site</a>.&#0160; Hopefully I’ll see you in Las Vegas this November, either as a speaker or an attendee.</p>
