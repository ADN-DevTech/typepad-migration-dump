<p>This week has been busy and left me with little time to work on finishing up some posts I’ve been working on.&#160; Here’s a quick tip that can make coding in VBA or VB6 a little easier.&#160; Maybe you already know about it, but it’s something I didn’t learn about until I had been using VBA and VB6 for several years.</p>  <p>When you’re entering code in a VBA code window you get Intellisense help when accessing methods and properties on objects.&#160; VB.Net uses intellisense to help you when typing variable names.&#160; You can also get help with variable names in VBA, it’s just not automatic like it is in VB.Net.&#160; When you’ve typed the first few characters of a variable, press ctrl-space and the intellisense window will display showing you the available variable names that match the characters you’ve typed in so far.&#160; You can continue typing to narrow down the list or choose one from the list.&#160; Once you’ve selected one from the list by clicking with the mouse or using the arrow keys, press the tab key to use it.&#160; An example of its use is shown below.</p>  <p><a href="http://modthemachine.typepad.com/.a/6a00e553fcbfc688340120a9774170970b-pi"><img title="VBAIntellisense" style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; display: inline; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="292" alt="VBAIntellisense" src="/assets/image_982900.jpg" width="471" border="0" /></a> </p>  <p>The written description makes it sound like a bit difficult to use with a lot of steps&#160; but it quickly became second nature for me and has saved me a lot of typing.</p>
