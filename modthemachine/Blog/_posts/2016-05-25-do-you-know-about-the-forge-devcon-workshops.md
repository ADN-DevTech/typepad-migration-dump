<p>The <a href="http://forge.autodesk.com/conference/">Forge Devcon</a> is quickly approaching on June 15-16.&#0160; However, the day before on June 14, there are some workshops that you’re invited to.&#0160; That fact that there are some workshops is a bit hidden on the website so I wanted to point them out so that if you’re coming to conference you can schedule an extra day before the conference begins and attend.&#0160; The best place to learn more about the workshops is on the <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/pre-forge-devcon-workshops-june-14-2016-tickets-25100444104">registration site</a>.&#0160; The workshops are free but you need to register because there is limited room.</p>
<p>Here’s a quick overview of the topics that will be covered, and the schedule:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Model Derivative and Viewing API Workshop - 10am-4pm.</strong></p>
<p>In this workshop, you will work through a tutorial of the basic steps you need to display a 2D or 3D design on your webpage. The basic tutorial will take approximately 2 hours, the remainder of the time will be spent expanding your knowledge of these&#0160; APIs by either working on your own project or working on one of our preset challenges – with help from the instructors.</p>
<p><strong>Fusion 360 Client API Workshop - 10am-4pm</strong></p>
<p>In this workshop, you will learn the APIs and basic steps needed to create your first Fusion 360 API in the language of your choice (JavaScript, Python or C++). The basic tutorial will take approximately 2 hours. The remainder of the time will be spent expanding your knowledge of the Fusion 360 APIs by either working through one or more advanced tutorials or samples or working on your own project– with help from the instructors.</p>
