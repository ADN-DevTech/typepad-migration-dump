<p><strong>IdeaStation</strong>&#39;s are&#0160;a good idea for tracking wishes. This way people can also see ideas that they too thought of, but did not actually log in the end thinking that not many people would care about them. Now they just have to give a thumbs up :)<br />- <a href="http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/ideas/v2/ideaexchangepage/blog-id/v1232/" target="_self"><strong>Inventor</strong> IdeaStation<br /></a>- <a href="http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/fusion-360-ideastation-request-a/idb-p/125" target="_self"><strong>Fusion</strong> IdeaStation</a></p>
<p>Though they were mainly created for product wishes, I do not see why they could not also be used for <strong>API</strong> wishes - and some people are using them for that already.</p>
<p>If you plan to log there an <strong>API</strong> wish then please use the <strong>API-iLogic</strong> category add a <strong>tag</strong> that would make it easier to track those kinds of wishes: <strong>InventorApi</strong> for <strong>Inventor</strong> <strong>API</strong> wishes, and <strong>FusionApi</strong> for <strong>Fusion</strong> <strong>API</strong> wishes. If it simply has an <strong>API</strong> tag and you click on it then it shows the wishes for all the products.<br />Note: I use <strong>InventorApi</strong> instead of <strong>InventorAPI</strong>, because for some reason the system automatically turns the tag name into that. :-/</p>
<p>I already added those tags to most <strong>API</strong> wishes:<br />- <a href="http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/tag/InventorApi/tg-p" target="_self" title="">http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/tag/InventorApi/tg-p</a><br />- <a href="http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/tag/FusionApi/tg-p/board-id/125" target="_self" title="">http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/tag/FusionApi/tg-p/board-id/125</a>&#0160;</p>
