<p>Service packs for Inventor 2013 and the standalone version of Autodesk® Inventor® View 2013 have recently been released. If you have an application that uses Apprentice on systems without having Inventor installed be sure to have your users get the service pack for the standalone version of Inventor View. Several issues have been addressed that effected Apprentice.</p>
<p>Here is the link to the page where Service Pack 1.1 for the standalone version of Autodesk® Inventor® View 2013 can be downloaded:</p>
