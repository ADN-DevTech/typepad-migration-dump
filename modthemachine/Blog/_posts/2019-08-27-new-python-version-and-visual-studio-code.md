<p>We are upgrading the <a href="https://www.python.org/"><strong>Python</strong></a> version used in <a href="https://www.autodesk.co.uk/products/fusion-360/overview"><strong>Fusion 360</strong></a> to <strong>3.7.3</strong> in the<strong>&#0160;September</strong> release.<br />It could mostly impact <strong>add-ins</strong> written in <strong>Python</strong> where the version of&#0160; <strong>Python</strong> used to <strong>compile</strong> the source code to a *<strong>.pyc</strong> file has been locked down.&#0160;<br />If that is the case then please test your <strong>add-in</strong> once the <strong>September</strong> release is out, and in case of any problems, <strong>recompile</strong> your <strong>add-in</strong> with the <strong>3.7.3 version</strong> of <strong>Python </strong>and upload the new version of your <strong>add-in</strong> to the <strong>App Store</strong>. <br />It might be a good idea to check your <strong>add-in</strong> even if your <strong>Python</strong> source code is <strong>not compiled</strong>. &#0160;</p>
<p>We are also going to replace the editor from <a href="https://www.spyder-ide.org/"><strong>Spyder</strong></a> to <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/"><strong>VSCode</strong></a> in this release. <br />If you&#39;ve done any web development, you might be quite familiar with it already - and hopefully, you like it as well :)</p>
