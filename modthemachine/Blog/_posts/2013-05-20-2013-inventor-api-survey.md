<p>It’s time again for the annual API survey. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Please</span> help us help you by taking a few minutes and filling out the survey. Everyone is welcome to respond. Your answers help us to determine what to work on in upcoming releases of Inventor and help us to justify resources to work on API enhancements. The more responses we get the more we know people care about the API and the more accurate the results will be so we can work on the areas that will best benefit the majority of those using the API.</p>
<p>In question 5 you have a virtual $100 to spend on different API enhancements. Here’s the link to the survey and thank you for taking the time to respond.</p>
