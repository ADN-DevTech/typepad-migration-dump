<p>It’s time again for the annual API survey.&#0160; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Please</span> help us help you by taking a few minutes and filling out the survey.&#0160; Everyone is welcome to respond.&#0160; Your answers help us to determine what to work on in upcoming releases of Inventor and help us to justify resources to work on API enhancements.&#0160; The more responses we get the more we know people care about the API and the more accurate the results will be so we can work on the areas that will best benefit the majority of those using the API.</p>
<p>In question 5 you can choose up to three items that are important to you.&#0160; If only one or two of those items is important to you then only check those one or two item.&#0160; If you only pick one then your full vote will be for that single item.&#0160; If you pick two or three then it is split between those two or three items.</p>
<p>Here’s the link to the survey and thank you for help out and taking the time to respond.</p>
