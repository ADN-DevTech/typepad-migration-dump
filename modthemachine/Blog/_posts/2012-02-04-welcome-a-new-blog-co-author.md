<p>As much as I would like to spend time writing posts for this blog, my other day-to-day work has gotten to be too much for me to be able to regularly write posts.&#0160; I hope things slow down in the future and I’ll be able to get back to contributing more.</p>
<p>In order to keep this blog alive a new author has been recruited.&#0160; I’d like you to meet Wayne Brill.&#0160; Wayne is a member of the Developer Technical Services (DevTech) team which is a part of <a href="http://www.autodesk.com/developer">Autodesk Developer Network</a> (ADN).&#0160; This is the group that supports external developers that are writing applications for Autodesk products.&#0160; Wayne has worked for Autodesk in a technical role for many years. (Last year he celebrated his 20th year at Autodesk). The API&#39;s he supports are Inventor, including iLogic and Engineering to Order (previously known as Intent). Wayne also supports the API&#39;s for AutoCAD, AutoCAD Mechanical and Vault.</p>
<p>Wayne will be posting regularly and will be getting help from some of his colleagues in DevTech.&#0160; I’m sure you’ll appreciate a different perspective on programming Inventor and I’m sure we’ll see some helpful and interesting posts from Wayne.</p>
