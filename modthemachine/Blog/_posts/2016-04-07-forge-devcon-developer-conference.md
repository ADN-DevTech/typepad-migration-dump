<p>The first ever Autodesk Forge Developer Conference will take place in San Francisco on June 15-16. This is a great opportunity to get up to speed with what’s been going on with Fusion and to get a good look at what’s coming with the new Forge platform.&#160; We’ll be talking about a lot of upcoming functionality and will be able to demonstrate some of it. Complete information about the conference is available by clicking the picture below.</p>  <p><a href="http://forge.autodesk.com/conference"><img title="ForgeDevCon" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="ForgeDevCon" src="/assets/image_580706.jpg" width="804" height="195" /></a></p>  <p>We’re still working on the <a href="forge.autodesk.com/tracks-and-speakers">agenda</a> for the conference so check back often for updates. Besides the Forge conference itself, we’re also planning a Fusion API workshop on either the 13th or 14th, so if Fusion is your primary interest you won’t want to miss that.&#160; Keep watching for updates on the website as we firm up details.&#160;&#160; </p>  <p>Early bird registration is due to end on April 15th, so you don't have much time to buy your ticket at the low cost of $499. If you're a student, you can come for free – just sign up for a student ticket using an <em>.edu</em> email address.</p>  <p>The week following the Forge conference we’ll also be holding a <a href="http://autodeskcloudaccelerator.com/">Forge Accelerator</a> in San Francisco.&#160; This is a chance for you to work on your product that uses Forge and get personal assistance from the experts at Autodesk.&#160; See the <a href="http://autodeskcloudaccelerator.com/">website</a> for information about how to apply for the accelerator.</p>  <p>I hope to see you at any or all of the upcoming events.</p>  <p>-Brian</p>
