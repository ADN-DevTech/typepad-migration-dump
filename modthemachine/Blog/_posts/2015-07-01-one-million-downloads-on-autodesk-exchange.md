<p>The <a href="https://apps.exchange.autodesk.com/en">Autodesk Exchange</a> store has now had over one million apps downloaded.&#0160; By chance, the one millionth app happened to be for Inventor.&#0160; You can read more about it and how customers are using the store in the <a href="http://inthefold.autodesk.com/in_the_fold/2015/06/autodesk-exchange-apps-store-reaches-1-million-downloads.html">official announcement</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://apps.exchange.autodesk.com/INVNTOR/en/Home/Index">Inventor store</a> now has 206 apps available.&#0160; With the continued work on Fusion 360 and it’s API, it’s now also feasible to begin writing apps for Fusion.&#0160; The first few are now available on the <a href="https://apps.exchange.autodesk.com/FUSION/en/Home/Index">Fusion 360 store</a>.</p>
<p>Many of these apps have been developed by readers of this blog and I want to thank you for helping to make Autodesk Exchange a success and would like to encourage you to keep creating apps that will help to make Inventor and Fusion 360 customers more successful.</p>
<p>-Brian</p>
