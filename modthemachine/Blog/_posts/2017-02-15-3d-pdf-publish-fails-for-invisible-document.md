<p>When creating a <strong>3D PDF</strong> file for a document, it needs to be <strong>visibly</strong> open inside <strong>Inventor</strong>. This is currently the requirement.</p>
<p>However, you can have an invisible <strong>Inventor</strong> instance doing the <strong>3D PDF</strong> generation, as discussed <a href="http://modthemachine.typepad.com/my_weblog/2017/02/3d-pdf-publish-makes-inventor-visible.html">here</a>.<br />So you could do things that way if you don&#39;t want the document to pop up for the user in the <strong>UI</strong>. &#0160;</p>
