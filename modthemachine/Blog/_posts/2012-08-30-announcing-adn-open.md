<p>There is a new place for anyone who needs to find information about customizing Autodesk products. This new level of free support is called <a href="http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/index?siteID=123112&amp;id=19118898" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ADN Open</a> and will be a great resource for people who can get by without the benefits of a full ADN membership.</p>
<p>You may have already experienced part of ADN Open by visiting one of the DevBlogs, such as this <a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/manufacturing/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">DevBlog</a> that focuses on customizing manufacturing products. Part of the work my team has been doing lately is migrating DevNotes to the DevBlogs. These DevNotes make up a knowledge base of API examples that used to only be available to ADN members. Also all new technical articles that we create will be posted on the DevBlog.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/manufacturing/2012/08/introducing-adn-open.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post</a> by Stephen Preston has more details about ADN Open.&#0160;</p>
