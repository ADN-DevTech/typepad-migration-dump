<p>Buzz Kross kicked off day 2 (Buzz is Autodesk’s Senior Vice President responsible for all of our manufacturing related products). His keynote address outlined the huge successes the company, our partners and our customers have been having – and all this despite the challenging economic climate we’re experiencing. It’s clear that opportunities for manufacturers and for our developer partners operating in this industry abound.</p>
<p>Buzz reinforced our message with Cloud and Mobile – outlining just how important it is for everyone to understand the impact these technologies are already having on the world. There is no doubt the world is changing, and many of our ADN partners are already operating on this emerging and very exciting frontier.</p>
<p>The rest of the day continued with more in-depth presentations on Inventor API, Data Management, our Engineering To Order, ‘ETO’ product, Advanced API and Cloud and Mobile technologies, all mixed in with a lot of wide ranging discussions on technical issues, business &amp; collaboration, and a fair amount of brainstorming.</p>
<p>Now I’m sitting in on the DevLab back at the Lake Oswego office taking a few minutes breather to write up this post in between helping a room full of partners with some detailed and very specific programming problems they’re having. It’s going to be a very busy day! (For those of you who don’t know – the ADN team runs DevLabs as often as possible, and invite anyone along who is working with our APIs, who also needs to spend a bit of time with one of our engineers to work through a coding problem. It’s a great opportunity to get some really good quality ‘face time’ with an expert!).</p>
