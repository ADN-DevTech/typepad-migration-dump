<p>Autodesk University is quickly approaching. Much too quickly if you ask me. I still have a lot of work to be ready for my presentations. If you were looking for some Inventor programming classes and couldn&#39;t find them they&#39;re listed under the &quot;Developer&quot; tract rather than the manufacturing tracts. There&#39;s quite a bit of Inventor programming related content this year. Here are the manufacturing related classes I could find. Let me know if I&#39;ve missed any.&#0160;</p>

<p>I&#39;m teaching the first four classes in the list. The first class is the most basic and would be appropriate for any Inventor user. iProperties and Parameters are used so extensively throughout Inventor that understanding how to access them through a programming interface can provide a lot of opportunities to optimize currently tedious processes.</p>
<p>The second class covers new API functionality in Inventor 2009. It&#39;s most appropriate for those of you that have some previous experience with the API.</p>
<p>The third class is a variation of a class I taught last year that covers how to create add-ins and how you can convert existing VBA macros into add-in commands.</p>
<p>The final class is the most advanced class of the four but newer users of the API should also find it interesting. We&#39;ll look at the internal representation of Inventor sketches, models, and assemblies. Inventor&#39;s user-interface covers all of this up and provides an easy to use interface. In this class we&#39;ll peel off the interface and looks at what&#39;s really there and how you can take advantage of it.</p>
<p>Even though it&#39;s always hectic getting everything ready, I look forward to AU each year. It gives me a chance to meet a lot of you and see what you&#39;re doing and hear a few stories about some triumphs you&#39;ve had with the API, and some of your struggles too. If you&#39;ll be at AU I would love to see what you&#39;ve been working on would be more than happy to help you with any API issues you might currently be struggling with. Don&#39;t hesitate to catch me between classes or email me and we can set up a time to meet. Your feedback is critical for us to correctly prioritize the work we&#39;ll be doing for upcoming releases.&#0160;</p>
<p>On Monday there is another set of meetings at the Autodesk Developer Network Conference. We&#39;ll be discussing what&#39;s coming up in the upcoming release of the various products, including Inventor. If you do much programming you should investigate joining ADN. The API support, events like this, and other benefits can make it well worth it.
