<p>Actually, it’s time for proposals for classes. If you have some cool tips and techniques or an interesting project to share, you should think about submitting a proposal and maybe you can be a presenter as AU this year. As a presenter you get the satisfaction of sharing something that’s important to you with your peers. But you also get an AU event Pass, (conference only; does not include travel or hotel accommodations). And you will also receive a $400 cash honorarium for each additional session they lead.&#0160; You can learn more at the <a href="http://au.autodesk.com/speaker-resource-center/call-for-proposals">”Call for Proposals” AU site</a>.</p>

<p>Whether or not you feel like you’re up to the challenge of presenting, I would love to hear suggestions for topics on classes you would like to see related to both the Inventor and Fusion API’s. Remember, even if you’re unable to attend AU in person, you’re still able to benefit from the content from previous sessions.</p>
