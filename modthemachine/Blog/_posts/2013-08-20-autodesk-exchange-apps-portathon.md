<p>Have you written any add-ins that you think should be on the Autodesk Exchange Store? The Autodesk Exchange Apps Portathon is designed to help you convert your add-ins into Autodesk Exchange Apps quickly and easily.&#0160; The event runs for 48 hours on&#0160; September 13 and 14, 2013.&#0160; Autodesk Exchange Apps has become the number one way for partners and developers to reach Autodesk customers - around the globe and in local languages.&#0160; Over 100 developers working on over 250 apps have already signed up.&#0160; There&#39;s still time to join this coding festival.&#0160;</p>
<p>If you submit your apps by midnight on September 14, 2013 and if they are accepted for publication in the store by October 31, 2013, you will receive US$ 100 per app (for up to 5 apps – US$ 500 total).</p>
