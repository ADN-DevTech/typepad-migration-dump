<p><em>Autodesk Manufacturing DevCamp (June 13-14)!</em></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>Register by April 30<sup>th</sup> to get the $100 early bird discount!</em></span></p>
<p>DevCamps are held every other year where software developers like you can learn to get the most from your time and effort working with Autodesk platform technologies.&#0160; The two industry specific Developer Camps include several tracks catering to the learning needs of beginner and expert software developers – as well as a business track for start-ups looking to develop and leverage their relationship with Autodesk.&#0160; Come to Camp and get two days of face to face learning and help from Autodesk software engineers – the same Autodesk software engineers developing and supporting the Autodesk technology you work with every day.&#0160;</p>
<p>You can also join us for a third day at&#0160; “<a href="http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/item?siteID=123112&amp;id=13713450"><strong>DevLab</strong></a>” where you can work on your hardest coding challenges with an Autodesk software engineer looking over your shoulder giving you immediate help and advice.&#0160; Bring your laptop and work on your code as you’d normally do in your own office – the difference is that you have a team of DevTech experts (the same people who answer your questions through DevHelp Online) available to review your code if you’d like, answer your questions, and make suggestions.&#0160;</p>
<p><strong>Cloud and Mobile Classes</strong></p>
<p>New for this year’s DevCamps are several classes on helping you get started developing apps based on Cloud and Mobile technologies.&#0160; Learn how to build your first Cloud app integrated with your favorite Autodesk product – and how you can make it available “everywhere” through browser and mobile user interfaces.&#0160; Have you been considering building your first app for the iPhone, iPad or Android device but holding back because of fear of lost hours thrashing while learning the new technology?&#0160; DevCamp includes classes that will show you how to quickly and easily create your first “Hello World” app for iOS and Android - with a design and graphics twist.</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p><strong>Class schedule, </strong>June 13-14<strong> (</strong>in Portland Oregon<strong>) </strong></p>
<p>You can attend beginner and expert classes on developing solutions with Autodesk® Inventor® (including Inventor ETO), Autodesk® Vault, Autodesk® Navisworks, Autodesk PLM 360, and several more Autodesk manufacturing technologies.&#0160; Hear from Autodesk’s Manufacturing Leadership including Executive Vice President Robert “Buzz” Kross.&#0160; Learn about new technologies Autodesk is working on from the head of our “Fusion” Product Management Team Kevin Schneider.&#0160;</p>
