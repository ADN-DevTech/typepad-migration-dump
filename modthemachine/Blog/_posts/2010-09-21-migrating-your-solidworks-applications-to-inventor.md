<p>I asked a question in a recent post to see if any of you were interested in a series of posts discussing how to migrate your SolidWorks programs to work with Inventor.&#0160; Well, there was some interest in the topic.&#0160; Rather than break the information up into a series of posts, here’s a document produced by the Autodesk Developer Network (ADN) team that describes some of the differences in the programming interfaces and some hints and tips to help you with the migration.</p>

<p>This is the initial release of the document so it will likely go through some updates.&#0160; Any comments that will help to improve it are welcome.</p>
