<p>A lot of people have been experimenting with the Leap Motion device which allows you to track hand movements and convert that into some type of CAD interaction.&#0160; I did some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWFFnQ3gGwM">experimenting in Inventor</a> and Kean Walmsley posted about some of his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fp9G6hx9Fts">work with AutoCAD</a>. As cool as the Leap Motion device is, it sometimes leaves you wanting for a bit more.</p>
<p><a href="http://modthemachine.typepad.com/.a/6a00e553fcbfc6883401a3fce41af8970b-pi"><img alt="IMG_4299" border="0" height="360" src="/assets/image_82144.jpg" style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="IMG_4299" width="480" /></a></p>
<p>A nice addition is 3D video so instead of trying to understand how your 3D hand motions translate into the flat screen, the CAD model pops out of the screen making it much more intuitive to interact with.</p>
<p><a href="http://modthemachine.typepad.com/.a/6a00e553fcbfc6883401a51193d8b6970c-pi"><img alt="Glasses" border="0" height="277" src="/assets/image_746937.jpg" style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="Glasses" width="480" /></a></p>
<p>Another addition to this mix of technology is a new prototype touch feedback glove.&#0160; This is different than force feedback in that it doesn&#39;t push back but instead just &quot;touches&quot; you.&#0160; Their are a few hundred small magnetically activated pistons at each fingertip.&#0160; They can be programmed to push against your finger at various depths.&#0160; When using the glove you get the feedback that you&#39;re touching something and with the fine granularity of the pistons can even feel the shape of the object.</p>
<p><a href="http://modthemachine.typepad.com/.a/6a00e553fcbfc6883401a51193d8ba970c-pi"><img alt="IMG_4300" border="0" height="360" src="/assets/image_958285.jpg" style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="IMG_4300" width="480" /></a></p>
<p>By combining these three technologies you get a very immersive experience when interacting with your CAD model. The video below shows an early prototype of &quot;grabbing&quot; a bolt in Inventor and inserting it into a hole.</p>
<div class="wlWriterEditableSmartContent" id="scid:5737277B-5D6D-4f48-ABFC-DD9C333F4C5D:6284aff9-8441-4758-93ed-1f63149d15b3" style="float: none; margin: 0px; display: inline; padding: 0px;">
<div><object height="264" width="471"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/dAGtIswrp2E?hl=en&amp;hd=1" /></object></div>
</div>
<p>A future improvement is to add voice recognition. This can especially be useful to activate commands and provide input while one hand is occupied with the touch feedback glove.</p>
