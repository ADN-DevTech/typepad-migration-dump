<p>This has nothing to do with the API but is just something fun that I’ve been able to do with Inventor.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.hoodtocoast.com">Hood to Coast</a> is a large running relay race here in Portland each August that covers almost 200 miles and has over 1000 twelve-member teams.&#0160; You can get a small idea what the race is like from the <a href="http://vimeo.com/9732600">trailer of a documentary</a> that came out a few years ago.</p>
<p>I’ve been on a few teams over the last several years but for the last two years I’ve designed the team T-shirts using Inventor.&#0160; The first one was for an Autodesk sponsored team named “Sole of the Machine”.&#0160; Actually it started out as “Soul of the Machine” but after the foot design we changed the name to match.&#0160; I took advantage of the new T-Spline functionality before it was officially released to design the foot model.&#0160; I also used the ray tracing in Inventor to render the final image.</p>
<p><a href="http://modthemachine.typepad.com/.a/6a00e553fcbfc6883401bb0789ae72970d-pi"><img alt="SoleMachine" border="0" height="512" src="/assets/image_439548.jpg" style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="SoleMachine" width="512" /></a></p>
<p>Here is the final rendering of the model.&#0160; You can click on the image to see a higher resolution picture.</p>

<p>This past August I was back with my usual team and the team name was the “Supersonic Slugs”.&#0160; Here’s the T-Shirt design I modeled this year.&#0160; Again, using T-Splines and the ray tracing in Inventor.</p>
<p><a href="http://modthemachine.typepad.com/.a/6a00e553fcbfc6883401b8d06e997c970c-pi"><img alt="SlugAll" border="0" height="259" src="/assets/image_877815.jpg" style="background-image: none; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin-left: auto; display: block; padding-right: 0px; margin-right: auto; border: 0px;" title="SlugAll" width="450" /></a></p>
<p>Here are larger views of the front and back images and clicking them will open a higher resolution image.</p>
