<p>Cloud Cloud Cloud! Mobile Mobile Mobile!</p>
<p>The message is coming loud and clear that Autodesk is focusing massively on Cloud and Mobile related technologies and the huge opportunities they represent to our customers and partners.</p>
<p>This year’s Manufacturing DevCamp, which is taking place right now near our Manufacturing headquarters in Lake Oswego - Oregon, is dedicating an entire track of 8 sessions to Cloud and Mobile related content and workshops. Our first keynote speech was by Kevin Schneider, the Senior Product line manager Autodesk Fusion who outlined many of the exciting projects we are already engaged with that are taking advantage of these exciting emerging technologies.</p>
<p>Gopinath Taget (our DevTech Cloud and Mobile technical lead) presented a series of tutorials overviewing Cloud technologies, and some examples of Cloud based applications that Autodesk has already pubished on the web!</p>
<p>Philippe Leefsma Demo’d a really cool app he developed that allows Inventor models to be uploaded to a cloud based service, which can then be accessed from mobile phone and tablet devices to review the models. He then went on to present a session outlining all the technical steps he’d been through to get the system working. Amazingly this was all achieved with about 1 months work from a point of absolutely zero knowledge about the Cloud and Mobile specific elements of the project – clearly illustrating just how easy this technology is to learn for anyone with a background in software design.</p>
<p>Adam Nagy then presented a project he’s been working on integrating Navisworks into a Cloud AND Mobile environment, taking advantage of the skills that Philippe had developed. Adam managed to build his project in a matter of days! Just having someone close by who could explain some of the details of this technology made the whole process more than easy – it became almost trivial!</p>
<p>Gary Wassell presented the beginners Inventor API track, which attracted a lot of interest from partners wanting to expand their business into Inventor related opportunities. The popularity of the track was very refreshing, the attendees consisted of both seasoned developers wanting to apply their skills to Inventor development, and also engineers really wanting to explore the opportunities presented by a highly customisable product.</p>
<p>Doug Redmond and Jared Sund presented an entire track on Data and Product Life Cycle Management. PLM360 is a new Cloud based technology from Autodesk, and Jared outlined the technology to a room full of partners who were keen to find out what the technology was all about.</p>
<p>Jim Quanci ran a business development track, helping business owners understand how Autodesk behaves as an entity that many people interact with on both a tactical and strategic basis.</p>
<p>My co-author, Brian Ekins, presented a series of Advanced Inventor API classes discussing Cameras, Proxies, Reference Keys and the Apprentice server APIs. Brian’s classes proved popular and as informative as ever!</p>
<p>The day was finished off with a ‘beer bust’ in the Lake Oswego office, where everyone could chill out, relax, chew over and discuss all of the topics that had been raised during the day.</p>
<p>Day 2 promises to be just as interesting with a Keynote from Buzz Kross, our Manufacturing Senior Vice President, and a continuation of all the classes started on day 1!</p>
