<p>I wish the best for you and your family for the upcoming new year.</p>
<p>For a little fun I wrote a Fusion script in Python that has two options.&#0160; For the first option it creates an extrusion of the words “Happy Holidays” and then creates a box that completely covers the “Happy Holidays” bodies where the bottom of the box is defined by a spline. The box entirely consumes the “Happy Holidays” so nothing is visible in the model at this point.&#0160; The second option modifies the spline points and randomly moves them upwards so the “Happy Holidays” slowly appears.&#0160; After each modification of the spline the program saves the current view as a png file and then I manually used GIMP to create the animated gif you see above.&#0160; Here’s the <a href="http://modthemachine.typepad.com/HappyHolidays.zip">Python script</a> in case you’re interested in how it works.</p>
