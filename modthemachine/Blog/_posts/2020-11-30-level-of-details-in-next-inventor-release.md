<p>As <a href="https://blogs.autodesk.com/inventor/author/garingardiner/">Garin</a> mentioned in <a href="https://blogs.autodesk.com/inventor/2020/11/10/inventor-road-map/">this post</a>, one of the new features the team has been working on is <strong>Model States</strong>.</p>
<p>This might have an effect on some of the <strong>Level Of Details</strong> related functions, events, and properties in the <strong>API</strong>.</p>
<p>If you are using any of those, the best thing to do is join the <a href="https://feedback.autodesk.com/welcome/">beta program</a> where you can find more details about this functionality and can also use <strong>pre-release versions</strong> (alphas and betas) of <strong>Inventor </strong>to test your <strong>add-in</strong>.</p>
