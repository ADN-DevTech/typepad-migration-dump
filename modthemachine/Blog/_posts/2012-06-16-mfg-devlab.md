<p>So we’re just reaching the end of the day, and the end of a very busy week for the ADN team here in Lake Oswego. Proceedings were capped off by the hugely popular DevLab, which appears to have been very productive for everyone that managed to come along.</p>
<p>We were all holed up in the Customer Briefing Center, where laptops, pizza and a lot of coffee were the order of the day!</p>

<p>Several developers were very interested in getting their ideas published as apps in the Inventor and Vault Exchange Stores, it was great to see Gary who manages our DevTech manufacturing workgroup discussing this opportunity with them, and offer hints and tips so they can get published as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>Some developers came along with some long standing issues they’d been having, and went away with big smiles on their faces when our in-house experts could suggest solutions they could try.</p>
<p>There’s no doubt that for many event attendees, the DevLab on its own justified the entire trip to US West Coast.</p>
<p>As for me – I’m looking forward to a road trip to Mt St Helens with Gary and Philippe over the weekend for a bit of fresh air and sunshine!</p>
