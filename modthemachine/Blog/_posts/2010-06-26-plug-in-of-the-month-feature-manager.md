<p>A new plug-in of the month has just been posted at Autodesk Labs.&#160; This one is called Feature Migrator for Inventor.&#160; What it does is transfer assembly features down into the parts they affect.</p>  <p>Philippe Leefsma, one of the engineers that supports members of the Autodesk Developer Network (ADN) wrote this one.&#160; Philippe has put a lot of thought and effort into this application.&#160; Here’s a shot of the browser that’s displayed when you run the application.&#160; It displays the assembly features that are valid for transfer.&#160; This picture shows several of the features selected and the “Send to Parts” option selected.</p>  <p><a href="http://modthemachine.typepad.com/.a/6a00e553fcbfc688340134853f1743970c-pi"><img title="FeatureManager" style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; display: inline; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="513" alt="FeatureManager" src="/assets/image_768003.jpg" width="278" border="0" /></a> </p>  <p>The documentation that comes with the download describes the add-in and its features.&#160; You can download it from here: <a title="http://labs.autodesk.com/utilities/ADN_plugins/" href="http://labs.autodesk.com/utilities/ADN_plugins/">http://labs.autodesk.com/utilities/ADN_plugins/</a></p>
