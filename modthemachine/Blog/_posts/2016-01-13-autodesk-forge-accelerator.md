<p><span style="font-size: large;">At Autodesk University this past December, Autodesk announced the </span><a href="http://forge.autodesk.com/"><span style="font-size: large;">Forge</span></a><span style="font-size: large;"> platform.&#0160; Forge is a set of cloud services, APIs, and SDKs, that allows developers to quickly create the data, apps, experiences, and services that power the future of making things.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">If this sounds interesting to you, the date for our next Autodesk Forge Accelerator has been set (formerly known as the </span><a href="http://autodeskcloudaccelerator.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span style="font-size: large;">Autodesk Cloud Accelerator</span></a><span style="font-size: large;">). The Forge Accelerator will be held in our San Francisco office from March 14th to 18th inclusive. If your application to attend is accepted, you will be invited to spend the week in our office working on your projects that make use of Autodesk Forge APIs - with the help of the </span><a href="http://www.autodesk.com/developers"><span style="font-size: large;">ADN</span></a><span style="font-size: large;"> DevTech team and members of the Autodesk engineering teams. The Autodesk Forge APIs include the View &amp; Data, AutoCAD I/O, BIM 360, ReCap Photo and Fusion 360 APIs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">To apply for this program, you will need to submit a proposal of not more than 2000 words describing the project you&#39;d like to work on and how it will make use of the Autodesk Forge APIs. More information on how to apply is available here - </span><a href="http://autodeskcloudaccelerator.com/apply/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span style="font-size: large;">http://autodeskcloudaccelerator.com/apply/</span></a><span style="font-size: large;">. (Note that this page hasn&#39;t yet been updated to include this latest event - that&#39;s how &#39;hot off the press&#39; this announcement is :-)).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">If your application is successful, we will provide you with accommodation at an Autodesk designated hotel. All other travel and living costs are at your own expense.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">The deadline for submitting proposals is January 31st 2016. It would be great to work with you on your application.</span></p>
