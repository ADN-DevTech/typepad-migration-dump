<p>I have a quick question while I work on finishing up the series of posts on using C# with Inventor’s API.&#0160; Are any of you interested in a series of posts that would discuss porting Solid Works applications you have written to Inventor?&#0160; If you are, you can add a comment to this post.</p>
