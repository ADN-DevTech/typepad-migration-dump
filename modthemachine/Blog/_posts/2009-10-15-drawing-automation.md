<p>I gave a high-level presentation about automating drawings in Inventor at AU 2007.&#160; The most useful information from that presentation is the sample programs, but apparently they aren’t available from the AU website since I’ve had a couple of requests for them recently.&#160; Remember this is from a couple of years ago and Inventor now supports some things that it didn’t then.&#160; Here’s a <a href="http://modthemachine.typepad.com/files/Drawing%20Automation.zip">download</a> that contains the original class handout plus all of the sample programs.</p>
