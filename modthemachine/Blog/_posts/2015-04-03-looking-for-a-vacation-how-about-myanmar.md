<p>This is totally off the topic of the Inventor or Fusion API’s but I wanted to let you know about one of the best vacations I’ve ever had.&#0160; In February of 2014, I spent almost three weeks with my wife touring around Myanmar.&#0160; Myanmar used to be called Burma and is in Southeast Asia bordering Thailand, China, Bangladesh, India, and Laos.</p>
<p><a href="http://modthemachine.typepad.com/.a/6a00e553fcbfc6883401bb0815e77f970d-pi"><img alt="Myanmar" border="0" height="269" src="/assets/image_98042.jpg" style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="Myanmar" width="454" /></a></p>
<p>The country has had an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burma">interesting history</a> and now appears to be emerging from a 50 year military dictatorship although the military still has a lot of control.&#0160; Tourism has just opened up in the past few years and the people there are very happy for people from outside to visit and see their country.&#0160; The people are extremely gracious and interacting with and getting to know some of them was a major highlight of the trip.&#0160;</p>
<p>I planned the trip based on information I got from books, the internet, and a friend who had recently been.&#0160; We traveled on our own and went with a fairly flexible itinerary and adjusted a few things as we went along.&#0160; I put together a video to help remind us of the highlights of the trip but hopefully it lets you see what an interesting country this is.&#0160; I highly recommend a visit.&#0160; There aren’t too many places you can go in the world anymore and not see a McDonalds or Starbucks.</p>
