<p>Just a gentle reminder that time is running out to participate in this years Inventor API Wishlist Survey.&#0160; <strong>The deadline is July 31, 2009.</strong>&#0160; Here’s a link to the survey: <a href="http://www.zoomerang.com/Survey/?p=WEB229EPCV8VA2">Autodesk® Inventor®</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks to those of you that have already taken the time to fill out the survey.&#0160; We’re slightly ahead of the response we had for last years survey.&#0160; This survey is very important to the Inventor engineering team in deciding what will go into the upcoming releases.</p>
<p>Here’s the wishlist that was generated from the survey in 2008.</p>
<ol>
<li>Use Inventor’s functionality through in-process component</li>
<li>VBA Record and Playback</li>
<li>Create Solids and Surfaces by defining geometry and B-Rep</li>
<li>Ability to control Inventor’s progress bar</li>
<li>Support for modeling in sheet metal flat pattern</li>
<li>Full support for assembly feature creation</li>
<li>Creation of all sheet metal features</li>
<li>Creation of other drawing view types</li>
<li>Hole notes, thread notes, and punch notes</li>
<li>Full support for centerlines and center marks</li>
<li>Ability to participate in Inventor’s error reporting mechanism</li>
<li>Creation of ordinate and baseline dimension sets</li>
<li>Support for inspection dimensions</li>
</ol>
<p>Here’s what we did based on this feedback.&#0160; The bold items were completed and work was done on the italicized items.</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Use Inventor’s functionality through in-process component</em></li>
<li>VBA Record and Playback</li>
<li><em>Create Solids and Surfaces by defining geometry and B-Rep</em></li>
