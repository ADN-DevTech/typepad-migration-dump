<p>There have been some big changes recently, and I am no longer working for Autodesk.&#0160; As a result, I want to say goodbye because this will be my last post on Mod the Machine.&#0160; This blog started with my first post almost 10 years ago on August 21, 2008.&#0160; The time has flown since then and I appreciate all the kinds words I&#39;ve gotten from many of you.</p>
<p>I want to say hello because I&#39;m not leaving the CAD world but have started my own consulting and contracting company called <strong><a href="https://ekinssolutions.com/">Ekins Solutions</a></strong>.&#0160; I&#39;m starting my own blog that will continue what Mod the Machine has started. I&#39;ll be creating new content but also updating and re-posting some of my content from Mod the Machine.&#0160; I&#39;m hoping that as an Inventor or Fusion 360 user that it will become one of the places to go for programming help.&#0160; Since it&#39;s my own website it also gives me more control and will allow me a better and easier way to provide some of the utilities I&#39;ve written in the past like <strong>Attribute Manager,</strong> <strong>Sheet Metal Extents</strong>, and <strong>Facet Enabler</strong>. Watch for more utilities to be posted soon, both for Inventor and Fusion 360.</p>
<p>Since I&#39;m my own boss now and can decide for myself what do, it frees me up to provide additional kinds of support that I wasn&#39;t able to do before.&#0160; For example, I&#39;ve been asked to teach API training classes, to go on-site to help with projects, and to write custom software.&#0160; All things that I enjoy doing and would have loved to do but they didn&#39;t fall within my job responsibilities while working at Autodesk and I had to say no.&#0160; I&#39;m hoping those needs are still out there because I&#39;m available now.</p>
<p>You’ll find my blog, utilities, services, and contact info on my new website at <a href="https://ekinssolutions.com/">EkinsSolutions.com</a>.&#0160; Best of luck to all of you in your endeavors with CAD and in your personal lives.</p>
<p>-Brian</p>
