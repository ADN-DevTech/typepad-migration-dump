<p>With Sanjay moving onto another job and also some other additional responsibilities, I’ve been very busy lately.&#0160; Part of the other work I’ve been doing has involved quite a bit of code writing.&#0160; I want to point out a couple of books that I have that I keep going to back to for reference.&#0160; You have to keep in mind that the primary target audience for these books is someone coming from VB6 and moving to VB.Net, which is my background, so I’m not sure how useful all of you will find these, but I found them well worth the money.</p>
<p>I would also like to hear what books you’ve found useful.&#0160; A category of book where I don’t have much experience are those for beginning programmers and would especially like to know if any of you have found books in this category that you would recommend.&#0160; Here are the books I can recommend:</p>
<p><strong>The .NET Languages: A Quick Translation Guide</strong> by Brian Bischof <br />I found this book the most useful when I was first transitioning to VB.Net.&#0160; It lists common functionality in VB6 and compares it with the equivalent functionality in both VB.Net and C#.</p>
<p>Used and new copies are available on Amazon for about $5, including postage.</p>
<p><strong>Programming Microsoft Visual Basic .Net</strong> by Francesco Balena <br />I got my copy of this book in the early days of VB.Net&#0160; There’s been one updated edition since then for VB.Net 2003 but the content still applies.&#0160; It’s a massive book at over 1500 pages and has answered most of my questions when I need to do something in VB.Net that I haven’t done before.&#0160; This is the book that I keep by my keyboard and turn to the most now.</p>
<p>Used copies of this book are also available on Amazon for a good deal.&#0160; The only problem with the used copies is that a lot of them may not come with the included CD.&#0160; I glanced at the CD content when I first got the book but haven’t used it since then so I’m not sure how useful it is, but if you have a choice you just as well get a copy that contains the CD.</p>
