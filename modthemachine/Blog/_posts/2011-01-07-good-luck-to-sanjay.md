<p>It’s been too long since my last posting.&#0160; Things have been busy here at Autodesk with Autodesk University, the ADN DevDays tours, and putting the final touches on the next release of Inventor.&#0160; In the midst of all that Sanjay Ramaswamy, who most of you know, decided to change roles here at Autodesk and has moved into a new position.&#0160; Sanjay and I have been working together as the Inventor API product designers for quite a while and he has been a big part of getting the API where it is today.&#0160; He’s also been very active on the newsgroup and supporting the API.&#0160; I want to thank him for everything he’s done and wish him the best in his new role as a product manager.&#0160; He’ll definitely be missed here.</p>
<p>With the new year and the accompanying resolutions, I’m going to work hard at posting content more regularly on this blog.&#0160; The DevTech team, the guys that support the ADN Developers (<a href="http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/index?siteID=123112&amp;id=723353">Autodesk Developer Network</a>), are going to help me out by writing some content that I’ll be posting occasionally.&#0160; I’ve also received a couple of programs from customers with permission to post them here and will be doing that soon.&#0160; If any of you have found something that you think would be helpful to others and would like to share it, <a href="mailto:brian.ekins%40autodesk.com">email me</a> and we can discuss it.</p>
<p>The best wishes to all of you in this new year.</p>
