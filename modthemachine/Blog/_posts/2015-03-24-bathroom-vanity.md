<p>I previously made a <a href="http://modthemachine.typepad.com/my_weblog/2010/02/woodworking-board-layout.html">post</a> about a some VBA code I had written to help layout the boards from a woodworking project so I could create cut sheets.&#0160; I just looked up that post and couldn’t believe it was almost five years ago.&#0160;</p>
<p>In that post I had an image of a bathroom vanity that I had started to design and used as the example.&#0160; I did complete the design in Inventor and finally finished building it a few months ago.&#0160; Here are some images of the final project.&#0160; Having the CAD model helped a lot in laying out the curved legs and matching the curves on the door and drawer fronts.&#0160; I didn’t do anything in Inventor for the handles but sketched them out and hand carved them.&#0160; These pictures aren’t the greatest, but I’m happy with how it turned out.</p>
