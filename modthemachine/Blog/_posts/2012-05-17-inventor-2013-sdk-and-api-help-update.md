<p>The SDK and API Help that went out with Inventor 2013 were found to have a few issues that we want to correct.&#160; </p>  <p><strong><font size="3">SDK</font></strong>     <br />The initial SDK that was delivered with Inventor 2013 tried to remain compatible with Visual Studio 2008.&#160; However, to best develop for Inventor 2013 you need to be using Visual Studio 2010.&#160; The Add-In wizards provided as part of the SDK have been updated so they now use Visual Studio 2010.&#160; The primary reason for needing Visual Studio 2010 is that Inventor 2013 is now based on .Net Framework 4.&#160; The interop library for Inventor is built with .Net Framework 4 and to use it your project needs to target .Net Framework 4.</p>  <p>As part of this work to update the wizards we also cleaned up their installation.&#160; In previous releases of Inventor you needed to perform two steps to install the wizards.&#160; First you had to install DeveloperTools.msi to install the various samples and programming tools.&#160; Then you needed to install InventorWizards.msi to install the add-in wizards.&#160; This second step is no longer needed as the wizards are now installed as part of the Developer Tools installation.</p>  <p>To use this update you’ll need to download the new DeveloperTools.msi from <a href="http://www.autodesk.com/developinventor">www.autodesk.com/developinventor</a>.&#160; It’s about two-thirds of the way down the page, as shown below.&#160; To use the update, follow the directions as outlined in the picture below.</p>  <p><a href="http://modthemachine.typepad.com/.a/6a00e553fcbfc688340168eb92f974970c-pi"><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="DeveloperToolsUpdate" border="0" alt="DeveloperToolsUpdate" src="/assets/image_764238.jpg" width="490" height="532" /></a></p>  <p><strong><font size="3">API Help       <br /></font></strong>Besides updating the SDK, there have also been some fixes made to the API help.&#160; No big enhancements from what was delivered with Inventor 2013 but a lot of smaller fixes and enhancements, including the “What’s New” section.&#160; You can download the update from the same location as the SDK, <a href="http://www.autodesk.com/developinventor">www.autodesk.com/developinventor</a>.&#160; It’s near the top of the page, along with instructions of where to put the file on your system to replace the original help, as shown below.</p>  <p><a href="http://modthemachine.typepad.com/.a/6a00e553fcbfc688340163059d6058970d-pi"><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="HelpUpdate" border="0" alt="HelpUpdate" src="/assets/image_295903.jpg" width="490" height="251" /></a>&#160; </p>      <p>-Brian</p>
