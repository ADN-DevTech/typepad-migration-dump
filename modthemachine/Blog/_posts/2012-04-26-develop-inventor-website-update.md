<p>Autodesk supports several Developer Center web pages that contain general information about programming the various Autodesk products that support an API.&#0160; With each major release these sites are updated, and occasionally there are updates in between releases.&#0160; The update to Inventor’s Developer Center site for Inventor 2013 is now available.&#0160; See <a href="http://www.autodesk.com/developinventor">http://www.autodesk.com/developinventor</a>.&#0160; You’ll also see links on the left-hand side of the page to the pages of the other Autodesk products.&#0160; These sites aren’t meant to have all the information you’ll ever need but are intended to help get you started programming a product by providing a general overview of the technology and links to existing resources.</p>
