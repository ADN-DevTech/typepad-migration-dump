<p>For those of you on subscription, the Inventor 2011 Subscription Bonus Pack includes API functionality for AEC Exchange.&#0160; (In Inventor it is still referred to as <em>AEC Exchange</em> but the API refers to it as <em>BIM Exchange</em> since it will be called BIM Exchange in the future.)&#0160; The API provides the same functionality that you have through the user-interface; you can define and edit connections, define and edit the definition of a component, and output a component as an .adsk file.</p>
<p>This enhanced functionality is part of the subscription bonus pack, but the API documentation was not updated to reflect this new functionality.&#0160; Below is a link to documentation for the BIM Exchange API.</p>
<p><a href="http://modthemachine.typepad.com/BIMExchangeAPI.pdf">BIM Exchange API Documentation</a></p>
<p>Be sure to read the introduction, particularly if you are using a .Net based language.&#0160; There is also a small sample program at the bottom of the document.</p>
