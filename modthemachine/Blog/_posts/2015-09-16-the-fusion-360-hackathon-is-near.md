<p>One week from today the Fusion 360 Hackathon will start and it will be great if you can join us.&#0160; I’ve <a href="http://modthemachine.typepad.com/my_weblog/2015/08/youre-invited-to-the-fusion-360-hackathon.html">already posted</a> some general information about the Hackathon but if you have any interest at all in Fusion 360 would like to encourage you to sign up by visiting the official <a href="http://fusion360hackathon.com/">Fusion 360 Hackathon</a> site.&#0160;</p>
<p>And for those of you that have signed up and possibly already have been playing with the API, I would love to hear any suggestions about topics you would like to have covered during the training sessions.&#0160; This event is for you and want to spend the time covering topics that will benefit you.</p>
