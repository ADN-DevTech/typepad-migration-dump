<p>I’ve just corrected a problem to the code from my <a href="http://modthemachine.typepad.com/my_weblog/2011/06/stepping-through-the-features-of-a-model.html">previous post</a> for the macro that steps through the features in a part.&#160; It just shows you that I didn’t test if very thoroughly.&#160; The previous version only works on sheet metal parts.&#160; The new version works on regular parts too.&#160; If you already got the code, you just need to download the zip file, unpack it, delete the form from your VBA project, and re-import the form file.</p>
