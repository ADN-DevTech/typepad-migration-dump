<p>It’s time again for the latest API wishlist survey.&#0160; This survey provides an opportunity for us to get some information about who’s using Inventor’s API and what issues you’re having.&#0160; This information is very important in helping us to determine what to spend resources on for the upcoming releases.</p>
<p>Please take the time to think about any issues you’re having with the API; what functionality that you need is missing or what tools or documentation would make your life much easier.&#0160; This years survey is more open than it has been in the past to allow you to describe your specific issues rather than feel limited to choosing from a predefined list.</p>
<p>You can access the survey here: <a href="http://www.zoomerang.com/Survey/WEB22ALQSBG7BT">Autodesk Inventor® Survey</a>.&#0160;</p>
<p>The survey will remain open until <strong>May 30th, 2010</strong>.&#0160; Thanks in advance for your input.</p>
<p>If you use other Autodesk products and their API’s, there are also API surveys for them.&#0160; You can find more info about all the surveys at <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2010/05/api-wishlist-surveys-for-autodesk-products.html#tp">Kean Walmsley’s <em>Through the Interface</em> blog</a>.</p>
