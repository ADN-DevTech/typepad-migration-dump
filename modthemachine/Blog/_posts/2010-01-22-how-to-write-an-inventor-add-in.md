<p>I’ve posted similar material previously but this is more complete and up to date.&#160; The attached paper and code is from a presentation at this past Autodesk University.&#160; I believe the paper can be used by itself and is not dependent on you having been at the presentation.&#160; The primary focus is on someone that’s now using VBA and would like to move to add-ins, although it will also serve as a good general introduction for anyone that wants to learn more about add-ins.</p>  <p>The paper tries to answer the following questions:</p>  <ol>   <li>What is an Add-In?</li>    <li>Why would you want to create an Add-In?</li>    <li>How do you create an Add-In?</li>    <li>How do you convert your VBA macros?</li>    <li>How do you execute an Add-In command?</li>    <li>How do you debug an Add-In?</li>    <li>How do you deploy an Add-In?</li> </ol>  <p>The languages used are VB Express 2008 and Visual Basic from Visual Studio 2008.&#160; It also covers the differences you’ll run into between VBA and VB.Net.</p>  <p><a href="http://modthemachine.typepad.com/files/VBAtoAddIn.pdf">Paper</a>    <br /><a href="http://modthemachine.typepad.com/files/VBA%20to%20Add-In.zip">Sample Files</a></p>
