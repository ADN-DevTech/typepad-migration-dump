<p>This posting isn’t about how to use the API but is an example of what can be done with the API and hopefully is useful to some of you.&#160; A big reason I’m posting it here is that I continue to get requests for the program and this will provide a better way to distribute and update it than the newsgroup.</p>  <p>The program came about after I visited a university a couple of years ago that is using Inventor as part of their engineering program.&#160; In one of their classes the students need to create an Inventor model to fit around a model that’s defined by an OBJ file.&#160; (OBJ and STL files are formats that define a model using a mesh of triangles.)&#160; It was difficult for them to use this data in Inventor and it seemed to me like something could be done to improve the process and it became a pet project of mine.</p>  <p>The Facet Enabler add-in became the result.&#160; It’s an add-in that uses client graphics and client features, plus a lot of code of my own.&#160; It allows you to read in an OBJ or STL file and see it in Inventor.&#160; What you see is just client graphics which means it’s only for display and doesn’t affect the model and can’t be used for other operations like interference checking, measure, etc.&#160; To be able to make use of the mesh data for modeling the add-in supports a command that lets you cut a section through the client graphics, which creates a sketch that can then be cleaned up and used as input for standard Inventor features.</p>  <p>The add-in adds two commands to Inventor.&#160; The first is added to the part environment.&#160; Its icon is the yellow pyramid as shown below (the second to the last command in the panel bar).&#160; If using the ribbon interface it is in the Add-Ins panel of the Part ribbon.&#160; When you read in the OBJ or STL data a new icon is created in the browser to represent the data.&#160; There are also several options to control how it is displayed that are accessed from the context menu, as shown below.&#160; (The “Smooth Shading” option is only available if that information existed in the OBJ file.&#160; It’s never available for STL data.)</p>  <p><a href="http://modthemachine.typepad.com/.a/6a00e553fcbfc68834011571114618970c-pi"><img title="FacetEnablerOptions" style="border-top-width: 0px; display: block; border-left-width: 0px; float: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border-right-width: 0px" height="364" alt="FacetEnablerOptions" src="/assets/image_166634.jpg" width="404" border="0" /></a> </p>  <p>   <br />In the sketch environment there’s one new button that’s added.&#160; It looks like a sectioned pyramid and is the last command in the panel menu below.&#160; It will create sketch geometry that represents a section cut through the faceted model as shown below.&#160; You can use the sketch geometry for standard Inventor modeling.</p>  <p><a href="http://modthemachine.typepad.com/.a/6a00e553fcbfc68834011571114620970c-pi"><img title="FacetEnablerSection" style="border-top-width: 0px; display: block; border-left-width: 0px; float: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border-right-width: 0px" height="364" alt="FacetEnablerSection" src="/assets/image_614935.jpg" width="404" border="0" /></a> </p>  <p>To install the program just download the zip file and run the install program it contains.&#160; It will run with Inventor 2009 and later.</p>  <p><a href="http://modthemachine.typepad.com/files/facetenablersetup.zip">Facet Enabler Install Download</a></p>  <p>Please let me know if you find any problems, have suggestions to improve the program, or want to be notified if there are updates.&#160; I’ll also update this blog post when I update the program.</p>  <p><strong>Revisions</strong>     <br />July 14, 2009 – Initial Post    <br />July 23, 2009 – Posted version 1.5 which contains a fix to correctly handle line continuation characters in OBJ files.</p>
