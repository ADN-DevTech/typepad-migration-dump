<p>We’re still putting the specific details together but I wanted to give some advance warning for a Fusion 360 Hackathon coming up in September.&#0160; This will be an&#0160; online Hackathon that spans several weeks and consists of presentations and lots of online mentoring to help you get your Fusion 360 apps developed and on the <a href="https://apps.exchange.autodesk.com/FUSION/en/Home/Index">Fusion Exchange Store</a>.&#0160; To help encourage you a bit more, if you publish your app on the Exchange store by a defined deadline you’ll get $500.</p>
<p>With the Fusion 360 API supporting add-ins and now with the latest release also supporting C++, and with a $500 incentive, it’s now a great time to begin investigating Fusion to see if Fusion is a viable platform for your app.&#0160; These don’t have to be large full-scale applications but can also be smaller utilities that enhance the use of Fusion 360.</p>
