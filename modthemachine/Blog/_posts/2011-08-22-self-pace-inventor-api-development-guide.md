<p>The Autodesk Developer Network (ADN) has recently released a self-paced guide for Inventor API development called “My First Plug-in”.&#0160; The guide is designed for those of you that are new to programming and doesn’t assume any previous programming experience.&#0160; Most of the content discusses basic programming concepts and then lets you put them into practice utilizing Inventor’s API (Application Programming Interface) to create a simple program to control the display of occurrences within an assembly.</p>
<p>Even for those of you that are experienced Inventor API developers, if you’ve been using VBA this will serve as a good introduction to VB.Net.&#0160; It uses Visual Basic Express, which is available as a free download from Microsoft.</p>
<p>Clicking the picture below will take you to the “My First Plug-In Training” page for Inventor.&#0160; There is also a similar tutorial for Revit.</p>
