<p>The official Inventor API page has been updated with information about Inventor 2010, <a href="http://www.autodesk.com/developinventor">http://www.autodesk.com/developinventor</a>.&#0160; Here are a couple of highlights of what’s available.&#0160;</p>
<ul>
<li>A PowerPoint presentation, along with sample code, that discusses the API enhancements that are in Inventor 2010.&#0160; It was pointed out that the PowerPoint file is in the new pptx format.&#0160; You can download an Office compatibility pack so you can view the new file formats in older versions of office.&#0160; The compatibility pack is available from Microsoft <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=941b3470-3ae9-4aee-8f43-c6bb74cd1466&amp;displaylang=en">here</a>. </li>
<li>The new Object Model chart for Inventor 2010.&#0160; (This is also installed in the Docs directory as part of the Developer Tools in the SDK.) </li>
<li>There is an update for the SDK.&#0160; There were some issues discovered in the wizards and sample programs that have been resolved in this update.&#0160; It’s a complete SDK install so you’ll need to uninstall your existing User Tools or Developer Tools if you have installed them and then install these updates.</li>
</ul>
