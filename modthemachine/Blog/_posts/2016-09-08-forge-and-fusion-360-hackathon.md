<p style="text-align: left">Autodesk is sponsoring another Hackathon this year for the new Forge platform and is also including the Fusion 360 client API.&#0160; The Fusion 360 Hackathon last year resulted in the development of a <a href="https://apps.autodesk.com/FUSION/en/Home/Index">lot of great apps</a>.&#0160; Most of the learning content from that Hackathon is now available on the <a href="https://autodeskfusion360.github.io/">Fusion 360 Github site</a>.&#0160; This year we won’t go into the same detail we did previously on Fusion 360 but there will be one overview seminar on Fusion 360’s API.&#0160; This year Autodesk is still providing the same $500 reward for apps that are submitted to the Autodesk App Store.</p>
<p>Most of the presentations for this Hackathon will be covering the various Forge API’s.&#0160; You don’t have to have an app in mind or even be a developer to participate in or benefit from the Hackathon.&#0160; This is a great chance to just learn in more detail what Forge is and what you can do with it.&#0160; Forge applies to Inventor as much as it does to Fusion 360, so it’s something that Inventor users can benefit by learning about it too.</p>
<p>The Hackathon officially started on Sept. 1, but the first seminar isn’t until Sept. 20 so you haven’t missed anything yet.&#0160; For more information about the Hackathon, including the seminar schedule and the rules for the $500 reward go to the <a href="http://autodeskforge.devpost.com/">Forge Hackathon official website</a>.</p>
