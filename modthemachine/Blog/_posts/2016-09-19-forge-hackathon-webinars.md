<p>I posted about the Forge Hackathon earlier but just want to remind everyone that the webinars begin tomorrow.&#0160; I know the majority of you probably aren&#39;t interested in participating in the hackathon itself but might be curious about what Forge is.&#0160; You can sign up and attend the webinars without participating in the hackathon.</p>
<p>You can learn more about the event at <a href="http://autodeskforge.devpost.com/">http://autodeskforge.devpost.com/</a></p>
<p>And more information specifically about the webinars is at <a href="http://autodeskforge.devpost.com/details/webinars">http://autodeskforge.devpost.com/details/webinars</a></p>
