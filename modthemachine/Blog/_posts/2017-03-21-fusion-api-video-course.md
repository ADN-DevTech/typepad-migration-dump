<p>We’ve been working with the Mechanical Engineering Dept. at Brigham Young University over the past year to develop a video course for the Fusion API.&#0160;Some final work is being done now to publish it live but here&#39;s a&#0160;little teaser from one of the members of the team&#0160;about what to expect.&#0160;I’ll post here when the course becomes available.</p>
