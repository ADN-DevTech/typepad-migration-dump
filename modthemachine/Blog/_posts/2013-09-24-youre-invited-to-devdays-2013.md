<p>What’s DevDays you ask? It’s an event that the Autodesk Developer Network (ADN)team puts together every year to introduce the upcoming product releases and their new API functionality. It consists of presentations, demonstrations, and a chance to ask the experts your questions. In a few cities there are also DevLab’s scheduled which is a full day reserved for you to get 1-on-1 help with your questions about Autodesk’s various API’s.</p>
<p>In the past this event has always been an exclusive event for ADN members but this year it’s being opened up for others to attend. Below are the locations and dates for the sessions. I’ll be attending the conference and the DevLab in Las Vegas in December and would like to meet and see what you’ve been doing with Inventor’s API and help with programming questions you might have.</p>
