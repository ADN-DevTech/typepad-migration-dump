<p>This posting is a little off-topic of the API but I thought I would show you a little of&#0160;how I use Inventor at home.&#0160; I do some woodworking and use Inventor to design my woodworking projects.&#0160; I agonize over the design and&#0160;worry about every cut.&#0160;Being able to&#0160;fully design every piece and see how they&#0160;fit together&#0160;before&#0160;making any saw dust&#0160;is a huge help.&#0160; Here are some pictures of my latest project, a Murphy bed.</p>

<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: left">Inventor worked great for the initial design.&#0160; Where it fell short was in the process of going from that design to a set of working drawings.&#0160; The biggest issue was determining the stock I would need and how to cut the pieces from that stock.&#0160; Admittedly this is mostly a woodworking specific problem and not something Inventor was designed for.&#0160; The method I ended up using was to create an assembly for each type of wood.&#0160; For example, I had one assembly for all 3/4&quot; oak plywood, and another for all 3/4&quot; solid oak.&#0160;In each assembly I have a sketch that contains one or more rectangles that represent the stock.&#0160; I inserted each part into the correct assembly and manually positioned them within the stock. Below is a screen shot of one of these assemblies.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: center"><a href="http://modthemachine.typepad.com/.a/6a00e553fcbfc688340105349de91d970b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false" style="DISPLAY: inline"><img alt="BoardLayout" class="at-xid-6a00e553fcbfc688340105349de91d970b " src="/assets/image_850882.jpg" /></a><br />Laying out the boards on the stock.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: left">I made drawings of these assemblies to use in the shop. These drawings, an assembly drawing containing the parts list and a few more detail drawings, and I was ready to start cutting.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: left">I plan to write an add-in to help automate the stock layout process.&#0160;I have the intial design but it will be a long-term project.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: left">I purchased the bed mechanism and plans from <a href="http://www.rockler.com/product.cfm?page=17212" target="_blank">Rockler Woodworking.</a>&#0160;Their overall design <span id="fck_dom_range_temp_1221239136468_636"></span>is very good and the hardware functions great.&#0160; The goal of their plan was to make a bed that works and the construction being as easy as possible. I didn&#39;t like some of what they did to make the construction easier so I made some changes.&#0160;The majority of the wood in their plan&#0160;is&#0160;just plywood with iron-on edge banding.&#0160; I used solid wood to cover the edges of the sides and made rail and stile panels for the front doors.&#0160; I chose baltic birch for the bed frame and left the edges exposed.&#0160;They also had a lot of screwed butt joints in their design.&#0160;Instead I used a combination of dovetails, biscuits, and pocket screws so none of the fasteners are visible.</p>
