<p>Last week I discovered a couple of eBooks that Microsoft is offering for free to registered users of the Express editions of Visual Basic and C#.&#0160; The free books are provided as pdf files and you can also buy the print versions.&#0160; The books are <strong>Microsoft Visual Basic 2008 Express Edition: Build a Program Now!</strong> and <strong>Microsoft Visual C# 2008 Express Edition: Build a Program Now!</strong>&#0160; Here&#39;s the description from the web site:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This fun and highly visual guide walks you through a complete programming project—a desktop weather-reporting application—from start to finish. You’ll learn how to put the lightweight, easy-to-use tools in Visual Basic Express to work right away—creating, compiling, testing, and delivering your first ready-to-use program. You’ll get expert tips, coaching, and visual examples at each step of the way, along with pointers to additional learning resources.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I downloaded the Visual Basic version and looked at it briefly.&#0160; I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s the best for a brand new programmer but for someone that&#39;s programmed before (VBA or VB 6) but is new to .Net and Visual Studio I think it can be useful as an introduction to those tools and some of the new language features.&#0160; You definitely can&#39;t beat the price.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s the initial link to download it: <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/beginner/default.aspx" title="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/beginner/default.aspx">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/beginner/default.aspx</a>.&#0160; You&#39;ll need to log in to get any further and then look in the lower right-hand corner for a link to the books.</p>
