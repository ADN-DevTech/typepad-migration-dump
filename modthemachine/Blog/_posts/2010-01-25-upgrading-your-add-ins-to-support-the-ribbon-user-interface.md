<p>I thought I should share some more of the work that was done for the last Autodesk University.&#160; This class covered how to upgrade your add-in to use the ribbon user interface.&#160; It was one of the new virtual classes and the video is available.&#160; However, the paper contains all of the information in the video plus some additional material that I didn’t have time for in the video.</p>  <p>The paper answers the following questions:</p>  <ol>   <li>From a user’s perspective, what is the ribbon user interface?</li>    <li>Can my VBA macros work with the ribbon?</li>    <li>Will my existing add-ins work with the ribbon?</li>    <li>How does the API support the ribbon?</li>    <li>What do I need to consider when adding my buttons to the ribbon?</li>    <li>What do I do about the classic interface?</li> </ol>  <p>Below are links to the paper and some sample programs.</p>  <p><a href="http://modthemachine.typepad.com/files/Upgrading%20to%20Ribbon.pdf">Paper</a>    <br /><a href="http://modthemachine.typepad.com/files/Upgrading%20to%20Ribbon%20Samples.zip">Sample Programs</a></p>
