<p>There’s less than a month to go till the Autodesk Manufacturing DevCamp being held in Portland June 13-14.&#0160; A highlight for me is the DevLab on the 15th.&#0160; This is an opportunity for you to bring your code and get one-on-one help.&#0160; I hope to see you at DevCamp, DevLab, or both.&#0160; Here’s the official blurb:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whether you are a beginner interested in getting started extending <strong>Inventor, Inventor ETO, PLM 360 or Vault</strong> through their APIs, or an expert developer looking to gain insights directly from Autodesk Engineers and Product Managers, the Manufacturing DevCamp will get you there.&#0160; There are classes for getting started developing Cloud and Mobile apps too!&#0160; Check out the class offering at <strong><a href="http://tinyurl.com/7zdp77p">http://tinyurl.com/7zdp77p</a></strong></p>
