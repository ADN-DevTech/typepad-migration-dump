<p>Registration is now open for the Manufacturing DevCamp on June 2-4, 2010 in Portland, Oregon.&#0160; You can <a href="https://reg.eegeventdirect.com/index.cfm?event=cms.page&amp;id=SID3FAC7891D004441BB8310C3FCF7DCCB8&amp;token=843039e39a9d9c1243f18011756f3b5052c3">register here</a> and <a href="http://devcamps2010.autodeskevents.net/index.cfm?event=cms.page&amp;id=SIDA5276497014D8474B8D2C27B3BA42307">get more information here</a>. DevCamp is a three-day conference for both beginners and experts interested in learning more about extending the capabilities of Autodesk Inventor through its API. The day before the conference begins and throughout the rest of the week, we’ll also be hosting a DevLab.&#0160; A DevLab This is a great opportunity to bring your project in and get advice on any issues you might be having.&#0160; (<a href="http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/item?siteID=123112&amp;id=13713450">Here’s a more detailed description of what a DevLab is</a>.)</p>

<p>A large portion of the Inventor development team works from an office in Lake Oswego, Oregon, (about 10 miles southwest of Portland).&#0160; This makes it possible for senior management and the Inventor engineering team to participate in the event and provides a great opportunity for you to meet them and discuss your trials and triumphs with Autodesk software.</p>
<p>If you haven’t been to Portland before there’s a lot to see in the area so hopefully you can spare a little more time outside the conference and do some site-seeing.</p>
<p>If any of you are cyclists, the <a href="http://www.pwtc.com/index.php/schedule/more/pioneer_century_june_5_20101/">Pioneer Century</a> ride is on June 5th (the Saturday following the conference) and will let you experience some of Oregon at a more relaxed pace than a car. I’ll be riding the 100 mile option if anyone wants to join in. <br /> <br /><a href="http://modthemachine.typepad.com/.a/6a00e553fcbfc6883401310ff5cea7970c-pi"><img alt="PioneerCentury" border="0" height="337" src="/assets/image_304078.jpg" style="display: inline; border: 0px;" title="PioneerCentury" width="254" /></a></p>
