<p>The Autodesk Developer Network (ADN) group here at Autodesk has just announced a new program to promote the writing and sharing of small utilities to enhance the various Autodesk products.&#0160; Kean Walmsley, who is the manager of the group that supports ADN, describes it in his latest <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2009/07/coming-soon-to-autodesk-labs-plugin-of-the-month.html">blog posting</a>.&#0160; Go check it out and start thinking of what you might be able to do.&#0160; Even if you don’t feel like your programming skills are up to the challenge you could still submit ideas for useful utilities.&#0160; The <a href="http://discussion.autodesk.com/forums/forum.jspa?forumID=120 ">Inventor customization newsgroup</a> will be a good place to do that.</p>
