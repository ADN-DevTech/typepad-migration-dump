<p>This has nothing to do with <strong>Autodesk</strong> software but thought I would write it down at least for my own benefit as I have not seen this solution mentioned anywhere else.</p>
<p>When joining the hotel <strong>WiFi</strong> with my <strong>Mac</strong> I&#39;m not redirected to any webpage, so I cannot log in, which means I don&#39;t have internet access. :(</p>
<p>When I was looking around in the <strong>System Preferences</strong>&#0160;&gt;&gt; <strong>Network</strong> settings to try one of the workarounds of removing <strong>DNS</strong> servers or adding the <strong>google</strong> ones, I saw&#0160;that a <strong>DNS</strong> server has automatically been added.</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://modthemachine.typepad.com/.a/6a00e553fcbfc6883401b8d2425f65970c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false" style="display: inline;"><img alt="NetworkSettings" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00e553fcbfc6883401b8d2425f65970c img-responsive" src="/assets/image_940395.jpg" title="NetworkSettings" /></a></p>
<p>I went to that <strong>IP</strong> address in my browser, and voilà!, the log-in page came up :)&#0160;</p>
<p>Maybe this only works with this specific <strong>WiFi</strong>, but could be a generic solution. In case of many other&#0160;<strong>WiFi&#39;s</strong> the log-in page <strong>IP</strong>&#0160;was simply <strong>192.168.1.1</strong></p>
