<p>Autodesk has a program to help developers working with Autodesk technology called the Autodesk Developer Network (ADN).&#0160; Members of ADN receive access to software, individual support with their problems, and access to exclusive events each year discussing the new features in the upcoming releases.&#0160; You can read more about ADN <a href="http://www.autodesk.com/developers">here</a>.&#0160; In addition to those benefits, members of ADN have access to a large pool of answers to previous common questions.&#0160;</p>
<p>Good news for everyone else is that they’ve decided to make these answers open to everyone and have begun transferring them over into a blog format.&#0160; Answers to new questions will also be posted into the blog.&#0160; You can access this blog at: <a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/manufacturing/">http://adndevblog.typepad.com/manufacturing/</a>.&#0160; You can quickly access the initial welcome page <a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/manufacturing/2012/03/welcome.html">here</a>.</p>
