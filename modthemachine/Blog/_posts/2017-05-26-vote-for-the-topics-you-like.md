<p>I know most of you won’t have an opportunity to attend Autodesk University but you still benefit from the event by having access to the material from previous years.&#0160; You can browser the class papers from previous years at <a href="http://au.autodesk.com/au-online/overview">AU Online</a>.&#0160; Besides the papers, many of the classes were also recorded so you can hear and see what was projected on the screen during the class.</p>
<p>For AU 2017 they’re doing something new and it’s a chance for you to influence what will be presented at Autodesk University which will then be available to you and everyone else after the conference.&#0160; All of the class proposals that have been submitted are now available and can be voted on.&#0160; The voting will be a part of the criteria used in determining which classes will be chosen.&#0160; I was looking through the current voting and was surprised to see a big interest in Factory and CAM related classes.&#0160; You can view and vote on the submissions that look interesting to you <a href="http://au.autodesk.com/speaker-resource-center/call-for-proposals/voting">here</a>.</p>
