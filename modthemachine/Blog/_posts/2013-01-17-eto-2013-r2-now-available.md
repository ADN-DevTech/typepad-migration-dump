<p>The Inventor Engineer-To-Order 2013 release 2 shipped this week and I am excited to started with it. One of the main enhancements is the Visual Studio Add-In called ETO Studio. Using Visual Studio to create Inventor ETO applications will be a nice change for ETO application developers. The previous release did have a preview of ETO Studio but with this release it is ready for “prime time”. I am sure the ability to debug rules will be very welcome. The other main enhancements are quality and performance enhancements. You can download a webcast about what is new in the R2 release from this <a href="http://modthemachine.typepad.com/my_weblog/2013/01/eto-potlatch-recordings.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post</a>.</p>
