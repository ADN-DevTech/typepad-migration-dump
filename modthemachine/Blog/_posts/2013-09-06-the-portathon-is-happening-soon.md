<p>Here’s the latest update on the upcoming Portathon.</p>
<p><strong>App developers can still register and </strong><strong>receive</strong><strong>US$100 per app published!</strong></p>
<p>The 48 hour virtual web based coding event runs through September 13 and 14, 2013.&#0160;&#0160; There&#39;s still time to register and to participate early if you wish.&#0160; You can even submit your apps before the event.&#0160; In fact, over 100 apps have already been submitted for this event.&#0160; If you&#39;re a developer of apps for Autodesk products, there is no better way to reach Autodesk customers worldwide than Autodesk Exchange Apps.&#0160; Customers are active and engaged with Autodesk Exchange Apps as evidenced by comments: &quot;Very grateful for this tool it is saving me a huge amount of time and the tedious task of doing it via the block editor&quot; or &quot;This one is a no-brainer. I have been searching for an app like this. Easy to use, and does what it says.&quot;</p>
<p>Don&#39;t delay - join well over 100 developers in getting the help you may need to get your apps published.&#0160; If you submit your apps by midnight on September 14, 2013 and if they are accepted for publication in the store by October 31, 2013, you will receive US$ 100 per app (for up to 5 apps – US$ 500 total).</p>
