<p>I thought I would share something that I use frequently and have found very useful.&#160; It’s a listing of Inventor’s iProperties and the sets they’re grouped within.&#160; I keep a printout of this at my desk that I refer to frequently when I’m writing programs that use iProperties.&#160; I included a version of this table as part of an earlier <a href="http://modthemachine.typepad.com/my_weblog/2010/02/accessing-iproperties.html">post covering the basics of iProperties</a>, but I find it useful to have a printed version handy that I can quickly refer to.</p>  <p>Here’s the <a href="http://modthemachine.typepad.com/files/iProperyNameTable.pdf">single page pdf file that has the iProperty name table</a>.&#160; Hopefully you’ll find it as useful as I have.</p>
