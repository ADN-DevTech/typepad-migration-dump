<p>The team at Autodesk that supports members of the Autodesk Developer Network (ADN) has begun writing small utilities for the various Autodesk products and are making them available at Autodesk Labs.&#0160; This month introduces the first of these utilities for Inventor.&#0160; It’s a utility to capture screen shots and can be downloaded from <a href="http://labs.autodesk.com/utilities/inventor_screenshot/">here</a>.</p>
<p>It’s an Inventor add-in that was written by Xiaodong Liang and is based on an AutoCAD plugin that Kean Walmsley developed.&#0160; An installer for the utility is provided so you can begin using it now and the source code is also included so it can serve as a programming sample.&#0160; It’s compatible with Inventor 2008 and later.</p>
<p>Once installed you’ll see a Screenshot panel on the Tools tab of the ribbon.&#0160; When you run the Screenshot command the dialog below is displayed, where you can set various options, control what you want to capture, and specify where you want the output.</p>

<p>Here’s an image of my latest at-home project that was captured using the utility.&#0160; You can see the Screenshot command in the ribbon.</p>
