<p>I am really excited about DevCamp next Wednesday and Thursday in Portland Oregon. It will be two days of insightful presentations and a great chance to meet other people who are customizing Autodesk manufacturing products.</p>
<p>I am also looking forward to seeing colleagues from different geos&#0160; flying in from Europe to do their presentations. Other teammates are traveling from California and Michigan. I guess I am one of the lucky ones in that I do not have to travel very far to attend. I will be driving from the Seattle area. (~4Hour drive).</p>
<p>The two presentations I have focus on Inventor ETO and are scheduled for Thursday. On Wednesday I will have time to attend a few other sessions. If I could be in many places at once I would attend them all.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>There will be keynote presentations starting off each day and at past DevCamps these have been my favorite sessions. It is inspiring to hear about what is being planned for the future of Autodesk Manufacturing.</p>
