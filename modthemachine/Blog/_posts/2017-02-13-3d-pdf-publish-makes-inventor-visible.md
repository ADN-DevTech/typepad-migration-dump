<p>A partner reported that when using <strong>Inventor</strong> invisibly in the background to create <strong>3D PDF</strong>, then the <strong>Publish</strong> command of the <strong>3D&#0160;PDF Add-In</strong> causes <strong>Inventor</strong> to become visible :-/</p>
<p>He was kind enough to also check with <a href="http://www.anark.com">Anark</a> (the creator of the <strong>3D PDF Add-In</strong>) about it :) and they said the issue was solved in&#0160;<strong>Inventor 2017 SP1/R2 </strong>and is of course also available in<strong> 2017.3 Update</strong>.</p>
<p>I checked things with&#0160;<a href="https://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/inventor-products/downloads/caas/downloads/content/inventor-2017-r2-update-for-customers-subscription-and-service-pack-1.html">Inventor 2017 SP1/R2</a> and indeed the issue seems to have been solved :)</p>
