<p>I know Adam already posted about Answer Day but I just want to give one more reminder and to let everyone know that API questions are included in this.&#0160; There’s a <a href="http://autode.sk/answerdays">special forum</a> that’s been created just for Answer Day.&#0160; If you go there now it explains about Answer Day but tomorrow it will become active at 6am Pacific time and you’ll be able to start posting questions. Depending on the quantity of new questions coming in there, we’ll also be going back through any open questions on the <a href="http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/inventor-customization/bd-p/120">Inventor Customization Forum</a>.&#0160; It should be a great event and a chance to get over any hurdles on the project you’ve been working on or jump start the project you’ve been wanting to get started.</p>
