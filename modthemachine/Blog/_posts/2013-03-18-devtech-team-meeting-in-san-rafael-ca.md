<p>I work for an organization at Autodesk named Developer Technical services. (We support the Autodesk Developer Network). This last week the DevTech Americas team had a meeting at one of the Autodesk offices in San Rafael California. (Colleagues from Europe and the Media and Entertainment team where there too.) We had one and a half days of presentations. Some of the presentations centered around what we have been doing lately to learn cloud and mobile. My favorite presentation was by Philippe Leefsma on HTML 5. Philippe had many examples of what you can do using this technology. (I really liked the one on voice recognition) He has made several posts recently on the Cloud &amp; Mobile DevBlog such as this one:</p>
<p><a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/cloud_and_mobile/2013/01/first-try-at-windows-8-programming-with-javascript-html5.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">First try at Windows 8 programming with JavaScript &amp; HTML5</a></p>
<p>I thought the presentation by Gopinath Taget on what he has been doing to learn cloud security was also very interesting. He talks about this on the Cloud &amp; Mobile DevBlog as well:</p>

<p>The other presentations were great too. My short presentation was on my experiences getting up to speed on Python.</p>

<p><strong>Fun and Interesting</strong></p>
<p>Monday night we had a DevTech grand prix. (electric Go-Carts) We all tried our best to get to the winners circle but in the end Fenton Webb’s experience with high speed maneuvers allowed him to take the top prize.</p>

<p>Tuesday afternoon we were fortunate to get a tour of the <a href="http://www.calacademy.org/academy/building/sustainable_design/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">California Academy of Sciences</a> building in San Francisco. The building is a great example of how the design of the building effects energy usage.</p>

<p>This is the roof of the museum. The top is six inches of dirt and all of the plants are native to California. The windows open depending on the heat inside.</p>

<p>Team meetings like this are one reason I appreciate working for Autodesk.</p>
