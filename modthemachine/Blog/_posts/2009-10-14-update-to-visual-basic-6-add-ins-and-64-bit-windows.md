<p>I recently made a post discussing the issues around Add-Ins written using Visual Basic 6 and 64-bit Windows.&#160; I made the mistake of not testing it completely before making that post.&#160; Everything in the original posting is correct but it’s incomplete because I hadn’t thought through the registration process.&#160; I’ve update the <a href="http://modthemachine.typepad.com/my_weblog/2009/10/visual-basic-6-add-ins-and-64-bit.html">original post</a> to add more information to cover registering your Add-In on the 64-bit machine.</p>
