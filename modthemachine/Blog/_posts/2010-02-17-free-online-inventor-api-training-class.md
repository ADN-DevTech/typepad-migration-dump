<p>The Autodesk DevTech team (the group that supports the Autodesk Developer Network (ADN)) is presenting a series of online Inventor API classes.&#0160; You don’t need to be a member of ADN to attend.&#0160; These classes will be approx. 1 hour and will be presented each Thursday for 10 weeks.&#0160; The classes begin on Mar. 4th.&#0160; The classes are free but you do need to register.&#0160; The full list of API classes is at:</p>

<p>Look for the class titled <strong>Introductory Inventor API virtual training class </strong>and click the <strong>Register</strong> link to the right.</p>
<p>A different topic will be presented each week with a lab provided at the end that you can work on until the class next week.&#0160; The concepts taught build on each other so you should plan on starting at the beginning and taking the entire series.</p>
<p>The class it being held at a time both those in Europe and in the Americas can attend.&#0160; It will be at 4pm UK time, which is 8am Pacific time (and for a brief time it will be 9am until out daylight saving times sync up).</p>
<p>If you have Inventor, you have the minimum pre-requisites because you have access to Inventor’s VBA that you can use.&#0160; It would be good to have had some experience with VBA or another programming language.&#0160; In addition to VBA it wouldn’t hurt to have a full development environment. If you don’t already have something I would recommend looking into one of the Express Edition languages.&#0160; They’re free and can be downloaded from <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/express/Downloads/">Microsoft’s website</a>.&#0160; Visual Basic 2008 Express Edition will be the easiest to transition to from VBA.</p>
<p>The classes will also be recorded and made available online for those that aren’t able to attend the live class.</p>
