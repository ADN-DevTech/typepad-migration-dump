<p>The 2 day DevCamp offers training for beginners and experts on the APIs of each of the products listed above. You get to talk to Autodesk product management and engineering staff, and to meet fellow developers like you. There is also a Business Development track for those steering their company’s strategic direction and investments as well as Autodesk specific sales and marketing topics.&#0160; Just one of several featured Autodesk management speakers includes Executive Vice President of Autodesk Manufacturing, Robert “Buzz” Kross.</p>
<p>Following on from the DevCamp we are holding a day long DevLab. The DevLab has no agenda as it’s all about spending quality time working with you on your specific needs and challenges. ADN DevTech engineers covering Autodesk technologies – Inventor, AutoCAD Mechanical, Vault and more - are available to help you – 1 to 1. Bring your laptop and work on your code as you’d normally do in your own office. With DevLab you have a team of experts available to review your code, answer your questions, and make suggestions.</p>
<p>CALL TO ACTION – let us know you’re interested!</p>
