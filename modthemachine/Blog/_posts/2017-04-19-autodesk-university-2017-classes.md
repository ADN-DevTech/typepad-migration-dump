<p>The <a href="http://au.autodesk.com/speaker-resource-center/call-for-proposals">call for proposals</a> for classes at this year’s Autodesk University is now open.&#0160; Do you have something interesting you’ve been working on that you’d like to share?&#0160; You definitely won’t get rich teaching classes but there are definitely some benefits to teaching too.&#0160; First, is the opportunity to mix with others with the same interests you have and share your work with them.&#0160; You also get a free AU event Pass, but that is just for the conference and doesn’t include hotel or travel costs.&#0160; If you teach more than one class you get $400 for each additional class.&#0160; The <a href="http://au.autodesk.com/speaker-resource-center/call-for-proposals">AU website</a> has a lot of great information about submitting a proposal.</p>

<p>I know for most of you teaching at AU probably isn’t something you’re that interested in but you do benefit from the classes whether you can attend AU or not by having access to the material after AU.&#0160; Do you have any ideas for classes you would like; particularly any related to the Inventor or Fusion API’s?&#0160; Feel free to comment under this post if you do.&#0160; I know I’m still trying to figure out what to present this year.&#0160; They’ve also introduced a new “<a href="http://au.autodesk.com/speaker-resource-center/call-for-proposals/recommend">Request a Class</a>” option this year if you have ideas on something you’d like to see that’s not related to the API.</p>
