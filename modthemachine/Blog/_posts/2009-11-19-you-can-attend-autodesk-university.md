<p>Have you ever wanted to go to Autodesk University (AU)?&#0160; It’s an annual event, usually in Las Vegas, where you can attend classes to learn how to make better use of your Autodesk software, see the latest hardware and software, and meet with a bunch of other people doing what you do.&#0160; The problem is that it can be expensive and it takes time to go.&#0160; This year they’ve come up with something new so everyone can attend.&#0160; It’s called <em>Autodesk University Virtual</em>.&#0160; With this you can get much of the same content as if you were there but you can stay at home and fit it into your schedule.&#0160;</p>
<p>For AU Virtual, there are two levels of passes; free and premier.&#0160; The premier pass is $99, but is free for subscription customers and also students and educators.&#0160; Rather than list what you get with each pass I’ll point you to the <a href="http://au.autodesk.com/?nd=au_virtual_eight_reasons">AU website</a>.&#0160; The biggest difference is that with the premier pass you can attend over 50 classes that are only accessible through AU Virtual.&#0160; (Even those attending in Las Vegas will have to use AU Virtual to see these classes.)&#0160; The AU Virtual classes are live where you can watch the class and ask questions.&#0160; In addition you will also have access to many of the other presentations that are being presented in Las Vegas that you can view anytime.</p>
<p>I&#39;m presenting one AU Virtual class.&#0160; If you decide to sign up look for the <a href="http://au.autodesk.com/?nd=e_class&amp;session_id=5206&amp;jid=323682"><strong>Upgrading Your Autodesk Inventor Add-Ins to Use the New Ribbon User-Interface</strong></a> class.&#0160; You can watch it at 6:00am and 9:00 am PST on Thursday, Dec. 3rd.&#0160; I’ll be there to answer any questions.</p>
<p>I hope to see you in Las Vegas or online.</p>
