<p>I mentioned before in the <a href="http://modthemachine.typepad.com/my_weblog/2010/02/free-online-inventor-api-training-class.html">previous post</a> about the free online API training class that the material would be posted online.&#0160; The material is currently available as a single <a href="http://download.autodesk.com/media/adn/InventorOnlineAPItraining2010.zip">zip file</a> that contains the videos, slides, and labs for the sessions that have been completed so far.&#0160; This zip file will be added to each week with the material presented during the most recent session.&#0160; The final session is currently scheduled for May 6, 2010.&#0160; If the format or location for this delivery changes, I’ll add a new post describing the changes.</p>
