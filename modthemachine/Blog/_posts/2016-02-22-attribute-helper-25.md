<p>A problem was reported and I’ve made a fix and have created a new version of the Attribute Helper utility.&#0160; If you’re unfamiliar with it, it’s a little utility that lets you create, view, and edit attributes within a document. If you’re relatively new to the Inventor API and are wondering what attributes are, here’s a <a href="http://modthemachine.typepad.com/my_weblog/2009/07/introduction-to-attributes.html">post giving a quick introduction</a>.</p>
<p>If you already have a version of “Attribute Helper” installed, you should first uninstall the version you have, which you can do using the standard Windows uninstall utility where you should see “Attribute Helper” listed as one of the installed programs, as shown below.</p>
<p><a href="http://modthemachine.typepad.com/.a/6a00e553fcbfc6883401b8d146b5ef970c-pi"><img alt="UninstallAttributeHelper" border="0" height="349" src="/assets/image_399286.jpg" title="UninstallAttributeHelper" width="450" /></a></p>
<p>Once it’s uninstalled, you can install the <a href="http://modthemachine.typepad.com/AttributeHelperSetup_2.5.exe">2.5 version of Attribute Helper</a>.&#0160; There is some help documentation delivered with the utility with instructions on how to use it and you can quickly determine if it was installed correctly by checking to see if the Attribute Helper command is now available in the Tools panel when you have a document open.</p>
<p><a href="http://modthemachine.typepad.com/.a/6a00e553fcbfc6883401b8d146b5f3970c-pi"><img alt="AttributeHelperCommand" border="0" height="70" src="/assets/image_464362.jpg" title="AttributeHelperCommand" width="450" /></a></p>
<p>And when you run the Attribute Helper command, you should see the dialog below with the version displayed being “2.5”, as shown below.</p>
