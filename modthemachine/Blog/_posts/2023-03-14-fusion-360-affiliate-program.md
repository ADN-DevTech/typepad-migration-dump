<p><em>Are you a huge fan of Autodesk Fusion 360? Do you have a robust community or following that trusts your opinion on software (and other things)? The Fusion 360 Marketing Team has a lucrative proposal for you: join our affiliate program!</em></p>
<p>Affiliate marketing is a process by which an affiliate earns a commission for selling another company’s products. At Autodesk, potential affiliates apply to our program and, once approved, are given unique links and visuals to use when mentioning our products on their channels. Members receive a commission on every verified sale made through their unique link.</p>
<p><strong>What’s in it for me? </strong></p>
<p>The team at Fusion 360 is looking for passionate community members with a following that would respect their opinion on design and manufacturing software solutions. We think such valuable voices deserve compensation for any sales they help make happen, so we offer a starting commission of 7% on verified digital sales.</p>
<p>The Fusion 360 team is really excited to launch a program that recognizes and rewards our community members in everyone’s favorite way: cash! If you’re interested, please reach out to the Fusion 360 social media manager at <a href="mailto:fusion360affiliateprogram@autodesk.com">fusion360affiliateprogram@autodesk.com</a>, or simply DM us on social media to get in touch.</p>
