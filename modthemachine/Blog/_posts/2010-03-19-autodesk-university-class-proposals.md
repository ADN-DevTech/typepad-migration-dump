<p>The <a href="http://www.autodeskevents.com/au2010/email/CFPInvite/">invitation</a> to submit proposals for this years Autodesk University was sent out earlier this week.&#0160; Do you have a topic you think would be interesting to a lot of other Inventor users?&#0160; Now&#39;s the time to start thinking about it.&#0160; The deadline for proposals is May 14th.</p>
<p>If you don’t have an idea for a class or teaching a class isn’t your thing, what would you like to hear from others?&#0160; Remember that AU isn’t limited to those few that can attend in Las Vegas; there are the new virtual sessions that are available online and the papers from the classes benefit everyone.&#0160; So even if you can’t attend in Las Vegas you should still care about the topics covered.&#0160; If you have any ideas for API specific or general Inventor classes please let me know.&#0160; I’ll pass any ideas onto other experts that might be interested in teaching your suggested classes.&#0160; It’s always difficult to come up with new topics each year so any input is appreciated.</p>
