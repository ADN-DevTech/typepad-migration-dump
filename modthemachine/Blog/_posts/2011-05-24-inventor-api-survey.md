<p>It’s time once again to make your voice heard.&#0160; The annual Inventor API survey has begun and is all about getting your input about what API functionality we should be working on for future Inventor releases.&#0160; The questions this year a little more specific than they’ve been in the past.&#0160; Hopefully, this will help us to be able to more clearly define the areas where there’s the most need.&#0160; If there’s something you need and it’s not listed, please feel free to list it.&#0160; Just click the link below to go to Kean Walmsley’s blog post for the link to survey and more information.</p>
