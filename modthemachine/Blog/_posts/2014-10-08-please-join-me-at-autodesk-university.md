<p>I’ll be at <a href="http://au.autodesk.com/">Autodesk University</a> this year and would love the chance to meet you and see what you’re doing with the various Autodesk API’s and try to help with any questions or problems you’re having. I’ve never talked to anyone that regretted going. You’ll learn a lot from the classes and especially the networking of working with people from Autodesk and fellow customers and developers.&#0160; You can learn more about the benefits and even get some help on convincing your manager how useful it will be at this <a href="http://au.autodesk.com/las-vegas/benefits">link</a>.</p>
<p>Here’s some of what’s happening this year:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://au.autodesk.com/las-vegas/schedule">650 classes</a> for designers and engineers, plus special Monday events and networking receptions</li>
<li><a href="http://au.autodesk.com/plan/keynotes-forums">Exhibit Hall</a> featuring more than 160 Autodesk authorized developers, solution providers, and our trusted partners.</li>
<li><a href="http://au.autodesk.com/plan/keynotes-forums">Innovation forums</a>&#0160; and <a href="http://au.typepad.com/au/2014/06/whats-coming-to-au-2014-more-tailored-experiences-1.html">tailored experiences</a></li>
<li><a href="http://au.autodesk.com/las-vegas/sustainability/contest">Sustainable design contest</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Autodesk University is Dec. 2-4 in Las Vegas.&#0160; On Dec.1st there is also the ADN DevDays conference where you can learn about what’s coming in future releases with a focus on the API’s. If you sign up for AU by Oct. 19th you’ll save $500.</p>
<p>I’ll be presenting at the DevDays conference and will also be teaching two classes at Autodesk University:</p>
