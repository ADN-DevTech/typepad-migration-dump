<p>Autodesk recently finished the first ever Cloud Accelerator where several companies were selected to come into the San Francisco office to work on their applications, which use the Autodesk cloud technology in some way.&#0160; They were able to work directly with the ADN and clout teams to accelerate the development of their applications.&#0160;</p>
<p>The first event was so successful, there has been another one scheduled for June 1-12.&#0160; With the addition of add-ins, it’s now possible to create applications for Fusion and this is a great opportunity for you to quickly get up to speed.&#0160; The deadline for applications is April 19th, so it’s quickly approaching.&#0160; It would be great to work with some Fusion developers during the event.</p>

<p>Here are some highlights from the last event.</p>
