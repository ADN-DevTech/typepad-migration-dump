<p>The ADN team has already started the 2014 series of worldwide ADN conferences. There are presentations at 16 cities around the world beginning now and continuing through January.&#0160;</p>
<p>I’ll be at the DevDays conference the Monday before Autodesk University at Las Vegas and welcome the opportunity to meet you and see what you’ve been working on.&#0160; Besides the event on Monday there is also a DevHack programming workshop on Tuesday from 1:00 pm – 5:30 pm.&#0160; You can spend an afternoon or a few hours getting help with your code or programming with Autodesk staff and fellow ADN members.</p>

<p>The theme this year is <span style="color: #ffc000;"><strong>10x</strong></span></p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>Join us at DevDays 2014 to learn how you can take advantage of new technologies to grow your business reach by a factor of ten.</p>
<p>Our annual DevDays events have always been the best way that our Autodesk Developer Network partners keep up to date with new and upcoming technology and features. This time we&#39;re showing you how to leverage what Autodesk is doing so that you can expand your customer base with new technology and new customers.</p>
<p>If you are serious about developing on Autodesk platform technologies and have not yet attended an Autodesk Developer Network Conference, join us for a deep dive into a whole range of products and services. We&#39;ll be covering Autodesk Cloud and Mobile APIs, including quick reviews of the View and Data API, Fusion 360, BIM 360, Infraworks 360, AutoCAD 360, and AutoCAD Core Engine Services APIs. Of course, we will be covering new features and APIs for our upcoming desktop products too.</p>
<p>DevDays is a traditional road show to 16 cities worldwide for the benefit of members of the Autodesk Developer Network. However, we&#39;re happy to hear from – and help – innovators, forward thinkers and companies just getting started, so even if you are not an ADN member and are interested in this event, we invite you view the information, locations and schedule at <a href="http://www.autodeskdevdays.com/">www.autodeskdevdays.com</a>. ADN members can register via that website. Non-ADN members can contact us at <a href="mailto:devdaysinfo@autodesk.com">devdaysinfo@autodesk.com</a>. Material demonstrated and discussed at DevDays is highly confidential and under Non-disclosure Agreement.</p>
