  body: 'I saw the comment about apprentice accessing documents in vault but did not
    see an answer.


    I have been developing an access solution for our bill of materials and it would
    seem to be a better solution to access through vault rather than local copies
    of the documents?


    Thank you for any insite.

  body: "Great blog, and thanks for the lessons gleaned from it so far.\n\nI have\
    \ been developing data extraction code in a database using Apprentice to read\
    \ the iProperties of IDW's & Inventor DWG's, verify them against the database,\
    \ and then push any necessary corrections back again. \n\nProblem is that when\
    \ the IDW/DWG is opened in Inventor I then have to access the Property Sets and\
    \ read and write each property before it will update on screen. This only seems\
    \ to apply to iProperties that are referenced in the Revision Table. Other properties\
    \ in the title block seem fine.\n\nThe values are saved fine using 'FlushToFile',\
    \ and they appear in the 'Custom' tab in the iProperties dialog once the file\
    \ is reopened in Inventor, but they won't update until I've either manually edited\
    \ one of them in the iProperties dialog and clicked 'Apply', or I've done the\
    \ read/write using this VBA approach:\n\n\nSet invDoc = ThisApplication.ActiveDocument\n\
    Set invPropSets = invDoc.PropertySets\nSet invPropSet = invPropSets.Item(\"Inventor\
    \ User Defined Properties\")\n\nSet invProp = invPropSet.Item(\"REV CHK BY\")\n\
    strTemp = invProp.Value\ninvProp.Value = strTemp\n\n\nAny thoughts please? A blog\
    \ post on the matter perhaps?\n-----"
