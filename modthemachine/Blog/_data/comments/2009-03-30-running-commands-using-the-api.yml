    \ work as described. \nSo I still have to use loop like\n\nDo While ThisApplication.CommandManager.\

    \ Execute2 method specific to Inventor 2010 release?\n\nVladimir"

    I''ve Inventor 2009 and its api also exposes Execute2 method. So it''s not specific
    to 2010.'

  body: 'Hi,

    Use your example PlacePart with command RenameBrowserNodes and pre-setting Default
    Option.


    How I use the kCommandNameEvent and define in the option?

    Call oCommandMgr.PostPrivateEvent(kCommandNameEvent, "Default")'

  body: "Brian,\n\nI have an odd situation.  I'm using the the CommandManager to execute\
    \ an export of a face to get to a pline of the surface's edges in Autocad (which\
    \ is used by a vendor to create an extrusion die).  Here's the applicable portion\
    \ of the code (in c#):\n\n\npartDoc:  previously assigned to the active Part Document.\
    \  \n\ndieProfile:  previously selected by the user via user interactions (type\
    \ Inventor.Face).\n \n\n\npartDoc.SelectSet.Clear();\n            partDoc.SelectSet.Select(dieProfile);\n\
    \ncontrolDef = commandManager.ControlDefinitions[\"GeomToDXFCommand\"];\n controlDef.Execute();\n\
    \n\nThe code above runs correctly when my program runs as an external program\
    \ that hooks into an existing instance of Inventor.  The problem is that whenever\
    \ I convert my program to run as an add-in the exact same code above doesn't appear\
    \ to execute (or at least the export never happens).  Any ideas?\n-----"
