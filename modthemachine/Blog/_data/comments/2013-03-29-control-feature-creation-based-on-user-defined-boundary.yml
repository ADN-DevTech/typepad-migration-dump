  body: "Hello\n\nNice code, but real world would need a bit more.\nWould it be possible\
    \ to use a boundary of e.g. 2 concentric circles, so that the resulting pattern\
    \ would be a \"ring\" of holes? Think of a baseplate that has a cut out and holes\
    \ should only surround it, but not \"touch\" the edge? \nIs it possible to let\
    \ user select the pattern element by using pick-method and let user pick the set\
    \ of areas where pattern elements should not be suppressed?\n\n-----"
