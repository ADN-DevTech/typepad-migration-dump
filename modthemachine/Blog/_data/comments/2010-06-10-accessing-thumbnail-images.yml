  body: 'Hi,

    sorry for my previous post. I installed directly InventorThumbnailView.dll found
    in Release directory. After, I''ve tried to rebuild project and I''ve installed
    resulting dll. This seems to be good. I hope this is helpful.

    Cheers'

  body: As I understand IPTs, IAMs, IDWs etc now use PNG as thumbnail. But I see DWF
    still uses JPG :(

  body: 'InventorThumbnailView.dll


    I am having trouble running an application on Windows 7 x32 and x64 if it runs
    as administrator using the dll.


    I get the error "Could not obtain thumbnail provider...." when running your sample
    "ViewThumgnail"


    Works fine if it isn''t run as admin. My application needs admin.'

  body: I have tested the code that you posted for exporting the sheet metal flat
    pattern and putting edges on specific layers. Do you know if the same can be done
    with sketch lines of an unconsumed sketch in the flat pattern?
