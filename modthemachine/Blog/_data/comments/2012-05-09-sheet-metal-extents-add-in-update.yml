  body: 'Hi Brian,


    It''s great to see that you''ve taken the time to update this add in. I use it
    extensively, it''s a very useful tool.


    My only bug bear is that It occasionally gives an error, but it doesn''t tell
    me which part the error was in.


    There is also no way to turn the error off. This can be very frustrating if the
    error crops up a lot of times in a large assembly - lots of button clicks to clear
    the errors before you can go looking for the cause.


    In the meantime, keep up the good work with ''Mod the machine''.


    Paul.'

    If you run into things like this please let me know.  I did add some more error
    handling with this release where it should gracefully fail without any dialogs.  There
    may be some room for improvement there in the future.

  body: It's not possible to manipulate an Inventor model without having Inventor.  The
    Inventor API can be used from C# but without Inventor you don't have access to
    the API.

  body: Brian, I'm using your original add-in with 2012. Occasionally (usually when
    changing the part sketch) I get the following error "Unexpected error while updating
    the property values with the sheet metal extents. The results should not ne used."
    Any idea's as to how this can be overcome? I'll be upgrading to 2013 in the first
    quarter of next year so your updated version might fix this). I have only seen
    this error since upgrading from 2011 to 2012 PDS.

  body: 'Hi Brian,


    I assume this even if this is a registry-free version, it will still add an entry
    in the Add-ins dialog box (Tools > Options > Add-Ins)?


    I cant seem to get it to work, as no entry appears in my Add-In (even after clicking
    Show hidden members), either through the installer, or drag and drop method.


    I''m using Inventor 2013 from Factory Design Suite.


    Any other checks I can do to make sure it loads? Any re-registration needed?


    Thanks!'

    Its inside the zip file. I placed this in the same folder where the SheetMetalExtents.dll
    is located, ran it, and now it appears in the Add-in Manager'

  body: I also tried to use the "SheetMetalExtentsInstall" thats posted above.  The
    program shows up on my "Programs and features" as version 3.0, but it is not listed
    under Inventor 2013 Add-ins and it doesnt work in 2013.  I also tried adding the
    code in the second zip to the %appdata% folder, but that didnt work either.

    This happens if I edit the sketch of my part.  When I exit the sketch and the
    model updates, it gives me this error and the parameters do not update.  I am
    using Inventor 2013, SP1.1
