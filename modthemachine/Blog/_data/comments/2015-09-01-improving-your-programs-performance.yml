  body: 'In regards to the Application.ScreenUpdating call.  If a program is performing
    a loop of processes in a drawing, some including graphical changes.  Does this
    affect activedocument.update function at all?


    Particularly..The program I have with drawing document open, some iproperty information
    is processed, an image on the document is added or modified, then a copy of the
    modified document is saved creating a new file (save copy as functionality).  This
    can loop for as many times as user needs it too. Constantly modifying the original
    and then saving a new copy until the original is closed (aka - program finishes)  Would
    turning off the ScreenUpdating property affect the overall file output if turned
    off?'

    The only way to know for sure is to try it. :)


    I would expect that the actual drawing data is unaffected by this.  There''s a
    chance that the thumbnail that''s created for the document won''t be up to date.  You
    can also turn the ScreenUpdating off while you do the majority of the processing
    and then turn of back on before the save.  But to know for sure, it would take
    some testing.
