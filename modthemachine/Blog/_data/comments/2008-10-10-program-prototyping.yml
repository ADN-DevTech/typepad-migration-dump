    Can you perhaps give an example, or comment, on how to create an add-in using
    another IDE than MS Express editions?


    Specifically, there is an interesting free .NET IDE which you perhaps know about,
    namely SharpDevelop (<a href="http://www.icsharpcode.net/OpenSource/SD/),">http://www.icsharpcode.net/OpenSource/SD/),</a>
    other users may find it useful too.


    SharpDevelop does not have some of the limitations of the Visual Express range,
    so perhaps it is easier to deploy add-ins using it.


    Thanks.'
