    \ Image As System.Drawing.Image) As stdole.IPictureDisp\n        Return System.Windows.Forms.AxHost.GetIPictureFromPicture(Image)\n\
    \    End Function\n\nand next function\n\n Public Function IPictureToImage(ByVal\
    \ oPicture As stdole.StdPicture) As System.Drawing.Image\n        Return System.Windows.Forms.AxHost.GetPictureFromIPicture(oPicture)\n\
    \    End Function\n\nIt was a short and convenient :)\n\nThe truth is now to Windows7x64\
    \ Function IPictureToImage have a bug by converting.\n-----"
