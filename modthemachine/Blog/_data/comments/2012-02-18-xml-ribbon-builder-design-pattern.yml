  body: 'Hi Wayne,


    I tried the add-in. But the ribbons/buttons do not appear in Inventor. I changed
    already the path name in Autodesk.Ribbon_By_Xml_Example.Inventor.addin to the
    real path. What could be wrong?


    Thanks


    Georg'

  body: "Hi Georg,\n\nYou can debug the Add-In from Visual Studio. (In properties\
    \ for the project on the debug tab, change the setting so that it starts up Inventor)\
    \ Put a break point on one of the first lines in the Activate Sub. Start debugging\
    \ and step through the code to see where the problem is. If the breakpoint is\
    \ not getting hit then Inventor is not finding the dll. \n\nAlso there are tools\
    \ available that will allow you to watch when files are getting accessed. You\
    \ can use one of these tools to see if the dll file or addin file is being found\
    \ by Inventor. \n\nI hope this helps.\nWayne\n\n \n\n-----"
