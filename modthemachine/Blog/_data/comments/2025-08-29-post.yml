  body: 'Is it necessary for me to register (using RegAsm) any custom assemblies that
    my add-in class references?


    Here is the problem I am having:

    I am have created an add-in to Inventor 2009(in C#) and I am in the process of
    debugging it.  My add-in uses classes that are defined in other custom assemblies
    that I have created to be used with the add-in.  When I register the add-in, run
    Inventor, and click on my created add-in button, I sometimes get exceptions stating
    that my add-in cannot find the custom assemblies that are needed in order for
    it to run, although the assemblies are in the same directory as the add-in .dll
    and are of the correct version.'

  body: I have the expresss version of visual basic. I build a project in 32 bit and
    it works. I build it on a 64 bit machine and it doesn't show in the addins. I
    tried to manually registering it per your bat setup, got a successful register
    and it still does not show. What am I missing.

    I have created an Addin for Inventor using VB.Net in VisualStudio 2008, I have
    created it as a model-less dialog but when I press tab key the cursor is not moving
    to next tool.

    I have also checked the TabStop and TabIndex those are perfect and when I create
    the same as model then the tab order is working...Is there any possible ways that
    I can make the tab order working for model less dialog also...'

    Can I please ask you if you have the source code (either Visual Basic or "C")
    for the above project (AutoSave.dll) that I can download?


    Can you make the source code public domain?
