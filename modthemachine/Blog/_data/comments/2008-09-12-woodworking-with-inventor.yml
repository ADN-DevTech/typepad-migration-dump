  body: Nice job Brian.  It's neat to see how you are using the product and some of
    the challenges that occur. There are few things that say "quality" better than
    a nice dovetail joint.

  body: 'That''s an interesting method of determining your cuts from stock sizes.  Sort
    of a CNC method.


    I work with aluminum framed structures so I will eventually be tackling the same
    type of problem programatically (i.e. stock lengths are 20'', 24'', 30'' and I
    have 80 pieces to cut in all different lengths) so keep us posted on the progress
    of your "long term" project.  Good post!!'

  body: 'Very nice idea, Brian!

    I''m using Inventor in pretty much the same way, but didn''t think of this assembly
    approach to determine my cuts.

    I''ve been using the program CutListPlus alongside Inventor for my sheet layouts,
    but an integrated Inventor application would be just perfect! I''m sure CutListPlus
    could provide some ideas for your development.

    (For the record, I''m in no way associated with the company making CutListPlus,
    I''m just trying to contribute to your project!)


    Anxiously awaiting your further progress on this project!


    Greetings from Norway.'

    it;s time to start things up again. Thanks!

  body: Good post! I work with aluminum framed structures which ultimately will be
    fighting the same kind of problem by programming (ie values are lengths of 20
    ', 24', 30 'and I have 80 pieces of cut in all different lengths ) to keep us
    informed on the progress of its "long term" project.

    to show something of how I use Inventor at home.
