  body: 'Hi,

    I would like to learn more about writing vba code, and possibly learning to develop
    inventor addins. I have been using ilogic since the first beta versions were relased.
    Currently I work for a bridge design firm and I would like to try and persuade
    my bosses of the power of using 3D versus 2D for bridge and structural design.
    I am interesting in finding online courses, but if there are classes or training
    centers where I could become certified and what not, please advise. Also, if possible
    I''d like to know how to email this blog.

    Thanks.

    -----'
