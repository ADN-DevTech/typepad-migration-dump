  body: Very interesting post, I normally don't use anything like that so I found
    it very interesting. I'll check back and have a look for the finished vanity unit.

  body: I've only really just combined woodworking and technology and my own effort
    was merely a website, but reading your post it suddenly struck me that there are
    lots of possibilities to use computers and software in woodworking. Seeing the
    rendering of the vanity and then the pieces all laid flat was just so cool. Well,
    I've saw renderings of furniture before, and even been doing some of my own, but
    I've never seen them split into the component parts. This is something I'm going
    to have to look into. Maybe it would all be too complicated for me, I don't know,
    but worth looking into definitely. I was getting quite excited about the potential
    of 3D printers for plastic components, and now you've shown something just as
    cool for the wood itself. This time not printing but planning. Thanks for a great
    post!
