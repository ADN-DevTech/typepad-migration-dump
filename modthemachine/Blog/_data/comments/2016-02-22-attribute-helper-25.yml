    I''ve been looking for a better way to "connect" section views and sketched symbols
    for the various needs I have in my code, and attributes sound promising. If this
    allows easy editting of that, it would great! (Ie; adding sketch/sketched symbol
    attributes that are the same across all connected objects)'
