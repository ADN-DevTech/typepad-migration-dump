  body: "Hi,\n I am looking for developing inverse kinematics motion for Robot Simulation\
    \ with-in Inventor. But I have to use C++ for it. Because I have to integrate\
    \ a C++ library for the calculations.\n\nMost of the samples I found are in VB\
    \ or VB.net. Where to find good c++ samples for Inventor API.\n\nWell, for moving\
    \ the parts in assembly, what is the best way ? Manipulating with transformation\
    \ matrix or driving the parameters programatically in a loop ?\n\nPlease suggest\n\
    \nSubir Kumar Dutta\n-----"
