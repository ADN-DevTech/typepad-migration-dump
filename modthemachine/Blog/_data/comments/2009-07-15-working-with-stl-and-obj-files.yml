    Neat! Just a small FYI. At SYCODE (www.sycode.com) we offer Inventor add-ins that
    import STL and OBJ (among other mesh formats) to Inventor parts as solid objects
    (not client graphics) that can be edited using Inventor''s solid modeling tools.


    I hope this does not sound like advertising. Well, who am I kidding. It is, isn''t
    it. ;-)


    Cheers!'

  body: 'Hi Brian E.,


    This is interesting to me. I have an interest in hi-def, phase shift scanners
    (i.e. FARO, Leica, etc.) and there is a large gap between obtaining the scan data
    (point clouds) and being able to utlize that data inside Inventor (cost effectively).
    I am VERY new to programming and the API of Inventor, so please excuse any ignorant
    questions.  Could this add-in be extended to bring in "point clouds" as client
    graphics for which that data could also be leveraged in a 2D sketch?  Also, did
    you make the OBJ & STL files be displayed as client graphics to keep it light
    weight?  TIA!!

  body: 'Hi Brian, thanks for the facet enabler for AIP 2011, works well! However
    I have a client having issues not opening .stl file that I can.  I have told him
    to uninstall and reinstall but no luck there either, are there any tricks to uninstalling
    apart from add/remove progs etc?


    Thanks'

    This is not my own project. I finish it in a teamwork, so we spare the job in
