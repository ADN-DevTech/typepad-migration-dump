    Can how do we compare AlphaNumeric Values??

    If we have an array Like

    100A

    900

    1200

    1000

    1235

    2040


    we expect array to sort out like


    100A

    900

    1000

    1200

    1235

    2040


    How to get this sorting?? can we use same logic as you showed in your blog??'

    point accuracy is a completely different issue.


    What''s happening in your case is that you need to sort a series of strings in
    a particular way.  I recommend doing a search on sorting algorithms.  Depending
    on what your application is you might also be able to take advantage of sorting
    capabilities built into some of the Microsoft controls.'

  body: "Thanks Brian for the reply.\n\nI got my head around floating point concept\
    \ when writing export scripts for production.\nAnd with sorting, I found Quick\
    \ sort and bubble sort as quick and easy to use.\nBut, when sorting, how to compare\
    \ alphanumeric values(they have to be declared as variant)???\n\nFor i = lngMin\
    \ To lngMax - 1\n    For j = i + 1 To lngMax\n      If arr(i)) > arr(j)) Then\n\
    \        strTemp = arr(i)\n        arr(i) = arr(j)\n        arr(j) = strTemp\n\
    \      End If\n    Next j\n Next i\n\nany objects like Cstr,If IsNumeric are there\
    \ to compare?? \nIt wil be very helpful if we got around this.\n-----"
