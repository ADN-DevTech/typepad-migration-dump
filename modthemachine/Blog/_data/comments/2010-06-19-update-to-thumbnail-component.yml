  body: I am Update to Thumbnail Component, but this version not work correctly. Memory
    isn't released at the reference to given component(from my AddIns dll), thus occupied
    memory displayed in Inventore critically decreases (AIP 2010 - 32 bit).The previous
    version ThumbnailViewer.dll works correctly.
