  body: check out the Headfirst C# book.  Its different than any other i have seen,
    and explains the whole interface/inheritance thing going on, which is odd for
    VB'rs or LISPers.  I wish I had found the book sooner.

  body: 'I''m still rather newbee to programming, but I found the website "Home and
    Learn" a very good introduction to programming. Next I liked the book "Mastering
    Visual Basic 2010, Evangelos Petroutsos" as a very good reference. Its a bit intimidating
    by it''s size (1023 pages), but it contains nearly everything.
