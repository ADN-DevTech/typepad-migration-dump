    some time ago, we tried to use occurrence attributes as occurence properties.
    But how can we take them over to exchange formats like dwf, 3d-pdf, adsk,...?

    We found no way to do this.


    Thanks for any hints

    René'

    thanks a lot for your attribute utility, it''s very usefull.

    but i want to ask you, if it''s possible to the utility to show,color or highlight
    all the sufaces with attributes?
