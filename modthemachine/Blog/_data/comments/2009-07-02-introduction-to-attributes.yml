  body: 'Morning Brian,


    I''ve automated an assembly that puts shelves on different levels, and want to
    add text detailing the height and details of each shelf.


    I''m currently using drawings curves to identify components and add text to the
    relevant item, but I''ve discovered that on different machines, it puts the leader
    in different locations.


    Could Attributes be used to identify components and add the text in the correct
    location?


    Cheers


    Jon'

    I would need to see an example of what you''re doing and the problem you''re seeing
    to fully understand the issue.  I don''t know if attributes can provide help in
    your case or not.  An example of where they might help is if there''s a particular
    location on a part where you want the leader to point.  You could save that location
    (maybe the x,y,z coordinate) as an attribute and then use this information later
    when creating a leader.'

    i would like makes a attribute for checked the sub-assemblies with Y or N, and
    read the attributes into the IDW. It''s possible?


    Explain my case: Today, when changed an item IAM into BOM Struture for PHANTOM,
    the Inventor makes the sub-IAM file phantom, thus affecting all other places where
    it is used.'

    I started not a long time ago to look at API for inventor and I''m stuck with
    attributes..

    How do I determine what are the attributeSet ?

    The command attbSets.get_NameIsUsed("Description") tell you if it exist but if
    you would like to know what is the name when you know it exist. Can''t figure
    it out.

    Thanks'
