  body: "Maybe I should post this on a forum... \nIf I set an Attribute to a sketchedsymbol\
    \ (the symbol on the sheet, not the definition!) in a drawingdocument and save\
    \ this as a template (save a copy in the template folder), when I use the template\
    \ for new drawings, the attributes are gone... Tested on german Inventor 2016\
    \ Pro.\nIs this by design? Is this a bug? Are Attributes generally wiped on creating\
    \ new files?\nThanks!\nBR,\nDaniel\n-----"
