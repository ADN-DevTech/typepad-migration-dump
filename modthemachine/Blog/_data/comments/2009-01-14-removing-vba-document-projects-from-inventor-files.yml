  body: 'You need to run the program from the Command window where you can specify
    additional options.  In this case you need to specify the name of the Inventor
    file to remove the VBA project from.


    To open a Command window you can use the "Run..." command in the Start menu and
    type in "cmd" as the command to run.  This will open the command window.  Change
    directory to wherever you downloaded the utility to (C:\Temp\VBARemove in the
    example below).


    C:\Users\Ekins> cd C:\Temp\VBARemove


    Run the utility specifying the filename.


    C:\Temp\VBARemove> DeleteVBA.exe C:\Users\Ekins\Part1.ipt'

  body: 'After using DeleteVBA.exe all macros were deleted. We did this directly on
    a copy of the file store. The only problem that remains is that we get strange
    vault status in the Autodesk Vault:

    E.g. some of the files have green staus flags that do not get white if you check
    out this file.

    Does DeleteVBA.exe also influence the status flags? Do you know what to do about
    this problem?'
