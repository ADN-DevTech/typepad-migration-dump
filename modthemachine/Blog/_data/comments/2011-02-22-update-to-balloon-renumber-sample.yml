    I''ve followed your weblog for long time and I like it very much because of your
    professional and educational style reply.

    Talking about balloons in Inventor, I want to ask you if there is a possibility
    (through programming or iLogic) to wrap balloon rows in an idw drawing. We all
    know that Inventor attach a balloon only horizontally and vertically in a single
    row.


    Please kindly let me know.


    Thanks and regards,

    Lucian :o)'

    can u help me:

    I am workig on a vba solution that will make separate idw from the parts in a
    assambly.

    The only thing that i can''t get to work is after placing a baseview , i want
    to add(create) a balloon whit part information ( Whitout selecting a line in the
    base view). In the example i found, you always have to select a line in the view


    Thanks in advance'
