  body: I added one more sample to the post.  It's the last of the three and is simpler
    and is likely to be the functionality that more people will want.

    Great blog. I have a question. Previously we have flushed components to origin
    and avoided using grouding. What would happen if I ground a component also flushed
    to origin. Would Inventor skip computing flush constaints sinse it''s already
    fixed?


    Cheers

    Good question and the truth is that I don''t know the answer for sure but I believe
    that Inventor will optimize the solve and recognizes that it can ignore any grounded
    components.
