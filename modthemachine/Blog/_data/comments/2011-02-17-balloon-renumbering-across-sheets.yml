  body: 'When I place a balloon for the assembly (one is enough), this works great!
    But if a balloon isn''t placed at all, I get an error. The follow line is being
    highlighted:


    Set valSet = baseSheet.Balloons.Item(1).BalloonValueSets.Item(1)


    Any way to fix this, or tell the user an error message saying a balloon must be
    placed?'

  body: 'Hi Brian

    Brilliant code, I use it a lot, thank you.


    One issue: If the Sub Assemblies are on the same page (Page 1), the balloons do
    not update, I have to place the views on Page 2, run the code, then copy the views
    back to page 1.


    What changes can be made to the code to allow the ballons to update on page 1
    as well?'

  body: 'I achieve nearly the same thing without any VBA code: create a custom BOM
    column (e.g. "ITEM NO.") in the top-level assembly''s BOM.  Then edit the balloon
    style to display "ITEM NO." rather than "ITEM".  Add the "ITEM NO." column to
    the Parts List style (overwrite the column header to read "ITEM" if you wish).  In
    the top-level assembly''s BOM, copy the "Item" column and paste it into the "ITEM
    NO." column.  Now the balloons display a custom iProperty associated with each
    part, rather than Inventor''s assigned item number within each assembly.  So,
    no matter where the assembly or sub-assembly lies in the drawing, the balloon
    always shows the same number.'
