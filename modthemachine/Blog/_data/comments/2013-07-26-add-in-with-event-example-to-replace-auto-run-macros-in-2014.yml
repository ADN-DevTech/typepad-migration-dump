    \ is about Vault but the idea of using the event would be similar.   \n<a href=\"\

    The community could have a good suggestion for this. Also my colleagues and I\
    \ do answer questions there. (upload a file with the macro that works in 2013)\
    \ \n\nI am not finding a working example to provide at this time.\n\nThanks,\n\

    Is VB 2008 still supported in Inventor 2014, or is there already an ''inventor
    add-in template'' for VB 2010?


    Thanks in advance'
