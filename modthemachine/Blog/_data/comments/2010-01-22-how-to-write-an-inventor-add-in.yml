  body: 'Hello!


    What about the debugging? I tried to debug using Visual Basic 2008 Express and
    Inventor 2010. Then appeared next message:


    ---

    A project with an Output Type of Class Library cannot be started directly.


    In order to debug this project, add an executable project to this solution which
    references the library project. Set the executable project as the startup project.

    Does it take extra operations/code trics to get to debug with Inventor process?
    I tried with one kind of them, but I got same problem message.

    \ AddIn.\n\nEverything works fine for me but the registration. I cannot get the\

    \ colleague’s.\n\nI you have a minute, could you take a look at a posting on the\
    \ topic “AddIn; loads only in one Inventor release” in “Inventor Customization”,\
    \ at Autodesk Discussion Groups? I’ve put a few facts concerning this matter.\n\
    \ \nIf you ever think of something I could try, your help would be greatly appreciated.\n\
    \nThanks in advance.\n\nYves"
