    Hats off to you for writing such a wonderful Inventor API. You have indeed helped
    a lot to Inventor Customizers by supporting at Customization Discussion Forum
    and now by Blogging.


    I am looking forward for more Inventor API tutorials from your side.


    Thanks & Regards,

    Rajeev Lochan

    P.S: I have made a humble beginning with Inventor API & Customization and have
    blogged about it with ScreenCasts at http://www.smallguru.com . It would be great
    if you could go through them and give feedback'

    It would be great if you could activate "Subscribe by email" for your Blog. Right
    now, you just have "Subscribe Feeds in a Reader" by FeedBurner.
