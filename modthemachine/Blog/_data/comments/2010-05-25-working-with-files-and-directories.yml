  body: "Hi Brian,\n\nI was wondering if you can tell me whether it's possible to\
    \ (on creating a new file from a .idw template) prevent display of/replace the\
    \ dialogue that appears to fill in the prompted text entries. \n\nI've tried capturing\
    \ the different events that occur whilst opening a new file using the Event Watcher\
    \ provided in the SDK but to no avail.\n\nThanks,\n\nAlex.\n-----"
