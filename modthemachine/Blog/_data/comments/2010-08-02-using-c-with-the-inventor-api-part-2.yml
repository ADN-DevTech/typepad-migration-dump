  body: 'Hi Brian..  Please keep em coming!!!

    I´m fighting alot to make VBA examples work in C#. This code was how I got an
    example from the helpfiles working in C#



    WorkPlane wXY = part1.WorkPlanes["XY Plane"];

    object pXY;

    compOcc.CreateGeometryProxy(wXY, out pXY);

    pXY = (WorkPlaneProxy)pXY;



    In VBA  the WorkPlaneProxy is defined as a WorkPlaneProxy BEFORE the call, but
    this threw an exception in C#.. I would really appretiate if you could explain
    ( with a few concrete examples like above ) the underlying differences between
    C# and VBA regarding typing, as it seems to be a major issue I´m facing again
    and again.
