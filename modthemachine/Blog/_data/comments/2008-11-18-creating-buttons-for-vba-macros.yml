  body: 'Brian.  I am trying to this in IV2010 but it never displays the icons in
    any of the environments, always the default icon.

    Lets say i have a macro called "Sub ActiveStandard ()".  My icon is called Module3.ActiveStandard.Large.BMP
    and is located in my project location.


    What am i missing?  Does the macro need to call the icon?'
