  body: "Dear Brian, \n\nThank you very much for powerfull infos, but I would discuss\
    \ about one interesting issue.\nI created AddIn in VB2008ExpressEdition from inventor\
    \ template. The AddIn referenced to Autodesk.Inventor.Interop.dll, which exists\
    \ in C:\\Program Files\\Autodesk\\Inventor 2010\\Bin\\Public Assemblies. I used\
    \ the value 12 of SupportedSoftwareVersionGreaterThan... subkey in COMRegistration\
    \ Region . AddIn works fine in both versions of Inventor (2009 and 2010) unless\
    \ the both versions are installed. Other PC, where is installed only Inventor\
    \ 2009, is not able to register AddIn, because Interop.dll does not exist on the\
    \ specified path. My question is: Does exist solution for this issue? And what\
    \ next, if Inventor 2011 come to us, and I will have only 2011 version installed\
    \ on my PC? Will be registration succesfull or not? \nIt's really necesary, to\
    \ create a AddIn for each version of Inventor especially? \n\nI hope that you\
    \ understand my issue. Please, write me back your opinion. \n\nThanks in advanced.\n\
    \nLubos."
