  body: 'You legend! Thank you very much. I actually ditched CefSharp last night and
    got it working with ChromiumFx. I had exactly the same problem and only found
    info on the BrowserSubProcess requirement really late. I didn''t realize it was
    the same in CefSharp. I prefer CefSharp so I think I''ll go back to it. Thanks
    again for figuring this out!
