  body: 'It''s possible to iterate through the entire assembly structure.  This is
    discussed in detail in a more recent blog posting:


    <a href="http://modthemachine.typepad.com/my_weblog/2009/03/accessing-assembly-components.html">http://modthemachine.typepad.com/my_weblog/2009/03/accessing-assembly-components.html</a>


    Each occurrence obtained while traversing can have it''s color set.  This is an
    override that''s defined at the level of the top-level assembly and does not change
    the subassemblies or parts.
