  body: 'Brian,


    I ran thru this example using C# and it builds successfully, but I have to manually
    register the dll to get Inventor to see it.  I am running Vista64 / Inventor 2009
    64 bit.  Do I need to do anything different for the 64 bit vs the 32?


    Just got back from AU - had a great time!


    Thanks,


    Bob'
