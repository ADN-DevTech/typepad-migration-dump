  body: I would like to know what the difference is between linking to the interop
    under Program files or the interop under C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\..\... etc..
    and should we use one over the other?

  body: The interops in the GAC (C:\Windows\Microsft.NET\Assembly\...) are intended
    to be private and you should always reference the one in the "Inventor\Public
    Assemblies" directory.  Previously, Visual Studio wouldn't allow you to directly
    reference interops in the GAC but it doesn't block it anymore.  When you reference
    a primary interop outside the GAC but it also exists in the GAC, .NET is able
    to find the one in the GAC and use it.  So for example, let's say you create a
    program using Inventor 2015 and reference the interop in its "Public Assemblies"
    folder.  Then someone uses that program on a machine that only has Inventor 2016.  You're
    program will still work because .NET finds the 2015 version in the GAC and uses
    it.  Inventor installs several version of the primary interop into the GAC to
    support programs written against older versions of Inventor.
