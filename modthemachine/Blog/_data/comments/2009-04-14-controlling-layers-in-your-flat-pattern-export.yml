    Would be nice to change the line colours as well as the layer names.'

  body: 'Hi,


    I realise I must be particularly ''thick'' but can anyone explain how I implement
    iFlatPatternExport to run within Inventor 2009. I extracted the rar into a new
    folder within the Inventor programme bin but when I run Inventor no export option
    appears to be available.


    Help please?


    Thank you.
