    Thanks for the tutorial. One question left for me. Is it possible to debug regfree
    Addins in Visual Studio 2010 Pro and if so, is there anything diffenrent to "normal"
    Addins?'

  body: 'Hi,

    Thank you very much for the step by step tutorial.

    So decided to convert my c# app to registry free and thought I got it but it stil
    doesn''t load. It shows in the Add-Ins as unloaded even if I set it to load at
    startup. I doesn''t matter if i open/create a part it still doesn''t load when
    I do the Loaded/unloaded in the Add-In manager. Any ideas ? I added caption right
    at the start of my program but don''t see anything. I''m running windows 7 32b.
    Thank you for your help. Regards. Fred'

  body: 'Hi Fred,

    From your description it seems like Inventor is finding your AddIn and trying
    to load it. If you debug and put a breakpoint on the Activate method does it get
    hit?


    Also using a tool like ProcessMonitor to see if the correct dll is being accessed
    by Inventor could help: <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/cb56073f-62a3-4ed8-9dd6-40c84cb9e2f5.aspx">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/cb56073f-62a3-4ed8-9dd6-40c84cb9e2f5.aspx</a>


    When you built your dll did you have AnyCPU set? Also which version of .NET Framework
    is it using? Inventor 2012 uses 3.5


    Hope this helps,

    Wayne'

    Thanks for a prompt reply.


    It is set to AnyCPU, Inventor 2012 and I''m using .NET 3.5. I tried to put messages
    to in the activate method right at the start. Nothing happened. Will try the breaks
    next.

    I ran my Process explorer whci I use all the time...-:) and found that if I start
    Inventor I have my DLL showing the path for process inventor.exe \Device\Mup\servername\...\name.dll
    & HANDLE ?

    May bebecause I use a map network drive ?

    Thanks again. Fred'

    Just change the path to the dll to C:\MyAddIn\ just to make sure and same thing:


    Inventor.exe 352 DLL C:\MyAddIns\...\name.dll

    Inventor.exe 352 Handle C:\MyAddIns\...\name.dll


    Thanks. Fred'

    Got it. All docs tell you in Application -> Assembly Information to uncheck Make
    assembly COM-Visble. But if I check it back it all works fine. Not sure why and
    may be you ca nexplain but that will work for me. Thanks you so much for the website
    and support. Best Regards. Fred
