    Once again more great stuff. Unrelated to this topic but I''m hoping you would
    be kind enough to read through this thread <a href="http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/Autodesk-Inventor/Inventor-for-Woodworkers-Joinery-Millwork-and-Cabinetry-Design/td-p/3064850/highlight/false">http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/Autodesk-Inventor/Inventor-for-Woodworkers-Joinery-Millwork-and-Cabinetry-Design/td-p/3064850/highlight/false</a>
    and maybe give some advice or offer an opinion? The length, Width, Thickness being
    automatically generated for irregular shaped or irregular orientated parts is
    the biggest issue for Inventor woodworkers and I''m sure a lot of Inventor users
    creating parts lists for ordering stock, or creating cut lists. Then there are
    a few other points in that thread that may be of interest to you.


    Cheers for any help you may have the time to give


    Scott'
