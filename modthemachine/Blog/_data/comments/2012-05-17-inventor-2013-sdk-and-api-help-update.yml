  body: 'Brian, we do suffer problems with ColorSchemeEditor (SDK/UserTools). After
    first its application.

    When it is run next time (and on some other actions) the error pops:

    Microsoft .NET Framework.

    Value of ''1280000040'' is not valid for ''alpha''. ''alpha'' should be greater
    than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 255....

    Coould it be so that UserTools need to be updated also?'

  body: 'Hi Brian,

    Does the developer tools msi work with the Visual Studio 2010 express versions?
    I have Visual Basic Express 2010 installed and are receiving an error that it
    is unable to find an install of Visual Studio.

    Regards,

    Allan'

    I pulled the zip file and see four files, with the primary files being


    Inventor 2013 API.pptx

    Inventor2013.ivb


    the other two are part files just for convenience in running a couple of the samples.  Are
    you seeing something else, or problems with this files?
