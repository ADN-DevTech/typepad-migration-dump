  body: 'This looks great!  Good job!


    I have been looking into modelling woodworking projects with Inventor and other
    than the CadSetterOut blog I have not been able to find too many detailed posts
    on the actual process.


    Since you modeled this in Inventor would it be at all possible to have a ModTheMachine
    post with some details on how to go about creating something similar (including
    the types of joints etc. that would be applicable?)


    That may be asking a lot but it would be very informative and useful!  (Please?)'

  body: 'I definitely don''t claim to be a woodworking expert so I''m not sure what
    I''ve done is the best example.  I''ve found that I learn a lot with each project
    and there are also things I would change with each one if I could do it over again.


    One of the main joints I used in connecting the cabinet together was pocket holes.  I''ve
    used those and biscuit joints in quite a bit of work that I''ve done.
