  body: Brian, could you expand on the issues regarding signed assemblies and versioning.
    My understanding is that if you distribute strong named add-ins, each version
    (i.e. each build if versioning is on, which is the default) would require the
    user to unregister (or uninstall) the current add-in assembly and then register
    (or install) the new one. This negates updates via dll copy that can be accomplished
    with unsigned add-ins. Is that correct?

  body: 'Hi Brian

    What do you think of registering an AddIn using the "/tlb" switch of regasm.exe


    Such as : C:\WINDOWS\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v2.0.50727\regasm /codebase ".\CustomCommand.dll"
    /tlb:".\CustomCommand.tlb"; (assuming the dll is in the same folder as the bat
    file containing the regasm instruction).


    So far I do not find this registration part so easy... :)


    Tech specs:

    Using Inventor 2008, soon 2010

    Windows XP 64Bits

    Visual C# 2005


    Thanks in advance.
