  body: "related to lab 7, how would you add a flange feature to the face?  I tried\
    \ and I am getting type mismatch errors wrt:\n\n oSheetMetalFeatures.FlangeFeatures.CreateFlangeDefinition(Edges,\
    \ FlangeAngle, Distance)  \n\nI successfully made face features with the same\
    \ oSheetMetalFeatures.FaceFeatures...etc.  I verified I'm passing in a valid edge\
    \ (is it to be a collection?), but I guess I'm not getting what type angle and\
    \ distance need to be.  Tried enumerators, passing in parameters, passing in values\
    \ from parameters, passing in values like '1.57 deg' etc.  Any help will be greatly\
    \ appreciated."
