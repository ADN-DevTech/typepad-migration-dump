  body: I pasted the macro, however, it is telling me the sub is not defined.  I am
    very new to VBA and know barely anything about.  I have been trying to do some
    reading about it, but have not really been able to practice anything with it.
    I initially pasted all the text in one module, but got an error telling me nothing
    but comments were allowed after the end sub statement, so I pasted the private
    sub on a seperate module.  ANy help would be greatly appreciated.

  body: 'Add both sets of text into the 1 module. Edit the long lines that end in
    _ so that the lines are joined together (see example below) :-


    hello, _

    there,


    Becomes :-

    hello, there


    Save the macro and run it. It works fine for me.'

  body: How can I alter this code to selectively remove or ignore components going
    in to the new assembly?  I can place a value in an excel file indicating a particular
    component is not needed.
