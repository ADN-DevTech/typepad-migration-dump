  body: 'Hello,

    This is really cool, but is there any way to do the same from the Assembly bom
    view.

    Like it is right now you have to do It from a Drawing and select a bom .

    How can you export the assembly BOM into word without a Drawing present?


    Regards.

    I tried your code, the list is created but without the previews.

    Could not we be able to print, also in PDF from the assembly as the bill was structured?


    Thanks

  body: 'Doesn''t work under Russian AI2010x64.

    It says "A part list must exist on the active sheet". The Part list does exist.
    In Russian it is Спецификация. It is probably due to another term used in localised
    ver?'

    You should be able to use the ReferencedFiles property of the PartsListRow object.  It''s
    a hidden property that was retired when the DrawingBOM functionality was added.  It
    still works to allow for backward compatibility.

  body: 'Brain,


    I have a drawing with an assembly. That drawing also has a detail drawing a part
    from the assembly. But the part for the detail drawing has been opened by separately
    so is not a part of the assembly. Therefore if I attached a balloon to the part
    it shows 1. I am looking for a solution where I would be able to attach the balloon
    for the part from the assembly parts list.


    Thus I am looking for a code like:


    1. record a path (folders/sub-folders) of parts from the parts list or the assembly
    with the item numbers from the parts list


    2. check if the part (that opened individually but the same drawing)  does much
    with the records list

    3. if yes attach the balloon with number from the assembly part list.


    So I am looking for a vba code or similar code to modify...


    if you could help mi please with it


    many thanks


    Wojciech'

    It works great on our Inventor 2011 x64.

    But we only get the partlist on first level.

    Is there a way to get the full partlist (hierarchical)?
