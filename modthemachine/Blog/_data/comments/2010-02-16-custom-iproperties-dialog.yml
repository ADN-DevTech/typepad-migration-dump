  body: "Hi, Brian\n\nVery interesting. \nA question: There is a way to put these\
    \ iProperties in a tooltip?. For example when you have an Assembly this tooltip\
    \ shows information (part number, weight, and so on..)when you pass the cursor\
    \ over each part. (similar to AutoCAD). Is it possible?\n\nThanks!!"

    It will be a very useful tool for us, if I can get it run.  Could you give me
    more detail on how to "open the source within VB Express and compile it"?


    Thanks.'

  body: 'To open and compile this in VB Express, just download and install Visual
    Basic 2008 Express.  You can get this at:


    <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/express/Downloads/">http://www.microsoft.com/express/Downloads/</a>


    There is also Visual Basic 2010 Express.  It should also work but I haven''t spent
    much time with it yet so there are some unknowns.  To keep it simple I would stick
    with 2008 to get started.


    Once that''s installed and you''ve downloaded the sample program, just double-click
    on the iPropertiesPlus.sln file.  This will open up the program within Visual
    Studio.  Finally run the Build command from the Build menu.  This will create
    the add-in and also perform the required registration.  The next time you run
    Inventor you should see the new command in the ribbon.
