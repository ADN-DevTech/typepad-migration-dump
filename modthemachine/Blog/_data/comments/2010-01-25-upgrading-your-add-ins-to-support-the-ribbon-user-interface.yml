  body: "Hello!\n\nThere was a good information to make one button to the fileBrowser.\n\
    \nIs it possible to programm header and many buttons on it to the fileBrowser?\
    \ I mean just like: \n\nManage: Projects, Migrate, ... (many buttons).\n\nI tried\
    \ to do it on some ways. One is below:\n\n---\nDim fileControl As CommandControl\
    \ = UIManager.FileBrowserControl\n            Dim ManagCombo As CommandControl\
    \ = _\n                fileControl.AddPopup(m_Manag, m_Projec, , , \"AppiPropertiesWrapperCmd\"\
    )\n            ManagCombo.AddButton(m_Projec)\n---\n\nThank you for your any help,\n\
