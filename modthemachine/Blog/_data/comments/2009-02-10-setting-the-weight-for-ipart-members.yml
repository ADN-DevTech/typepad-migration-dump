  body: So in my opinion this just needs to be behand the save button. You even check
    if this an ipart so you leave the message out and you never have any issue right?

    Thank you very much, excellent macro. I was needing this function a long time
    ago.

    I built from your source code, another version, but with some modifications:

    - For iAssemblies too.

    - Included the area field (for painting, m²)

    - A toolbar for with two buttons for each function.

    I left the units for area as "ul", because Inventor API doesn''t have explicit
    square units (m²) only (m m).

    If somebody need this macro, please send me a message.


    Cheers!'
