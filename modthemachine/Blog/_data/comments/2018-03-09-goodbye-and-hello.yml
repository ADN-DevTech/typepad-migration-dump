    Setting dimensions doesn''t work as it doesn''t constrain the angles the splines
    are drawn at.  That is you can still use the grab handles to swing the arcs around,
    and that''s exactly what Fusion 360 does when you try to scale stuff.


    The end points don''t move, but you don''t get the curve you were expecting.
