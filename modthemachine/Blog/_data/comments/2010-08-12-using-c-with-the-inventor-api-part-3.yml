  body: 'I just opened my fresh copy of "C# 4.0 in a nutshell" and allready on page
    5 "Dynamic binding" is mentioned as the biggest innovation in C# 4.0.. "useful
    when interoperating with dynamic languages and COM components"..  Any chance on
    showing how this can affect casting & typing in the API with some examples in
    part 4 ;)..
