  body: 'There are other problems with Parameter IO as I''ve discovered in the last
    24 hours.


    First, it throws an error if you try to use a reserved parameter NAME. One big
    problem with this (IMHO) is that I can find no list of reserved parameter names!
    The only way I''ve found to discover the offending name is to try entering them
    manually through "Change Parameters" in Fusion360. But this plugin exists to avoid
    manual entry!


    Second, once it throws the error, it ALWAYS throws the same error when you try
    to import ANY .csv files intended as parameters! And this persists if you shut
    down and restart F360, if you reboot your computer, even if you un/re-install
    F360!


    I''m hoping that the "Adam" who posted this is the same Adam at Autodesk I''ve
    been working with to try to resolve these problems.
