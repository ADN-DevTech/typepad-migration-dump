  body: 'Image files (tif, jpg, bmp) are handled differently than geometry based translations.  Because
    of that none of the approaches discussed above will work.  However it is possible
    using a different approach.  See my other posting for an explanation.

  body: In Inventor 2012 (and possibly other versions), these methods work fine, except
    when functions are executed from a service, where Inventor is started without
    visibility or a drawing plane). Do you know of any solutions to solve this.  I
    can get it to run fine outside the service.

  body: 'Working with Inventor through a service is not something supported by Inventor.  Being
    “not supported” doesn’t necessarily mean that it won’t work but it is something
    that is not designed for and is not tested.  Because of that I don’t know what
    the behavior will be.  Obviously you’ve run into an issue where the behavior is
    different.  I know there are a few issues where Inventor expects there to be a
    visible view.  This is mostly when working with drawings.  There can also be cases
    where certain registry entries or configuration files are looked for in the user
    directory and I’m not sure if that process works the same in finding the current
    user when you’re running from a service.  It’s unknown territory.
