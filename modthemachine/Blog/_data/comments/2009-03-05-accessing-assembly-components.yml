  body: Hello, when using script "ChangeAllPartMaterial" an error message "Set oAsmDoc
    = ThisApplication.ActiveDocument" appears, in form of "Tipe mismatch"; if I remove
    "Set oAsm....", application shows a message, that particular kind of material
    is not recognized in the library. I´ll be very grateful for your advice on this
    problem.

  body: I suspect the first error is because you're running this when a document besides
    an assembly is active.  This macro expects an assembly to be active.  The sample
    also expects that there is a material named "Gold" in your materials library.
