  body: Interesting article. Using transaction you also have to consider the huge
    amount of memory Inventor consumes. Using single steps (no transaction) Inventor
    releases the memory at every step. With transaction the memory will be released
    just at the end. This might lead to potential crashes.

  body: 'This will cause a bit more memory to be consumed but no more than you would
    expect if you adjusted the number of undo steps available.  To illustrate let''s
    assume that the undo stack will allow up to 10 undo operations.  When working
    interactively that means the memory consumed will be up to 10 individual actions.  By
    using the API it is still 10 actions but those actions can wrap multiple sub-actions.  For
    example, you might write a macro that uses transactions and creates 100 lines.  Internally
    there were 100 transactions but they''re grouped into a single transaction for
    undo.  Those 100 transactions will used whatever memory is needed to support undo.  When
    they drop off the undo stack that memory will be recovered.


    I think it''s a small price to pay to be able to undo the placement of the 100
    lines whereas without the transaction ability the user would have only been able
    to undo 10 of the 100, in this example.
