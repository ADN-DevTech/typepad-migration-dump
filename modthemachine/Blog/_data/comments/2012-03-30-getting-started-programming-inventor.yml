  body: "Brian,\n\nI have been told to try and gain audience with you, as I've created\
    \ a Hybrid model assembly some people feel that you need to see. I've taken some\
    \ iParts and iAssemblies and put them together with iMates and control the various\
    \ configurations with a user form, iLogic and some of my own code. I've automated\
    \ the model assembly so that it builds itself based on what is chosen from the\
    \ user form. I can go into greater detail if you could contact me. When I seemed\
    \ to have hit a wall towards the end of this project, I posted on the AutoDesk\
    \ forum and caught the eye of a co-worker of yours. Once he had seen my Configurator,\
    \ he thought it was \"awesome\". I would like you to see what I've built, I believe\
    \ there is nothing else like it. I work for a Philadelphia based (100 year old)\
    \ company. I am also on the Autodesk Beta team. Please contact me. \n-----"
