  body: 'Hi Brian,


    About the error when downloading the 64-bit SDK update.  Can you try it again?  I
    tried downloading and installing it on my machine, which is also 64-bit Vista
    and it worked without any problems.

  body: 'Hi Brian Ekins (all the "Brian''s" are confusing)


    I went back to the download site several times that day and it finally worked.  Incidentally,
    I had a similar issue with downloading the Inventor Tooling Suite.  I tried the
    website (autodesk.com/ait) and it came up as "Not found".  Went back several times
    (today) and finally it worked.  I have a brand new machine, with security settings
    fairly low and no Anti-virus firewall going, etc.  Could be a fluke. Thanks for
    checking!!
