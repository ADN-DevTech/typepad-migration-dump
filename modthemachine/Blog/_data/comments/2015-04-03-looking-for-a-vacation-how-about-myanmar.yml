  body: Good that its a tourist friendly country now. Its not easy travelling without
    planning especially in days where we have very less time.

  body: 'You sound like someone who would enjoy the Friendship Force. It''s based
    on exchanges where you stay with a family for a week, long enough to get to know
    one another. There are hundreds of FF clubs around the world, and exchanges are
    between pairs of clubs, so you''re in a small group rather than completely alone.
    That''s got both pluses and minuses, of course, but I think the pluses dominate.
    The SF Bay Area club (mine) is at <a href="http://FFSFBA.org,">http://FFSFBA.org,</a>
    and the international organization that does the scheduling is at <a href="http://friendshipforce.org/">http://friendshipforce.org/</a>

    Thanks for telling about Myanmar!
