  body: I'm aware of Xamarin, Tony, but I've not bought a license to try it. Its one
    of several cross-platform SDKs available for mobile devices. It seems you're a
    fan, because you made a very similar post to Kean's blog. My reply is the same
    as Kean's. Personally, I prefer to learn a new platform via the native tools,
    and this series is documenting my experiences doing that for anyone who is interested.
    If you're not, then no need read it :-).

  body: 'Your and my personal preferences aside, I think any discussion about converting
    C# to Java merits at least brief mention of alternatives to conversion, using
    tools like Mono for Android and MonoTouch for iOs, because they can eliminate
    the need for conversion and dramatically reduce the cost of targeting multiple
    platforms insofar as non platform-dependent code goes. Making readers aware of
    those tools is just a professional courtesy, irrespective of one''s own personal
    preference.


    While Android itself is largely written in Java, the native tool on Android is
    actually C++, not Java. It may also be worth mentioning that because Mono For
    Android bypasses Java and the Dalvik runtime for many things it does and instead
    uses P/Invoke directly call native code, C# applications on Mono For Android consistently
    outperform equivalent or similar Java applications, and have far less battery
    consumption.'

  body: 'I suggest you keep your eye on our Cloud and Mobile DevBlog. I know Gopinath
    already has plans for looking at the available cross-platform development technologies
    in due course.


    And sorry if I caused confusion with my use of the phrase ''native tools''. My
    intended meaning was ''tools provided/recommended by the vendor'', which I think
    was evident from the context in which I used it. Gopinath has already mentioned
    on C&M DevBlog that Google discourage the use of NDK unless its strictly necessary
