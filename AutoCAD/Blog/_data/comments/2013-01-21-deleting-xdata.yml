  body: 'Hi Ben,

    1) have you tried to run the code? That will exactly remove the Xdata of the specific
    app named ''MyApp''.

    2) Abort is to terminate this transaction, it does not responsible to dispose
    the transaction object.


    In addition, I’d suggest you could post question on AutoCAD API board. There are
    many gurus of AutoCAD API there. You would be able to get answer timely. You can
    enclose the blog url there.
