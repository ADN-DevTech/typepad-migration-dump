    racing game. The game gives players the ultimate thrill with dramatic chases on
    the highway, where you have to control your car to glide through a series of obstacles
    and police cars chasing behind.

  body: Thanks for sharing that! This approach is quite common and has been part of
    our internal reference patterns as well. Great to see it documented in various
    places, no surprise it came from Tony. He's one of the top contributors in the
    AutoCAD community!

  body: 'Thanks for the complement (I''m Tony). I should point out that credit for
    the version I linked to goes to Cyrille Fauvel, who many moons ago posted a rudimentary
    example showing how to use the classes involved. All I really did was polish it
    up and package it in an easily-consumable form.


    And, thanks for that minor improvement with the try/catch.
