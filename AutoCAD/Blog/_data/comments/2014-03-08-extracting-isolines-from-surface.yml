  body: 'Hello Dear Sir,


    Code look like incredible.. But copy paste to notepad and saving .lsp than holding
    and dropping into autocad occurs an error look like this `extra right paren on
    input`


    I decided to check the lisp from vlisp than at this time i`m getting this error
    `:CALLBACK-ENTRY` (debug- break an error checked!)


    And another question is command name brep ?


    I hope you can help us for correctly runing this lisp because it`s so important
    for us.


    Thank you & Best Regards'
