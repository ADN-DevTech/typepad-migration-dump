  body: 'On ACAD 2011, these functions are exported from acad.exe. You have to save
    the initial color in order to restore it at the end. You can get it with acgsGetHighlightColor


    [DllImport("acad.exe", CallingConvention = CallingConvention.Cdecl, EntryPoint
    = "?acgsGetHighlightColor@@YAGXZ")]

    static extern uint acgsGetHighlightColor();


    But when I override the color, the pattern (dots) is not displayed anymore. Why?
