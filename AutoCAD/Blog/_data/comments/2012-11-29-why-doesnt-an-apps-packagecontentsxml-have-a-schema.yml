  body: Ok, but when the loading fail, please display an explicit error message, not
    a cryptic (and undocumented) error code. I've lost several hours in order to find
    why my bundle was not loaded by AutoCAD. If it was one of my guys (in fact, I've
    got only one) who wrote this kind of thing, I will have fired him :-P

  body: "Hey Maxence!\n\nah, personally I think the error code guy should have been\
    \ promoted actually :-) \n\nThe idea is to give you guys a tool which builds your\
    \ app installers for you, but we haven't finished it yet, so that's why something's\
    \ are not finalized... \n\nBest thing next time is to just ask... The codes are\
    \ bitwise as follows:\n\nERR_SETENV 1\nERR_COMMAND_REG 2\nERR_WRITE_REG 4\nERR_GROUPNAME_REG\
    \ 8\nERR_LOAD_FAILED 16\nERR_NO_APPNAME 32\nERR_WRONG_SCHEMA_VERSION 64"

  body: My problem is I can not find good fundamental documentation to know what I
    need to ask or if I am asking the right question.
