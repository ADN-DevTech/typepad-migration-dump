  body: I understand that the VariantWrapper class is creating a COM Variant ByRef
    data type to supply the COM object GetBoundingBox method.  But I don't understand
    what the ParamterModifier[] is doing?  It looks like it's supplying the Type.InvokeMember()
    method with an array of a list type class.  But why did you set it with two items?  Why
    are both values true?  Why does it have to be supplied at all?

  body: If the purpose of this post is purely to show how to make late-binding call
    to COM API, it would be better to use a more appropriate tile, so beginners are
    not misled to think this is the way to get entity's extent size/BoundingBox, because
    one has already had an entity open in transaction, Entity.GeometricExtents is
    the all code one need to write, why bother with COM API and late-binding?
