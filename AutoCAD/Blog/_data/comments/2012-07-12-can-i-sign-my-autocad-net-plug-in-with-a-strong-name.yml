  body: 'Hi Andrey,


    If we strongly name an assembly then we must put into the GAC otherwise we take
    a massive performance hit when the assembly is loaded (because all pages in the
    image must be loaded and hashed).


    Once we put an assembly into the GAC we must make sure that the dependencies of
    the assembly are also in the GAC or SxS so that they can be loaded.


    acmgd.dll depends on acad.exe which means that we would have to put acad.exe and
    all of its dependencies into the GAC/SxS. This would create more problems than
    it would solve. See how VS 2012 moves away from SxS to offer easier deployment
    for C/C++ runtime, MFC.

  body: 'ok, 2015 autocad has stuffed us!!! pre-2014 we could do binary serialization
    on our custom object, but no longer!!! not either autocad or net4.5 REQUIRES strongly
    typed names in the GAC to do this!!! So now I''m desperately trying to get and
    attach a cert for interanl software!! I just did and guess what - "vbc : error
    BC30145: Unable to emit assembly: Referenced assembly ''Acdbmgd'' does not have
    a strong name" - with a digital signature. What the heck are we supposed to do
    here!!??'

  body: 'So then, what are the implications if i want to obfuscate my dll?


    I''m quoting from the CryptoObfucsator manual:



    >> Enable Tamper Detection


    > When checked, Crypto Obfuscator will itself perform strong name verification
    of the assembly even if strong-name verification has been turned OFF on the machine
    on which the assembly is running or if the assembly has been registered in the
    verification ''skip-list'' - this is typically done by hackers or crackers. Furthermore,
    the strong name verification is done using the original key used to sign the assembly
    when it was obfuscated by Crypto Obfuscator. Thus, strong name verification fails
    even if the key is removed or replaced - again something typically done by hackers
    or crackers.


    > Note that your assembly must be originally strong named for this to work and
    you must specify the same strong name key via the Signing / Authenticode tab.
    If you turn ON this setting for an assembly for which you have not specified a
    strong name key, you will receive the following error message:


    > The assembly xyz has the ''Enable Tamper Detection'' setting ON but no key file
    is specified via the ''Signing / Authenticode'' tab. Please specify a key file
    and try again.


    So what are the implications of this: I cannot enable tamper detection on my assembly
    using crypto-obfuscate?
