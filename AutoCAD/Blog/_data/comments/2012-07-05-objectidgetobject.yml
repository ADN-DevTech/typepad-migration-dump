  body: "As convenient as it may seem, something that only recently came to my attention\
    \ is that Objectid.GetObject() is woefully inefficient. Each call to that method\
    \ results in the creation of a managed wrapper for the owning database, followed\
    \ by this:\n\n  Database.TransactionManager.TopTransaction.GetObject(...)\n\n\
    If you have code that makes a potentially huge number of calls to ObjectId.GetObject(),\
    \ I would suggest changing it to call the TransactionManager's GetObject() method\
    \ instead, as it is far more efficient."

  body: 'Thank you Tony. That is useful information. If you''re performing a large
    (batch) operation that is tying up the user''s machine while he waits then that
    is certainly a consideration. For that scenario, its also worth reading Fenton''s
    comments on relative performance in the open/close article I referenced above.
    (But note that ObjectId.GetObject doesn''t work with OpenCloseTransactions).


    Its very different when you''re writing a command that is requesting user input
    and performing a relatively small number of operations based on that input. In
    this case, the user is the bottleneck, and the speed of your code really doesn''t
    matter (unless its incredibly slow) - and there are other ways to invest your
    time to make the user feel your application is fast - I''ll write a quick post
    on that now.'

  body: Yes, as I mentioned in this thread over on the swamp (<a href="http://www.theswamp.org/index.php?topic=42197.0),">http://www.theswamp.org/index.php?topic=42197.0),</a>
    casual use (for lack of a better term) is not a problem. But many of us write
    code that iterates over potentially-large selection sets or BlockTableRecords,
    and that's where it matters most.
