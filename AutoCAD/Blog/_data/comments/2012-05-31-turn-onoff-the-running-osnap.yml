  body: "It really does not matter in this case because AutoCAD sets the MSB (Most\
    \ Signifcant Bit).\n \nConsider this, if we are to check for the MSB :\n\n100\
    \ in binary = 4 in decimal\n\n101, 111 are both greater than 100 and hence the\
    \ > check.\n\nIf you are using newer versions of AutoCAD, all you have to do is\
    \ to check for the SNAPMODE system variable.\n\nThanks for your comments"

  body: The code fails to demonstrate proper programming practice and it will break
    in the future if new bits are added to OSMODE. It is embarassing code that reflects
    badly on you and on Autodesk, which should matter.

  body: It really does matter because we are not assuming anything about what other
    flags AutoCAD may or may not set, now or in the future, and because of the simple
    fact that testing bits in a byte-encoded value is not supposed to be done using
    > or other relational operators, because that is what the logical operators &,
    | and ~ are for.

    when OSNAP is turned off.
