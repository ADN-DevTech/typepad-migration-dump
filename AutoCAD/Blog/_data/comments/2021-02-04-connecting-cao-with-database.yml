  body: 'Well, the whole description of how to connect to CAO with database is only
    focus on how to connect to *.mdb/*.accdb (MS Access database). It would be better
    to pointed out at beginning, because CAO can also connect to other database via
    ODBC data source.

    However, this article omitted a most important requirement for connecting MS Access
    database: one must install 64-bit MS Access DB Engine (because latest AutoCAD
    does not have 32-bit version any more), which  has been a troublesome issue, especially
    most CAD users would have 32-bit MS Office suite (or even 32-bit MS Access installed).
    So, post article with this important omission would encourage the use of bad combination
    of AutoCAD and MS Access database.

    Also, Jet database has long gone, yet, AutoCAD carries the pre-configured sample
    data source "Jet_dbsample" version by version, which is useless without 64-bit
    MS Access DB Engine pre-installed on almost all CAD computers. If AutoCAD is to
    keep a not-working preconfigured sample CAO data source, at least change its name
    (i.e. removing "Jet_" from the source name).'

  body: 'Hi Keyur,


    I''m struggling to understand the problem here, do you mean that you have created
    an ARX rulebuddy2021.arx compiled with VS2019, when bound with OEM program you
    are getting this error ?

    Is the OEM stamp successful ?


    I request you to raise a developer ticket with A D N support. Some one from our
    team will gladly assist you.'
