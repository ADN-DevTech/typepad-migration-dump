  body: 'Simple question but I have not been able to find a simple solution.


    In windows explorer I can right click on a .dwg file and view, under the "Custom"
    tab, all of the custom Drawing Properties I''ve added (in AutoCAD Drawing Utilites
    -> Drawing Properties). Its great I can copy info from outside autocad with my
    mouse.


    What I really want to do is extract that information, read only, with a vba or
    powershell script, and send it to a text file with the same name as the drawing.
    Unfortuantely I do not currently have visual studio and can''t compile the above.


    How can you, outside autocad, pipe a custom property to a text file? Something
    like


    cmd> customApp A-Test.dwg "custom Title" "target output directory"


    Creates A-Test.txt with text "my custom title here"'

  body: 'Hi Yan Sid


    Without Visual Studio you cannot compile this code... sorry. But the same should
    be available via VBA/VB6 COM Automation, just add DwgProps component.


    If you like more features, then try the AutoCAD Console, you can automate it with
    BAT files and some scripts (.scr files).

  body: I compiled your code in Visual Studio Community. It crashes whenever trying
    to open a Autocad 2015 file. Is there a package I'm missing? Not too familiar
    to this blog, I'm guessing your code is built upon assuming you already have another
    package installed?

  body: 'Rodrigo, this sample is in C++ (so it doesn''t uses packages), but you need
    to compile it using the COM references. It also should not require you to start
    AutoCAD (as it uses only the COM API for Dwg Props). Finally the VS Community
    doesn''t include MFC (I believe) that is required for CString (among other Windows
    features).
