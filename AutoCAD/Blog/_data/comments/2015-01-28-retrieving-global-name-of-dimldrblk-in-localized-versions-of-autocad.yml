    I thought you might be interested to learn that there’s a first ever AEC application
    with the Oculus integration in development, and you might want to try it yourself.
    My team is finalizing the integration now, and we’d be happy to provide you with
    such an opportunity. The app will allow AEC professionals and their clients to
    explore building design and construction projects in a truly immersive virtual
    reality. Please reach me via n.bauman@revizto.com if you’re interested in details.

    Cheers!'

    Sorry, I am not aware of the reason behind it.

    But it could be that the names of the blocks indicate the shape such as DOT, so
    it might make sense to have them in local language for users to quickly recognize.
