  body: 'Hi Fenton,


    I have read this and other pages and still have an uncertainty over whether a
    final end customer using Acme OEM can load and run a plain text lsp file

    eg

    ChangeLayer.lsp

    (command "_.LAYER" "_COLOR" "1" "0" "")


    Could you clarify please


    Thanks Adam'

    unfortunately, you can''t just load LISP files into OEM : first they must be compiled
    into .fas, then the fas file must be bound to the OEM product at build time.'
