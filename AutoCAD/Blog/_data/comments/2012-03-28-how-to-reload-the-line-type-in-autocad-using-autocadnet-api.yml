  body: 'hi virupaksha, thanks for sharing this example to which my question relates:
    how does the document manage the linetype table records and its .lin file, i.e.
    how are differences handled if say a linetype is created in the .lin file and
    a linetype of the same name exists in the linetype table? does a linetype persist
    in the database if a linetype table record is created but the .lin file is not
    accessed? thanks'

  body: "Hi \nLine type file used only to create line type. AutoCAD does not maintain\
    \ any link between line type file and the line type created. If user loads a line\
    \ type name which is already present in drawing, the line type in drawing is updated\
    \ to reflect the line type in the newly loaded file\n\nThanks\nViru\n-----"
