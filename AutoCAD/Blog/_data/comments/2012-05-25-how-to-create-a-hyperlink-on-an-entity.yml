    Can you try set it back?


    Read with

    Dim hyperL As HyperLink = hyperlinkColl.Item(0)


    Change the description...


    Then write back

    hyperlinkColl.Item(0) = hyperL


    Hope this helps.

  body: 'Hello Augusto, thankyou for the answer.

    Tried out the suggestion but getting an ''AccessViolationException, Attempted
    to read or write protected memory. This is often an indication that other memory
    is corrupt''.


    If I do the following:


    hyperlinkColl.RemoveAt(0)

    hyperlinkColl.Add(hyperL)


    I''m getting the same exception.


    The only way to solve the issue seems to create another Hyperlink instance, such
    as


    Dim hyperL2 = New HyperLink


    then


    hyperL2.Description = hyperL.Description

    hyperL2.Description "New description"

    hyperlinkColl.RemoveAt(0)

    hyperlinkColl.Add(hyperL2)


    In this case all works fine.


    It would be interesting to investigate...


    Thankyou


    Best regards.

    There is mistake:

    You shouldn''t use hyperLink.SubLocation. Instead use


    hyperLink.Name = "http://adndevblog.typepad.com/autocad/";


    Otherwise you will have incorrect link like "ADN DevBlog#<a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/autocad/"">http://adndevblog.typepad.com/autocad/"</a>'

  body: Aleksey is right, don't use hyperLink.SubLocation it is for bookmarks. hyperLink.Name
    did the trick for me.

  body: 'And how can I create a hyperlink to an image on the network?

    I''ve created a tool that lets the user select a folder with photo''s and the
    tool reads the GPS location and puts a triangle at this location with a hyperlink
    attached to it.

    The idea is that when the user clicks on the triangle the picture taken at this
    location is automatically opened.
