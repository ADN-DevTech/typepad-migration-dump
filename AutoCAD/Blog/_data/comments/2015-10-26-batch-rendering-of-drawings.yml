    the screencast looks a little bit strange: the size of embedded area is too small,
    the sidebar with the commands is really big and the time of the movie is displayed
    as "0:13 / 0:00".


    Is it possible to improve it?


    Thanks

    also in Fullscreen the picture is strange: the left half of the display is darkened
    and overwritten by huge strings, displaying the currently used commands.
