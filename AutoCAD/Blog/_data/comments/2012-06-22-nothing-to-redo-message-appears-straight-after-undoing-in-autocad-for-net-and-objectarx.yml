  body: 'Hi Fenton,


    I know this is quite old now, but I have a problem when overruling subGetGripPointsAt()
    in a custom entity (the code just increments a point3d property). When the .NET
    overrule is enabled UNDO and REDO stop working. The same c++ property is being
    modified in both cases.
