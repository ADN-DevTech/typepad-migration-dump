  body: 'Hi Balaji,

    Thanks for the post.

    I want to evolve this example to use an ObservableCollection and bind it to a
    RibbonCombo.

    I''ve got as far as the combo does contain objects but does not display a single
    property for example the name. I''ve tried setting the path nut the binding fails
    completely; no objects appear in the combo.

    Is there another example elsewhere that demonstrates this?

    Thanks
