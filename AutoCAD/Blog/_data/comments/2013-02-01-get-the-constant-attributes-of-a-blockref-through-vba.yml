  body: 'Hi Augusto,

    I have an autocad drawing contains many blocks and blocks under the same name,

    My question is how can I count the blocks that have a certain name? For example
    I need to know how many blocks in my drawing have the name: "Block1" through a
    VBA Code.


    Thank you a lot for your help

    Zakaria'

    You may need to open the model space, then run through the collection of entities,
    check if is a AcadBlockReference, if so, check the Name property, which points
    to the block name defined for it.


    Hope this help.
