  body: Actually after a little more experimenting I found that the OpenCloseTransaction
    causes some other issues with the conversion. In particular the converted polyline
    couldn't be selected, so I'll go with what you have here.

  body: OpenCloseTransaction is now working for me. You just have to make sure you
    add the newly created polylines to the transaction using AddNewlyCreatedDBObject().
    At the end of the day I get the same result.

  body: 'The given code works if the polyline2d is of Poly2dType.SimplePoly or Poly2dType.FitCurvePoly.
    However, it fails with eNotApplicable if the type is Poly2dType.CubicSplinePoly
    (and I would imagine the same would happen with Poly2dType.QuadSplinePoly). From
    ConvertFrom docs: "entity must point to a SimplePoly or FitCurvePoly type of Polyline2d".


    Any ideas on how to convert CubicSplinePoly or QuadSplinePoly to Polylines? Is
    it possible?'

  body: Hi Viru, I am getting a eInvalidInput at the poly.ConvertFrom line. I am supplying
    it a 2D Polyline, with true flag as shown in your example. I also copied your
    code into a separate module to see if it works, but it fails wit the same error.
    Any Idea why or how I can do this?
