  body: 'Hi, my name is Hishamm and I was just reading a post for you from 2012 which
    is "Converting C# to Java – An Experiment (Part 1)". I would like to know if you
    were trying to explain in this post how to show an AutoCad drawing in Java or
    were there more functions that you were trying to utilize as well? Thank you.
