  body: 'Thank you for the tip, it''s very useful.

    I ran the script and found that some my filed failed on the process. The reason
    is that the <b>"Process timeout..."</b> parameter value is not enough to finish
    recover process for drawing.

    It would be nice if you can mention that in your tip. Thank you.'

    I have seen references on AutoDesk blogs to a 64 bit build of the product ...
    where can it be downloaded.
