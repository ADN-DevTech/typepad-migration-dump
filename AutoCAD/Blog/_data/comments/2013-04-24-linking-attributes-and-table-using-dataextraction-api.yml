  body: "Hi George,\n\nTo unlock the table for editing, traverse the cells in the\
    \ table and set its state as \n\ntable.Cells[row, col].State = CellStates.ContentModifiedAferUpdate\
    \ |\nCellStates.FormatModifiedAfterUpdate |\nCellStates.Linked\n\nAs AutoCAD treats\
    \ the cell content as modified, the next time the table content is updated, a\
    \ messagebox will appear before overwriting its contents using the DataLink."

    My concern is about to turn a text box of a value in the attribute window into

  body: "Hi,\n\nThanks so much for your article, Balaji, it works great, but I've\
    \ a problem when modifing your code. Instead of using your first part to create\
    \ DXE file, I just copy a fine DXE created by AutoCAD wizard.\nWhen I execute\
    \ your code, I obtain an error message (eDataLinkAdapterNotFound) with this line\n\

    \ DXE link or if I execute AutoCAD Dataextraction Command before launching the\
    \ code, it's OK, but if I just open a file without any DXE link, error appears.\n\
    If I add only this line\n    DxExtractionSettings setting = new DxExtractionSettings();\n\
    execution is OK.\nIs there any solution to solve this problem without adding an\
