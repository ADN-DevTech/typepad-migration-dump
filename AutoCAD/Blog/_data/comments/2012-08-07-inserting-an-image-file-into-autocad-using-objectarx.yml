  body: Actually, the code I posted above is insufficient.  It will keep AutoCAD from
    crashing during the insertion, but as soon as it tries to use the reactor (i.e.
    screen redraw), there's an access violation, so something else needs to be initialized
    in the RasterImage subsystem.  I can force initialization by calling an existing
    command like "IMAGEFRAME" or "IMAGECLIP", but I don't know how to initialize the
    RasterImage subsystem properly in C++.  Does anyone know how?

  body: 'I finally found the example of how to initialize the AcDbRasterImage subsystem.  It
    doesn''t involve any explicit calls to rxInit or anything like that, just a simple
    loadModule:


    acrxDynamicLinker->loadModule("acISMobj15.dbx", true)'

  body: 'You must change the line type of radterimage to a invisible line type (for
    invisible line type read this : <a href="https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/autocad-architecture-forum/invisible-linetype/td-p/3207240)">https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/autocad-architecture-forum/invisible-linetype/td-p/3207240)</a>


    Or you can change IMAGEFRAME system variable to 0 but in this way all rasterimages
    in all files are affected.
