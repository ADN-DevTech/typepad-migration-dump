  body: It is not correct to assume that the parameter of a "halfway point" is the
    average of the two endpoint parameters. The mapping between parameters and points
    is entirely up to the implementor, and it could just as well be a logarithmic
    or other non-linear mapping. The correct way to get a "halfway point" is to use
    getDistAtParam to get the distances (say d1 and d2) at both parameters, then getPointAtDist
    to get the parameter at (d1 + d2 / 2.0).

  body: 'this is FAQ from most beginners.

    it is a great explaination.

    i think getPointAtParam(0.5) just means get the mid p between first p and second
    p'

  body: "What about circle (AcDbCircle), spline (AcDbSpline), ellipse (AcDbEllipse)?\n\
    What about ray (AcDbRay) and xline (AcDbXline)?\nIn the general case getPointAtParam(0.5)\
    \ is not middle point between first point and second point.\n \n-----"
