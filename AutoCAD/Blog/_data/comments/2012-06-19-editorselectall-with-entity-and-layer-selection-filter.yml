  body: 'I''m using ed.SelectAll and ed.Getselection a lot because of the speed of
    these methods.


    When I debug my app with C# VS 2010 in AutoCAD 2013 the speed has reduced a lot.
    This is related to the number of objects in the drawing, large drawings will totally
    freeze my app.


    Loading my (Debug as well as Release built) app in AutoCAD without debugging in
    VS solves it, the speed returned again. So publishing to my customers is no problem.


    Did you notice this issue too with AutoCAD 2013?

  body: 'Hi,


    Sorry, you cannot use SelectAll API to select the nested (entity inside the block
    reference). You need to use GetNestedEntity API . refer <a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/autocad/2012/05/modifying-contents-of-a-picked-cell-inside-a-table.html">http://adndevblog.typepad.com/autocad/2012/05/modifying-contents-of-a-picked-cell-inside-a-table.html</a>
