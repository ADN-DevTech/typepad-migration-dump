  body: 'Hi Balaji,

    Thanks for the detailed implementation. It worked fine for me except one problem.
    In my architectural drawing I have 2 sofas(block references) that are referring
    the same block(sofa). Now, if I colorize one sofa, the other one also gets that
    color. Is there any way to fix this?


    Regards,

    Mohan.'

  body: "Hi Mohan,\n\nSorry, I couldnt reply promptly. I needed some time to investigate\
    \ the possibility of doing it.\n\nI dont think this is possible to do with DrawableOverule.\n\
    \nWhen AutoCAD calls the “WorldDraw” of the DrawableOverrule, the drawable that\
    \ is obtained as the first parameter does not hold any information regarding the\
    \ blockreference. \n\nInside the “WorldDraw” the “drawableEntity.OwnerId.Handle”\
    \ refers to the block definition.\n\nDuring the nested entity selection, the “FullSubentityPath”\
    \ has the ObjectId of the block reference as well as the selected subentity. Since\
    \ the same info isn’t available in the “WorldDraw” of the DrawableOverrule, there\
    \ is no way to colorize the entities independently."

  body: 'Hi Mohan,


    I have tried to address this in a different blog post :

    <a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/autocad/2013/11/drawableoverrule-to-highlight-entities-in-nested-block-references-and-xrefs.html">http://adndevblog.typepad.com/autocad/2013/11/drawableoverrule-to-highlight-entities-in-nested-block-references-and-xrefs.html</a>


    Sorry, I think I had given up too quickly when you first asked about it.


    Hope this helps.
