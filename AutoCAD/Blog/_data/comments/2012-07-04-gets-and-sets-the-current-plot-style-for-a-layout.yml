  body: 'Is this code run without exception?I try to run,but at the line :plotSetVal.SetCurrentStyleSheet(layoutObj,
    str);threw an exception,says eInvalid input...,and I check the help file,is says
    the first parameter should be PlotSettings instead of Layout.

    Actually,my problem is no matter what style sheet I set,the line in the ploted
    file(pdf) always has it''s color,but I want them all black.

    Any suggestions?thank you.'

  body: 'Just found out that one needs to say "<b>Use<b> the Stylesetting".


    Thus in VB this line:


    acPlotSetValidator.SetCurrentStyleSheet     (acPlotSettings, StyleSheet)


    is followed by:


    acPlotSettings.PlotPlotStyles = True


    That works for me. (after few months of pulling my hear out)
