  body: 'Hi,  Madhukar!

    I''ve checked my ObjectARXSDK 2018\inc\rxsdk_common.props but did not found _CRT_STDIO_ISO_WIDE_SPECIFIERS
    definition in it. What wrong with my ObjectARX SDK 2018?


    Best Regads,

    Is your SDK latest download from website ?.

    Possible that correction might have included.


    Developers who are having SDK from beta days are finding this issue.'

  body: 'Yes! I have ObjectARX SDK 2018 from Autodesk website (not beta). File rxsdk_common.props
    has such line:

    <b><PreprocessorDefinitions>_WIN32_IE=0x0600;WIN;WIN32;_CRT_SECURE_CPP_OVERLOAD_STANDARD_NAMES=1;_CRT_SECURE_CPP_OVERLOAD_STANDARD_NAMES_COUNT=1;_AFXDLL;_UNICODE;UNICODE;%(PreprocessorDefinitions)</PreprocessorDefinitions></b>

    There is no others preprocessor definitions.


    So it is look like best offer - download and install the latest version of the
    ObjectARX SDK 2018 from Autodesk website: http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/item?siteID=123112&id=785550'
