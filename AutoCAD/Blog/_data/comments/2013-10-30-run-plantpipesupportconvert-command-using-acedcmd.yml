  body: 'Hi Wayne,


    I really like the procedure you have outlined here and I am trying to get it to
    work in Plant3D 2014.  When it gets to the selection the insertion point for the
    newly created pipe support it says "Point must be on a pipe or piping component",
    and the only way I have been able to get it to work (unacceptably) is to switch
    the NEA Osnap on and zoom out so the width of the pipe is within the aperture.


    Do you have an updated version of this code that runs successfully on Plant3D
    2014?


    Kind Regards,

    Colin Holloway'

  body: "Hi Colin,\n\nWhen I posted this example it was working. However I have seen\
    \ the problem you mention in 2014 and did not find a work around for it. I just\
    \ tried it in Plant 3D 2015 and it is working every time. I used acedCmdS. Can\
    \ you try this in the 2015 version?\n\n\n  [DllImport(\"accore.dll\", CharSet\
    \ = CharSet.Ansi, CallingConvention = CallingConvention.Cdecl, EntryPoint = \"\
    acedCmdS\")]\n        private static extern int acedCmdS(System.IntPtr vlist);\n\
    \n...\n\n   // acedCmd(rb.UnmanagedObject);\n  //Testing 2015 - not in blog post\n\
    \    acedCmdS(rb.UnmanagedObject);\n\nIn 2015 managed API you could use the Command\
    \ method of the Editor instead of acedCmdS. This works in my tests in 2015. \n\

    Thank you for your quick response!  Unfortunately the company I work for only
    has Plant 3D 2014 deployed and they have no plans to upgrade at this time (when
    they do it will be to 2016).


    I will have to find a different way to make this work, like getting the user to
    select the point manually.


    Thanks again,

    Colin'

    3.5 years later and we are back in the sample place!


    The solution I came up with in 2014 was a LISP routine that creates the 3D Solids
    of the required supports and then runs

    (command "_.PlantPipeSupportConvert" supss "" p1)

    to create the support.


    This worked well in Plant 3D 2016 as well (with a change to command-s).  Now we
    are migrating to Plant 3D 2018 and this issue has reared its head again!


    This method works for supports in the middle of a pipe run, but we use a thrust
    support that is mounted on an elbow and connects to the end of the adjacent pipe.  In
    2014 and 2016 I was able to use END osnap and the support would attach to the
    end of the pipe, but in 2018 this doesn''t work.


    Are you aware of any changes or tips to get a support to connect to the end of
    a pipe?


    Here is a screen cap of what I was able to do in Plant 3D 2016:  <a href="https://a360.co/2Ha5uUh">https://a360.co/2Ha5uUh</a>
