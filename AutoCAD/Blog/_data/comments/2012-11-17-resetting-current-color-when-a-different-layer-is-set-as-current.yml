  body: "what about changing objects colors when printing so cadd users can use their\
    \ internal habitual colors but print using another companies ctb file.  In other\
    \ words, every object that is green (bylayer or byentity) upon print command changes\
    \ to red (for instance) then changes back to green.  This way a user can map their\
    \ colors to an outside companies colors for plotting due to ctb file differences.\
    \  Application could compare ctb files or just have a manual lookup table saved\
    \ in a txt format.  Maybe the option to convert colors permanently for digital\
    \ dwg delivery.  \nTime for me to learn arx maybe?\n-----"
