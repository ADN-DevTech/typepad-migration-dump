  body: 'Hello.


    I am trying to use the following VBA in order to export all the layouts in a pdf
    file.


    ThisDrawing.SendCommand ("-EXPORT" & vbCr & "PDF" & vbCr & "ALL" & vbCr & varFile
    & vbCr)


    Unfortunately this does not work. After a while a plot error comes up, but it
    does not give any message.


    When I execute the commands one by one in the command line it works.


    I tried as well to indicate the file name instead of the variable (which is a
    string) but no luck eather.


    Any ideas?

    \ following VBA code :\n\nPublic Sub Test()\n    ThisDrawing.SendCommand (\"filedia\
    \ 0 \")\n    Dim varFile As String\n    varFile = \"D:\\Temp\\VBA.pdf\"\n    ThisDrawing.SendCommand\
    \ (\"-EXPORT\" & vbCr & \"PDF\" & vbCr & \"ALL\" & vbCr & varFile & vbCr)\nEnd\
    \ Sub\n\nCan you please try running Lisp code from the command prompt ? The publish\
    \ result popup in AutoCAD can help provide more information on the error.\nPlease\
    \ try this, if you are using AutoCAD 2015 :\n(command-s \"_-EXPORT\" \"_PDF\"\
    \ \"_ALL\" \"D:\\\\Temp\\\\my.pdf\")\nor this one for the earlier releases :\n\
    (command \"_-EXPORT\" \"_PDF\" \"_ALL\" \"D:\\\\Temp\\\\my.pdf\")\n\nRegards,\n\

  body: 'Hello Balaji,


    I ran the code and it works great! Thank you! I am having a problem with trying
    to get the file name from the file to insert into the newly created PDF as a file
    name. I used the "getfilename" but it seems not to work or I am not calling correctly.
    Any help you could provide would be greatly appreciated. Below is the code:


    Public Sub Test()

    ThisDrawing.SendCommand ("filedia 0 ")

    Dim varFile As String

    varFile = "P:\Instrument Group\PDFs\Test\" + getfilename + ".pdf"

    ThisDrawing.SendCommand ("_-EXPORT" & vbCr & "PDF" & vbCr & "" & vbCr & "" & vbCr
    & varFile & vbCr)

    End Sub


    Thank you!'
