    You mentioned if install was too large and would take longer than 6 seconds then
    should use a different method.


    Out of curiosity for large install would installing the contents to folder called
    xxx.bund and during install checking every second or so if the folder size has
    increased and if not renaming xxx.bund to xxx.bundle work?'

  body: "Hi Jeff\n\nthat's a good point, I see your point. The problem is that adding\
    \ multiple checks costs CPU and adds risky complexity to the code, and actually,\
    \ I don't think it will be an issue even with a large installer. \n\nThe reason\
    \ is because when the Autoloader detects a new bundle, of course it waits 6 seconds\
    \ for the install to complete, but even then it waits even longer for AutoCAD\
    \ to become completely silent from all inputs and commands, including mouse moves.\
    \ That means, unless you install the application and then immediately switch back\
    \ to AutoCAD to simply sit back and watch the OnAppearance contexts kick in, it's\
    \ very unlikely that you will run into this problem. Also, the time taken for\
    \ an MSI to actually place the files is extremely quick - most of the install\
    \ time is taken up with disk costing and the like.\n\nKeep your comments coming,\

    Do you know of any way to override the Autoloader from doing this?


    I have a bundle folder, and the autoloader will fail loading an assembly stating
    that it cannot find it in my documents.  If I rename to folder to something other
    than bundle so it does not get autoloaded, and then netload from that directory
    all is fine.


    I try to subscribe to the appdomain assemblyresolve event but the event is never
    fired.

    it only loads modules that are defined in the PackageContents.xml.


    Some assemblies, like WPF assemblies, hate being installed and run away from the

    as children of your ComponentEntry, a good example is found in the Performance

    I see where my question was confusing and seems I talking about the Autoloader.


    I meant for the installer to handle that and no reason to check as just wait for
    it to return after copying files then rename.


    It was mainly out of curiosity if AutoCAD would ignore a folder if it did not
    end with .bundle.


    Have not run into any problems and last thing we need is me writing enough crap
    code that takes that long to install.

    actually, it subscribes to all the standard functionality of AutoCAD, or at least

    You may need to add the SupportPath attribute to the ComponentEntry so that the
    SupportPath contains a relative path to the bundle which points to the same folder
    where your MNL file resides.


    By the way, .MNU files should also work via the Autoloader.'

    I must have some sort of bug causing this. The undesired behavior has been going
    on now for a few days, and while new to Autoloader (perhaps I should have read/watched
    more first?), I am not exactly known for being incapable.


    Presuming this is user error on my part, I just went through and tested this again,
    with a new .bundle, with nothing in the .MNL other than a LISP Alert function
    call.


    I just uninstalled the last 2014 Beta, and am having trouble installing RC, but
    2013 does now load the .MNL as expected, using the same PackageContents.xml as
    before. 2012 however displayed the Alert three (3) times. Knowing that is an issue,
    as all versions are using the same .bundle, I restarted 2012, and it displayed
    the Alert five (5) times.


    Not sure if the RC/.bundle difficulty is related or not, I''m not exactly sure
    what to do at this point, other than to uninstall, and start again with all fresh
    installs.


    Again, many thanks for your time.'

    I''ve just created the MSI for my plug-in, which, following the security recommendations,
    requires administrator rights to install the bundle into the %programdata% folder
    (per-machine).


    It supports 2014, 2013 and 2012, however, it won''t get loaded in 2012, unless
    it resides into the %appdata% folder.


    I guess it''s a good practice to provide a single installer, so the options are:

    1. To move all to %appdata% (per-user)

    2. To use the common MSI to install one bundle into %programdata% (for 2013/2014)
    and another one into %appdata% (for 2012).


    Since I don''t like any of the above options, especially the latter seems quite
    scary, I''m pretty sure there''s something I miss...

    I wondered if Autodesk is considering a company''s need to be able to support
    .bundles on an enterprise level (read network), rather than relegating to per-computer
    (local disk) distribution?


    A CAD Manager, and IT department will find it much more agreeable to allow for
    Autoloader in this manor, as an employee need only identify the plug-in that would
    benefit their work, remit a simple internal request with the link, the CAD Manager
    can have a layer of review, and implement on the network... IT will prefer this,
    as the CAD Manager has the rights to install where needed, and no duplication
    of data is replicated out to each-and-every-single-user in the Enterprise.


    The implied task, is that the CAD Manager needs access to a FilesPreferences Property
    in their Profile that identifies the location(s) from which to load said .bundles
    from the Network (which would then have to be manually Trusted), etc... Just a
    thought.

    Yes, it''s been very carefully considered. The main problems are security (.NET

    What we have at the moment (2014) is something called Chained Deployments. These

    sorry, I was on vacation yesterday.


    I can see that the CUIX copies can be annoying. The reason they are copied is
    so that users can edit them. if something isn''t being cleaned up on bundle uninstall,
    then that''s something that needs to be addressed. However, I do believe that
    2013/2014 versions do a better job of cleaning up, and even the latest sp of 2012
    does also - have you checked?


    Feel free to open a DevHelp online request to discuss/solve these issues.'

  body: "No worries; I hope you enjoyed your time off.\n\nThe CUIx copies aren't simply\
    \ annoying, they are unnecessary.\n\nTo your comment on 'they are copied is so\
    \ that users can edit them'....\n\nWe're talking about a CUIx from a .bundle,\
    \ and if said .bundle is downloaded from Autodesk Exchange, whom exactly is the\
    \ party responsible for repairing .bundle CUIx file(s) that are broken by user\
    \ modification? Since Autodesk prepared the installer used, are you responsible?\
    \ Or is the plug-in author responsible for that via customer support contact information?\
    \ \n\nTabling the topic of should, or should not, the user be able to edit a .bundle\
    \ CUIx downloaded from Autodesk Exchange... The user can edit a given partial\
    \ CUIx from within the source .bundle folder itself without being replicated to\
    \ local installation's ..\\Support\\ folder. If a user doesn't have sufficient\
    \ folder permission(s), that's an issue for their employer's IT department.\n\n\
    To demonstrate, when one uses CUI Editor to make change(s) to an Autoloader-loaded\
    \ CUIx file the changes are made to the CUIx copy (mapped to local ..\\Support\\\
    \ folder), and not the source CUIx located within the .bundle itself (the one\
    \ which PackageContents.xml specifies)... Even after session close, neither the\
    \ change(s) made, nor the save date, is reflected in the source .bundle CUIx file\
    \ (just tested by adding a new toolbar with a single command).\n\nTo your comment\
    \ on '.bundle uninstall'....\n\nDo you (Autodesk) expect that companies do/will\
    \ not use Autoloader for their own internal utilities? They're certainly not going\
    \ to publish them at Autodesk Exchange for competitors to review.\n\nAutoloader\
    \ functionality needs to allow for companies, and users that simply create their\
    \ own .bundle(s) without an installer... More importantly preclude this 'residue'\
    \ byproduct that currently exists.\n\nNothing has come from my pointing this out\
    \ during Beta, then again offline with you in March by email, as here we are again...\
    \ So I'll be sure to give that DevHelp request a try. \n\nAs always, thank you\
    \ kindly for your time, and consideration."

    Another useful reference is simply to download some of the free apps from apps.exchange.autodesk.com

    Below is the part of the xml code. I am not sure if i am calling the command "Trial"

    <ComponentEntry AppName="PW2NW" AppDescription="My Program Library" ModuleName="./Contents/PW2NW.dll"

    </Commands>

    </Components>



    Name of the dll is PW2NW

    Name of the command in dll is Trial.

    In summary, on autocad/civil3d startup, the dll should load and after the custom
    dll command

    should run.


    Any suggestions? Thanks in advance.'
