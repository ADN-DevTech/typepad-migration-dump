    You may need to show the DllImport definition for acedCmd for 2013 and prior to
    2013

    ... If my memory is correct.

  body: 'Hi Fenton,


    I am trying to do a similar thing using JavaScript. I have a webpage with a dwf
    map embedded on it. I get some variables using a GET method from another form/page
    and I parse that info variables. These variables work as the Object id''s for
    the object I want to select inside the map. Right now, the selection works but
    I can''t zoom into the selected object. Since its a huge map I need some kind
    of flag to notify where the object resides. Here''s a link to the code I have
    so far: <a href="http://pastebin.com/zy8NW1ey">http://pastebin.com/zy8NW1ey</a>
