  body: Working with the AutoCad 2017 API...what happened to these viewport methods
    (IsLayerFrozenInViewport, FreezeLayersInViewport, ThawLayersInViewport)?  They're
    not there.  Were they replaced?

  body: 'Hi Wayne


    After some debugging. It seams to ignor the first layer in my selectionset even
    though upon debug, I watch the function oViewport.ThawLayersInViewport(idCol.GetEnumerator())
    and it is operational so, I included layer "0" and it is subsequentially the first
    layer in the Selectionset, therefor it is the one that gets ignored but I don''t
    care in this case.'

  body: "The above code has been very useful in helping me to develop code to freeze\
    \ layers in all viewports in all layouts except for one chosen viewport.  However\
    \ this is for paperspace of the viewport.  I would like to do the same for modelspace\
    \ for each viewport (reason is I don't want to see some model space entities in\
    \ some viewports).  I have the following code which works for the first layout\
    \ then doesn't freeze any other viewport model space layers.  lcoll is a collection\
    \ of layouts created before the code, targetviewport is the viewport I don't want\
    \ layers frozen on, layerEnumerator is for the layers I want frozen.\n<pre>\n\
    \        For Each l In lcoll\n            LayoutManager.Current.CurrentLayout\
    \ = l.LayoutName\n            Dim viewportIds As ObjectIdCollection = l.GetViewports()\n\
    \            For Each vpId As ObjectId In viewportIds\n                Using acTrans\

    \ Viewport)\n                    If viewport.Number <> 1 Then 'ignore the first\
