  body: "I made a customized Block named 'STower' in a 'block.dwg' file and then copied\
    \ it to the current 'wire.dwg'. Then in the 'wire.dwg' I copied the 'STower' block\
    \ 10 times. \n\nI followed the code it print like  this, 'Dynamic block \"STower\"\
    \ found with 1 anonymous block and 11 block references'.\nIn the AutoCAD I saw\
    \ 11 'STower' blocks.\n\nI just want to know what is 'anonymous block' and 'block\
    \ reference'.\nWhat are the differences?\nMany thanks!"
