  body: 'Hi,

    While inspecting namespaces i found an interesting class named CurveCurveIntersector3d
    in Geometry namespace. It provides functionality to find intersection of two curves.
    Even better it says if you give the same curve for both operands then you can
    get if the curve is self intersecting or not.'
