  body: 'Hi, I see, this is an older post, but maybe it''s still active. Is there
    a way to find out, which object is involved in a certain command execution?

    Especially if the command "GRIP_POPUP" starts on a dynamic block, the current
    selection does not seem to help, since I can start the command even if multiple
    obejcts are currently selected and the command affects one Blockref only.

    Any hints are appreciated.

    Thanks,

    Daniel
