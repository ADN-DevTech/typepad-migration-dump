  body: 'Hi Ronald,


    What do you mean by "not supplied any longer by Autodesk"? We still provide the
    COM Interop assemblies as part of the ObjectARX SDK. We just stopped installing
    them in the GAC as of AutoCAD 2013. You just need to reference the versions from
    the ObjectARX SDK and turn on type embedding for your project.


    Cheers,


    Stephen
