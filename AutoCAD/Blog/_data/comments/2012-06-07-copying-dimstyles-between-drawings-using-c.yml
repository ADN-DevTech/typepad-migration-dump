  body: 'Stephen,


    1. I see that the drawing in which the styles are copied (destDb) is opened in
    AutoCAD. Is it essential? Can we do it silently by opening its database with RealDwg?
    It should be possible since we are not creating any geometry in destDb.


    2. This is not really directly connected to AutoCAD but with VB, still I''ll ask
    it.


    Does it make any difference if ''db'' is already being used by another process
    not started through VB and hence not using ''System.IO.FileShare.Read'' (say manually).


    In other words, does the db have to be opened using ''System.IO.FileShare.Read''
    and only then can be shared by other processes?


    Of course I can try it and find out. But if you already know ......
