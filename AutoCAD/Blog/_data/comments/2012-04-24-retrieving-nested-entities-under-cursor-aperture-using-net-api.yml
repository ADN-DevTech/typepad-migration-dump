  body: "I noticed you used \"acad.exe\" in the PInvoke.  \n\nWith 2013, we seem to\

    \ know when to use \"acad.exe\" and \"AcCore.dll\"  (other than trial and error)?"

  body: 'Yes that''s a good point. With the introduction of AcCore.dll some exported
    arx methods may be moved to it whereas some others remains in acad.exe.

    I don''t have the list of all methods that will be moved to AcCore.dll, however
    it is pretty straightforward to discover them with a tool such as "depends.exe":
    simply open AcCore.dll from your AutoCAD install directory using this utility,
    you will see all exported methods it contains. It has an option to copy the methods
    names, so you can easily put them in a text file and perform a keyword search
    for example.

    Depends is a free tool available here: <a href="http://www.dependencywalker.com/">http://www.dependencywalker.com/</a>'

  body: 'I was musing about getting around the unsafe keyword in this example by changing
    the extern declaration of acadSSNameX from resbuf** rbpp to out IntPtr rbpp (cf.
    acedInvoke), and about using the predefined global::AdsName struct.

  body: 'I don''t know if commenting on a 2 year old post is clever, but I thought
    it is important to mention:


    I just implemented (using AutoCAD 2010) a "virtual selection" by using the PromptNestedEntityOptions''
    members "NonInteractivePickPoint" and "UseNonInteractivePickPoint". I actually
    did not use it for a "continuing realtime" but used the PromptNestedEntityResult''
    member PickedPoint. But without the need of any additionally imported functions.


    At another point of my software I "translated" the system''s cursor position to
    AutoCAD Point3d using the Editor.PointToWorld() function - which you did not need
    here because the PointMonitor already supplies the RawPoint. I just wanted to
    mention it. :)
