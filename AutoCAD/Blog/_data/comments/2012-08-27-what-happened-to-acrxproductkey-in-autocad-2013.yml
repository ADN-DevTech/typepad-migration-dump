  body: 'Hi Fenton. Can you offer an explaination as to why acrxProductKey() was not
    retained in the interest of source code portability across releases?


    Code portability between releases has become a major issue for many, include some
    who don''t think the relative handful of MAC users justifies what is happening,
    and that could have something to do with Autodesk''s recent financial performance,
    as customers (especially in Europe where customization is actually much more prevalent
    than it is here in the states) are really starting to get fed up with the seemingly-whimsical
    breaking changes, and just to be perfectly clear, let''s not confused confuse
    ''binary compatibility'' with source code portability.'

    I understand your pain... .


    Actually, the Mac port was a major milestone in AutoCAD''s history. Whether you
    use the Mac or not, the fact still remains that the changes implemented for the
    Mac platform brought us the ''headless'' AutoCAD (accoreconsole.exe). As a Windows
    AutoCAD programmer, this single change has opened the door for lots of awesome
    programming opportunities!


    About the acrxProductKey() - because of major architectural changes to core AutoCAD,
    this function was substituted with the more aptly named host application services
    version.'

    \nDoes it mean getUserRegistryProductRootKey()? \n\nOr \n\ndoes it mean getMachineRegistryProductRootKey()?\

    I took these to be the same.  Has this been split into two functions now?  If
    so, existing code is actually broken and should be revisited...'

    Fenton,

    Someone really needs to look at the ARX documentation.


    acrxProductKey is still listed in both arxRef.chm and arxDev.chm

    //------------

    John,

    from help AcDbHostApplicationServices::getMachineRegistryProductRootKey Method

    [quote]Returns the registry root of the product in the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE hive.
    In case of AutoCAD, the string returned is the same as the one returned by getUserProductRegistryRootKey.[/quote]




    Regards

    Kerry'
