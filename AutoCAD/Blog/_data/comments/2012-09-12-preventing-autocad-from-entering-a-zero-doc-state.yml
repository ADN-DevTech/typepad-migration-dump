  body: 'On second thought... what possible legitimate reason can there be to prevent
    AutoCAD from entering zero-document state?


    "When AutoCAD is in a zero document state, you have very limited access to AutoCAD''s
    functionality"..


    That is kind of like saying "when you park your car and turn off the ignition,
    you have very limited access to your car''s functionality".


    Duh'

  body: 'Tony - The analogy you used answers your own question, so I''m not sure the
    reason for your ''duh''. And this is a question that is frequently asked by ADN
    partners, so many people clearly do want this behavior.


    Its very kind of you to pop onto this blog occasionally to give us the benefit
    of your knowledge - our whole community benefits if we all share with each other
    - but please keep your comments constructive when you do visit. If you can''t
    post a comment without being condescending, then please don''t post comments.'

  body: 'ADN partners that don''t understand why preventing AutoCAD from entering
    a zero-document state is not not a legitimate requirement which they shouldn''t
    do, should be made to understand why, rather than thoughtlessly accommodated,
    without regards for whether the need is legitimate and/or interferes with the
    normal intended use of the product.


    If a user closes all open documents, they did it for a reason. If the ADN partner
    doesn''t know how to display their own UI in zero-document state (which is usually
    the reason why they want to prevent the user from getting there) then they should
    be shown how to do that, rather than shown how to implement a kludge that interferes
    with the normal use of the product, and the use of other extensions that may display
    a different UI when AutoCAD enters zero-document state.'

  body: Thank you for expanding on your previous comment, Tony. I agree that its always
    important to understand the underlying reason why someone is asking for a specific
    functionality. But we'll have to agree to disagree on the 'legitimacy' of this
    one. We have a large community of programmers who customize AutoCAD for many reasons,
    and in very different environments. They know what they and their customers want
    and need - not us. To say its 'not a legitimate requirement' is using too broad
    a brush. A reductio ad absurdum of this is that any AutoCAD customization changes
    the behavior some AutoCAD user has come to expect, ergo all customization is illegitimate.

  body: The solution posted crashes AutoCAD when the QUIT command is used, which I
    believe does qualify as interference.

  body: Thank you Tony. My previous responses were to your second comment - I hadn't
    referred to your first comment until now. It appears that you now accept that
    this is a legitimate use case, and your only beef is that Viru didn't explicitly
    demonstrate in this post how an exiting app should clean up an event handler it
    has registered. That's not surprising, as this blog is mostly focused on code
    snippets rather than full-blown apps - we don't cover every caveat in every post.
    But it is a good suggestion for a future post - probably after we've finished
    with AU and our Developer Days conferences - and I'm sure Viru will address the
    specific point for this post now you've raised it (and once he returns from vacation).
