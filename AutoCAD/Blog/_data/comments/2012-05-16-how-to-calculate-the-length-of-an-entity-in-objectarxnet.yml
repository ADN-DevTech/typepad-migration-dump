  body: 'Hi Petcon,


    I am guessing acdbOpenObject caused you some heart burn. I sympathise. Programming
    is hard.


    The point of the code above was to convey how to determine the length of a curve
    based entity and in that context the mistake you point to does not seem all that
    huge.


    Bullet proof code makes for some very unreadable prose and this leads to some
    reluctant compromises in favor of simplicity and readability.

    But I can always strive better.

    Cheers

    Gopinath'
