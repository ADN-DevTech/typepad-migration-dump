  body: "Hi there, \n\nyou seem to be a specialist for Real DWG. \nAt the moment we\
    \ are a bit confused about \"Real DWG\" and \"Inventor DWG\" (and so seems Autodesk\
    \ sometimes). \n\n\n\nTechsoft 3D: \"RealDWG will read all Autodesk generated\
    \ DWG files\"\n\nAutodesk support: \"Inventor DWG is not a Real DWG. You need\
    \ to export from Inventor to AutoCAD DWG format\".\n\nIs it possible to read Inventor\
    \ DWG with Real DWG API?"
