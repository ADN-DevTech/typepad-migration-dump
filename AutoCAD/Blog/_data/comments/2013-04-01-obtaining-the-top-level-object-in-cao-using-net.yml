    A basic introduction. Wait a more useful example, perhaps the example "caotest.dvb"
    converted to C #. NET and logical with enhancements.Example that should be tested
    and working properly.

    It seems to me that the library "CAO" was forgotten. It''s hard to find any example
    in fruitful .NET.

    Anyway thank you.'

    The example that is attached to the product has not been updated for years, who
    works with MDB? And with the troubles of 64BIT, there is no example that is written
    in C# and that works.

    Another problem, that internally, the software copies the entire table to an internal
    table that is saved in a file. DataTable

    And most importantly, internally they are probably based on OLEDB which is a bit
    problematic in Net8
