  body: 'Hi, Balaji!

    You forgot to remind that in this form, this code will only work in AutoCAD English,
    but not in localized versions of AutoCAD.'

  body: 'Thank you Alexander.

    You are right, this code will only work in the English version of AutoCAD. I only
    have English version installed in my system, so I can''t test the changes that
    might be required for it to work in other language versions, but I guess it will
    work if we use the global names such as "_.SELECT", "_.CMDNAMES" and "_P". Any
    additional inputs that you can provide will surely help readers of this blog who
    will want to use this code in localized versions of AutoCAD. Thank you.'
