  body: 'Hi Balaji,


    What would be the purpose of the Non Dwg window for CAD? I see a user could input
    some parameters here and then I assume this would auto draw an object in a new
    drawing - Is that the purpose of this? I am understanding this correctly?

  body: "Hi Steve,\n\nThe sample project accepts an input in a Non-Dwg window only\
    \ to demonstrate the access of the document associated with the Non-DWG document\
    \ window. Accepting inputs is not the sole purpose of the feature.\n\nI would\
    \ leave it to the application developers to identify how this feature can help\
    \ improve their end-user experience.\n\nThe possibilities are many - For example,\
    \ \n\n- A Non-DWG document window could show a table of standard pipe fittings\
    \ that the user can quickly refer while working on a drawing.\n\n- Display custom\
    \ graphics to show a Finite element analysis results \n\n- Play a short video\
    \ tutorial in a Non-DWG document window which may help with the current task that\
    \ the user is trying.\n\netc.\n\nMy thoughts may be quite limited and application\
    \ developers can better identify its use in their domain / workflow.\n\nRegards,\n\

    How can you know that a Document object is a non-DWG Document using .NET?


    Thanks.'

  body: "Hi Oscar,\n\nA document retrieved from any document window when successfully\
    \ typecast as \"Document\" would be a regular drawing window. \n\nNon-DWG document\

  body: 'Hi Balaji,


    Have you tried this example in AutoCAD 2016? I''ve encountered a problem when
    STARTMODE = 1, and you close AutoCAD with the window still open. AutoCAD hangs
    and i have to kill acad.exe process from the task manager. When STARTMODE = 0
    the problem goes away.


    Is this a known issue?
