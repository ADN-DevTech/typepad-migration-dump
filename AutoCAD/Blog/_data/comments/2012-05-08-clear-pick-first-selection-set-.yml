    I am Vietnammese. Sorry for my English.

    I have just been beginning with objectARX. I have some issues. Could you help
    me?

    They are,

    1. I have some polygons. when I click on an area, how can I know the area belongs
    to polygons? Which polygon?

    2. How can I save a list of selected lines to be able to delete some lines in
    the list from a chose polygon? How about property ObjectId?

    3. Can I detect all derived cycles with lines?


    Thank you very much!

    Best regards.'

    I want the functionality like , when we select any dimension of drawing , and
    click on  "Add Balloon" command button, it should do numbering of the dimensions
    in Multileader, like 1,2,3 ... in continuous ascending order and should do grouping
    of the dimension and its multileader numbering balloon.
