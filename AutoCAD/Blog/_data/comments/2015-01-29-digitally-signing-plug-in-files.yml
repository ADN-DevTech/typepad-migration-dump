    What''s the proper way to sign VLX files? It seems that AcSignApply.exe will sign
    these files and they seemingly run in AutoCAD 2016, but these signed files will
    fall into an infinite loop when used in an earlier version of AutoCAD. Is the
    solution to have a signed VLX for 2016+ and an unsigned for 2015-?'

    \ You need to have 2 versions vlx file (signed and unsigned)\n\nregards\nViru\
