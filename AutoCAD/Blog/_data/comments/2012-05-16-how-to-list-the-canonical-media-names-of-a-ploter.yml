    I have a question why it was necessary to open db.PlotSettingsDictionaryId with
    OpenMode.ForWrite. Can be enough OpenMode.ForRead?'

  body: 'Hello,


    I tried to use this code as reference, but I am still having the same issue.


    I have a pc3 file with a filtered list of paper sizes, but the GetCanonicalMediaNameList()
    returns all possible paper sizes.


    Is there a way to use this API to return only the filtered paper sizes (filtered
    in the same way as  in the plot dialog)?


    Regards,

    Jason Booth'
