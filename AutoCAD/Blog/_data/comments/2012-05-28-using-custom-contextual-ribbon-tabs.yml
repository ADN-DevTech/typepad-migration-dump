    Thank you for this good post.


    Is there a way to embed the ContextualTabSelectorRules.xaml and Helper.dll files
    in the CUIx? It is not always easy to put into the installation folder...


    Regards,

    Jonathan'

  body: 'Hello Adam,


    has the reference Assembly to be placed in the Programfoder?

    In my scenario I have an Autoloaded plugin including a cuix for my Tabs (Since
    custom WPF-Controls I had to go the way, althought I didn''t want to use CUI...).
    Currently I load them by impliedselectionchanged event (certain Blockref''s selected
    -> Tab visible). It could be easier (and maybe more safe - object editing in an
    active Event...) to activate the Tabs Contextually by rules. But if I read this
    correctly, I had to place my whole Plugin in the Programfolder, which I''m not
    comfortable with.


    Best Regards,

    I would have not known the answer off the top of my head. Haven''t played with
    this thing for quite some time. :)
