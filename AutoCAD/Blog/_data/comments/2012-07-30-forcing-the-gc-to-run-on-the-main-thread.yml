  body: The internal product is slowly turning multi-threaded, however, it won't be
    available to access through the API's for a long time to come. This is because
    it's such a huge code base.

    In a way, this isn''t a bad news, if core acad turns multi-threaded (even slowly),
    we''ll get those threads for free!

  body: '" Therefore, I recommend you Dispose() all AutoCAD .NET objects using the
    .NET ''using'' statement – that way you are not relying on the GC to clean up

    Sorry, I must be missing something here.


    I thought the whole point to writing code that runs in a ''managed'' execution
    environment, was so that the programmer could rely on the GC to clean up after
    themself, and offload tasks that C/C++ programmers must routinely do manually
    (e.g, free memory and call d''tors) or with the help of smart pointers.


    When we write managed code, we are *always* relying on the GC to clean up the
    managed objects we create and use (whether they implement IDisposable or not),
    and we do not need to be concerned with deallocating those objects or the memory
    they consume, calling d''tors, etc.


    Given that, I''m somewhat bewildered by your statement, and you can read more
    about that here:your advice:

  body: "Hey Pseudonym\n\nActually, I think you misunderstood what I said... \n\n\
    I do mention at the end of that sentence \"to cleanup after yourself\" - meaning,\
    \ that you should clean up *YOUR* objects not AutoCAD's. \n\nI noted your comments\
    \ on the link you posted and I really think it's fairly obvious that you should\
    \ not dispose of master property objects such as MdiActiveDocument? As common\
    \ in any computer language, you don't dispose/delete/free objects that are not\
    \ under your control. \n\nYes .NET is super cool, but you should still think about\
    \ what you are doing a bit. Also, the bottom like is that the AutoCAD .NET API\
    \ wraps ObjectARX, that means you absolutely cannot rely on the GC to Dispose\
    \ AutoCAD Database objects, and, you shouldn't rely on the GC to Dispose all other\
    \ AutoCAD .NET classes. \n\nThanks for pointing this out though, I appreciate\
    \ your comments. Keep them coming!"

    Well in that case, I don''t think I''m alone in that regards.
