  body: 'Iterating through the AttributeReference collection will miss the Constant
    Attributes, they are  only in the block definition, not in the BlockReference.AttributeCollection.
    You will get the constant Attribute definitions when you explode the block but
    they are not added to toAddColl when you iterate the AttributeReferences and they
    are not added to it after you explode the block.


    Also "Then Else"? Is that an empty "Then" clause instead of a "Not"?'

  body: 'Thanks CAD bloke and Alex


    I have updated the code to consider constant and invisible attributes and switched
    over to C# as the blog post formatting made it difficult to copy the code directly.
