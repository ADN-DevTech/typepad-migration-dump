  body: Philippe can this be done without actually appending the entity to the drawing
    first?  I want to create an in-memory 3D solid that is then passed into the HLR
    (hidden line removal tool in the utilities of the ObjectARX API) so we can get
    2D projections of the filleted solid. I do not need a DWG resident instance of
    the solid.  It could be added it and erased it but that adds to the undo list
    unnecessarily.

  body: "Hi George, I doubt it's possible: the solid needs to be database resident\
    \ in order to have its subentity path affected. \n\nYou can turn off the undo\
    \ mechanism using Database.DisableUndoRecording as a workaround.\n\nHope that\
    \ helps,\nPhilippe.\n-----"
