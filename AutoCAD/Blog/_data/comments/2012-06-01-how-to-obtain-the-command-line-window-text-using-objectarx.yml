  body: 'Hi Fenton,


    I am trying to p/invoke this from .NET, but I get different handles depending
    on how I access the text window, as follows:


    a) First I P/Invoked acedGetAcadTextCmdLine() as per this post, but no children
    are found.


    b) Second I showed the text window (i.e. ran TEXTSCR) and then P/Invoked the user32
    GetForegroundWindow() method. With this I could access the children as per your
    code.


    Do you know why I get different window handle pointers?
