    "These Parameter values are defined as double values, ranging from 0.0 to n."
    that''s not true for arcs, ellipse arc etc.

  body: 'I nominate this post for the hall of shame. The internet is awash in misinformation
    and incorrect or sloppy code samples using curve parameters, but I expect you
    guys at Autodesk to clean things up, not make them worse. This is now the second
    post on this blog that presents almost identical incorrect code, as if to reinforce
    the first post on the subject.


    As Gaston says, you can never assume that the start parameter is 0.0, even for
    AcDbLine and other core entities. Also, it is never safe to assume that a midpoint
    is halfway between the parameters of the endpoints. The correct way to calculate
    a midpoint is by first calculating the average of the distances at each endpoint,
    then finding the point at that distance.
