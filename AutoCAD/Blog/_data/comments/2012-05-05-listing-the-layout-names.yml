  body: 'hello, for the .net part of listing the names... iterating throught the layoutDictionary
    the DBDictionaryentry.Key already holds the Name of the Layout. Is there a particular
    reason to open the Layout object itself for this purpose? Just wondering...

    (ACA 2014 - might be different in 2012)

    Yes, the key should do if you are only after the names.


    Thanks

    thanks for the feedback, just wanted to be sure, there are no backdrafts :) I
    only need the names in my current situation.

    Do you know of any way to get the list of layouts in the order the tabs are shown
    on-screen?

    (eg) Layout1, Layout2, Layout10, Layout11


    Autocad appears to return them in this order from this code:

    Layout1, Layout10, Layout11, Layout2


    Thanks!

    Chris.'

    Sorry for the delay in getting back to you.


    The layout''s tab order property should let you know that info.
