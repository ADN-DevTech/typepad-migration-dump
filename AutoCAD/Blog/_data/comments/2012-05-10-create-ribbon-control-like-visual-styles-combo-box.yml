  body: 'Hi there,


    As you can see in the above example you actually need to create a RibbonGallery
    with ComboBox display mode to create a control that looks and behave like a combo
    box. I seem to remember that it''s not suggested to use the ComboBox class, but
    I could be wrong.

    Any reason why you do not want to use the RibbonGallery control?

    .NET API but I couldn´t find the way to do that. With ObjectARX I can do that
    using COM API but not using .NET API. I can also be wrong about that cause I have
    not yet found the way. =)

  body: "Hello Adam, \n\nI created some WPF Usercontrols (based on Fenton Webb's Performance\
    \ Gauges) and added successfully to my Project.\nIn fact I need the tabs as sort\
    \ of \"contextual\", by using the impliedselectionchanged event (had no better\
    \ idea to filter selection...) showing/hiding them\n\nThe CUI-Loading in my case\
    \ is suboptimal (although I have no other option by now)\n\nSo the question is,\
    \ how to get the registered Ribboncomponent (HKLM...\\Ribboncontrols) programatically.\n\
    Tried (with others):\n\ndim rci as new Ribboncompositeitem (\"keyname as in resDic\"\
    )\ndim dt as windows.datatemplate (gettype (myUSERcontrol))\nci.content= dt.loadcontent\n\
    ...\n\nthis ci I was able to add to a PanelSource...\n\nactually I tried to rebuild\
    \ the \"XAML\" construct. with no luck (not surprised)\n\nOK, I think the control\
    \ shall be \"loaded\" anyway by the time I want to access it via my plugin so\
    \ I needed to find a collection, where I could grab it from, or so.\n\nI may be\
    \ complete wrong on this...:(\n\nI guess Acad is somewhere aware of the Components\
    \ (since I can access them via CUI-Editor) I just did not find out the right way,\
    \ to use them programatically (Fenton wrote in his Au-Paper (CP114-5, 2009) that\
    \ \"x:UID\" shall used to get the control, but I had no luck so far).\n\nMy goal\
    \ was to create some Ribbontabs, containing Usercontrols which I can manipulate\
    \ then in the way your Code does here with \"standard items\" (meaning objects\
    \ provided by autodesk.Windows namespace)\n\nThanks in advance!\nDaniel"

  body: "Hi Daniel,\n\nSorry for the delay. There was an issue posting comments in\
    \ the blog. \n\nIf you have access to the xaml file, then it can be directly loaded\
    \ in the ribbon panel as one of the item.\n\nHere is a sample code :\n\n<code>\n\
    Uri uri = new Uri(\"/RibbonCustCtrlDataBinding;component/MyRibbonControl.xaml\"\
    , System.UriKind.Relative);\nResourceDictionary resDict = (ResourceDictionary)System.Windows.Application.LoadComponent(uri);\n\
    ribSourcePanel.Items.Add((RibbonItem)resDict[\"ribbonCompositeItemKey\"]);\n</code>\n\
    \nIn this code the \"ribbonCompositeItemKey\" is the value specified in your xaml\
    \ file as x:Key.\n\nYou can refer to the xaml file from the WPF webcast by my\
    \ colleague Fenton Webb.\n\nAlso, you may be interested in this Devblog post that\
    \ explains the way to create a contextual ribbon tab using the ribbon runtime\
    \ API.\n\n<a href=\"http://adndevblog.typepad.com/autocad/2012/04/displaying-a-contextual-tab-upon-entity-selection-using-ribbon-runtime-api.html\"\
