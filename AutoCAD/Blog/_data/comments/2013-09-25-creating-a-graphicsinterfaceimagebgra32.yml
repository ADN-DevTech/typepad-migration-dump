  body: Is there a way to control the quality? I see that there is an enum Autodesk.AutoCAD.GraphicsSystem.Quality
    but I don't know how to use. With Geometry.Image, my image is drawn in LowQuality.

  body: 'Hi Maxence,


    I am not sure if this will improve the quality in case of a image drawn by a custom
    entity as I haven''t tried it. To use this, please follow a code similar to the
    one explained in this blog post :

    <a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/autocad/2012/07/api-for-3dconfig.html">http://adndevblog.typepad.com/autocad/2012/07/api-for-3dconfig.html</a>


    AcGsConfig is a singleton class, so you may want to set it globally through a
    command.


    Regards,
