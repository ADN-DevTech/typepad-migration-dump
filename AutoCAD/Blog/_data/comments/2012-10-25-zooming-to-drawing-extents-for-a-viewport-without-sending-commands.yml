  body: "Dear Sir,\n\nI have one question. I am trying to show only some entities\
    \ in AcDbViewport. In my model I have several entities and I need to create new\
    \ AcDbLayout that will display only some entities, not all. I have command that\
    \ creates new AcDbLayout. Then I tried to manipulate with AcDbLayout::database(),\
    \ to remove Ids of those entities that shouldn't be displayed, but it seems that\
    \ I can't do it this way? Then I tried to use this code, just to change AcDbViewport\
    \ dimensions so it will show only entities that I want. I calculated their rectangular\
    \ window in Model space and tried to set AcDbViewport to show only that. I set\
    \ viewport's ViewCenter and ViewHeight to center and height of that rectangle\
    \ but it didn't work. It seems like AutoCad automatically changed them so all\
    \ entities could be displayed? \nCould you tell me is there any way to show only\
    \ entities that I want to display?"

  body: 'Hi Nenad,


    You can try assigning different layers for the entities that you want shown /
    hidden and then use freeze layer specific to a viewport. Please try the code in
    this blog post :
