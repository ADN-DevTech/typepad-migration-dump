    \ video, I took a look at <a href=\"http://www.autocadws.com/jsapi/v1/docs/Acad_Application.html.\"\
    >http://www.autocadws.com/jsapi/v1/docs/Acad_Application.html.</a> An very interesting\
    \ thing is that classes in the document have no details, just a constructor, such\
    \ as \"Acad.Vector2d\". \n\nWithout member methods, how could we use them? Could\
    \ you explain this?"

  body: "Hi Jeff,\n\nThanks for your interest in the JavaScript API. Make sure you\
    \ scroll down the page, so the documentation link you mentioned does have a description\
    \ of the properties for each object. Talking about Acad.Vector2d, here is what\
    \ I can see:\n\nName:  x \nType: Number \nDescription:  Returns the X property\
    \ value \nCondition:  Read-write \n\nName:  y\nType: Number \nDescription:  Returns\
    \ the Y property value \nCondition:  Read-write \n\nI hope it helps,\nPhilippe."

    Take the Vector2d as the example, I know that there are X and Y properties. However,
    there is no methods, like rotation, dotProduct, crossProduct etc, which are available
    in ARX''s AcGeVector2d documentation.


    Thanks.'

  body: "The 2014 version of the JavaScript API has to be considered as a \"tech-preview\"\
    . The real v1.0 should be released in the next version of AutoCAD. \n\nIt is however\
    \ in no point the equivalent or a replacement for the powerful ARX API. \n\nAcad.Vector2d\
    \ has no methods, it's simply a structure holding X,Y coordinates. If needed,\
    \ methods should be implemented on your own.\n\nTo get an idea about what is doable\
    \ at the moment using JS, take a look at the samples coming along, they are pretty\
    \ exhaustive in term of functionality. You can also extend the JS API using .Net\
    \ or ARX also as illustrated in that material.\n\nI hope it clarifies thing a\
    \ bit."

    Could you briefly describe how can I create a command as ADNJSdemo?

  body: 'I don''t think you can do this from the JavaScript API, you would need to
    use the C++ or .Net API inside AutoCAD to achieve that. Getting the vertices from
    .Net is fairly straightforward: <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2007/04/iterating_throu.html">http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2007/04/iterating_throu.html</a>


    You could load a custom .Net dll in AutoCAD that expose a toolkit of features
    and invoke that from js. There is an example in that material that illustrates
    calling .net from js.


    Hope that helps

    I''m having some issues to get AcHTML running. For now I''ve created the ACHTML.dll
    file with Visual Studio 2012, 4.5 .NET. Running it with AutoCAD 2016.

    I can load the .dll into AutoCAD and I can also open the html file with the adnjsdemo
    command, as i.e. the DBReactors.html. From there on the window opens in autocad,
    but I cannot Add Listeners or anything else. Also tried all the other html examples.
    Do I still have to add a javascript loader or anything else? It seems, that the
    html file cannot call the .js files.


    Many thanks in advance,

    Athanasius'
