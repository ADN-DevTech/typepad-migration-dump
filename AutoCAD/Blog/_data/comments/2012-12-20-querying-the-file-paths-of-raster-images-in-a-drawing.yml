  body: 'I''m currently researching if I can somehow programmatically change the path
    to raster images in thousands of drawings because we''re wanting to restructure
    our folders on the network.  It world be great if I can simply change the path
    property (Found At and/or Saved At) but if that''s not possible then plan B is
    to collect enough info from the AcDbRasterImageDef and AcadRasterImage objects,
    detach it, copy the image file to the new location then attach it from the new
    location using the info collected. I''m hoping someone can shed some light, thank
    you.
