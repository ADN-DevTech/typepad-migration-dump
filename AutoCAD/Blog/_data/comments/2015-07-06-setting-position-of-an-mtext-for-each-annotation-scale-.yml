  body: 'Why they do not give access to the annotation scale info?


    I have some (plenty) drawings where the annotative position of block attributes
    have been set to a wrong z values (how? I really do not know how draughtsmen have
    made this...).


    I have tried with .net, VBA or ObjectARX to get access to the position points
    for each scale and set their z to zero for all but it does not seem to be available.
