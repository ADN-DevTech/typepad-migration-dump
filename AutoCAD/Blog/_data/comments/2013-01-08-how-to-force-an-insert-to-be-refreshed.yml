    I''m not sure that''s the ''fastest'' way. :d


    You can open the AcDbBlockTableRecord for the block whose insertions you want
    to refresh, and call getBlockReferenceIds( false, true ) to get an array of the
    ids of all insertions of the block, and all insertions of all dependent blocks,
    then open each of them for write and call assertWriteEnabled().


    You should also call acdbForceOpenObjectOnLockedLayer() before opening each insertion
    if it''s on a locked layer.
