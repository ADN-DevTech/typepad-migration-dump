  body: 'An alternative to avoid creating a control seems to be SynchronizationContext.
    There is a nice article here: <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/31971/Understanding-SynchronizationContext-Part-I">http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/31971/Understanding-SynchronizationContext-Part-I</a>'

  body: 'Lots of thanks for this post, helped me build an actually user-friendly integrated
    file synchronisation tool.


    The SynchronizationContext turned out to be quite useful because it gives the
    choice between synchronous and asynchronous calls, but it also creates a new problem:
    by default, the main thread''s SynchronizationContext.Current is null. Creating
    a Control, much like in the example, solved this problem.
