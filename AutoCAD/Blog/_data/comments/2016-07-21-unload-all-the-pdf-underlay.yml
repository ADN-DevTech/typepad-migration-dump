    You wrote: "It is required to remove corresponding PDF underlay references from
    the drawing".

    But in your''s code there are not any removing of PDFReference''s (e.g.  pdfref.Erase()
    ). Only "regen" of PDFReference''s.

    As far as I see it is enough in order to hide it in drawing: <a href="http://autode.sk/2axfW7G">http://autode.sk/2axfW7G</a>'
