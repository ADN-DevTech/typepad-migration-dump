  body: 'The ESC function needs updating. In current versions of Civil 3D if your
    cursor is in the drawing area (cross-hairs active) and you hit Esc it will cancel
    a command or deselect as it is supposed to and then often the cross-hairs are
    replaced by a mouse cursor. Presumably as some tool palette or other UI element
    is activated.


    The other associated problem is constantly starting a crossing window just because
    you are clicking to [re-]activate the drawing window. All you are doing is trying
    to activate the cross-hairs so you can do something or type a command so it changes
    the mouse from an arrow to the cross-hairs and starts a crossing window all in
    one click which it should not do.
