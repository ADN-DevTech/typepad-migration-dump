  body: you can use DynamicBlockTableRecord even if it's not the anonymous version
    of the dynamic block, so the check for block.IsAnonymous is redundant

  body: '“IsAnonymous” required, AutoCAD creates a “Anonymous” block once user modifies
    the dynamic block reference. In that case we need to use “DynamicBlockTableRecord”
    to get the real block name.

  body: "what i meant is thet every dynamic block reference has the property DynamicBlockTableRecord,\
    \ even if it was not modified\nyou already test if the block is dynamic, so if\
    \ it's true, just take the DynamicBlockTableRecord\n\nif (blockRef.IsDynamicBlock)\n\
    {\n   block = tx.GetObject(blockRef.DynamicBlockTableRecord,\n               \
    \         OpenMode.ForRead) as blockTableRecord;\n            }\n        else\n\
    \        {\n            block = tx.GetObject(blockRef.BlockTableRecord,\n    \

  body: "I'm finding something similar.  I can't call IsDynamicBlock and get true\
    \ for a dynamic block.  If I go ahead and get the BlockTableRecord via DynamicBlockTableRecord\
    \ the BTR tells me that it's dynamic and then I can get the name of it.  IsDynamic\
    \ on the BlockRecord doesn't seem to give the correct information.  \nMust be\
    \ something that I'm not understanding?"
