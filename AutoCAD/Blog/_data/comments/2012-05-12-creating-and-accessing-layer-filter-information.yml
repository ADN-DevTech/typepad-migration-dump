    How can I get layerId collection for each layerFilter?


    LayerGroup has method "LayerIds" but that method doesn´t exist in LayerFilter.


    Thank you.'

    You must closed the Layer manager windowform, then open it again , then you will
    see the new layerfiter just created.


    if you don''t close and open it . you will not see the layerfiter .
