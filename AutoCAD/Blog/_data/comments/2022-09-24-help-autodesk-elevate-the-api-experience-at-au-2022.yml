  body: How do YOU design YOUR APIs when constructing automations, workflows, plugins,
    add-ons, and cloud-services? Tell me about the resources you rely on. What additional
    tools or resources would you most want to have at your disposal?

  body: I'd suggest keeping an open forum etc. where people can gripe about APIs..........there
    are many problem points / points of contention when using AutoDesk products -
    which involves not just the APIs, but the entire process from buying the software,
    to getting it installed, to troubleshooting, to documentation. And then come the
    APIs....The issue is - writing / communicating painpoints with APIs takes time,
    and requires some creativity / intellectual ability..............my feeling is
    that AutoDesk doesn't bother fixing these problems, let alone reading or understand
    them - whether this is actually the case or not is completely immatieral - it
    is difficult for me to to invest time, only to know that there is a 99% probability
    it will be filed away in the proverbial circular file. my two cents.
