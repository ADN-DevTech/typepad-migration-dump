  body: 'Very useful article... definitely saving this.


    Given the string:

    \pi0.1122;Composite\P\pi0.33077;C01\P\pi0.28018;0,0,0\P\pi0.19922;000000\P\pi0.2822;white

    How do I interpret the "\pi0.11222;"? I know that it is a centered mtext sub-string
    (because that''s what I created), but don''t see out to infer that from the dxf.


    Can you offer any help?
