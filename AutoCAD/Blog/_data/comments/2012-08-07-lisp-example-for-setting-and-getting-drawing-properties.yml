  body: 'How do you retrieve the "Text Custom" (custom field) and save that value
    to a user defined variable? (For example: I want to set the FLOOR_LEVEL in the
    custom field (example:"02" for the second floor) and then have my routine pull
    that "string" number as a strcat to add other info in that will be placed as text
    in the drawing. This routine will be ran several times so I don''t want to have
    to keep typing it in, and in several different drawings so I want the value stored
    in the file rather that the lisp. Thank you in advance.'
