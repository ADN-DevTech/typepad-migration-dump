  body: 'I''m trying to use this to disallow dragging of my custom objects, but I
    don''t necessarily want to override the default drag-and-drop action of AutoCAD.
    Similarly, I don''t want to try and re-implement AutoCAD''s default behaviour.
    Is there a way to prevent my objects from being dragged whilst leaving the standard
    drag-drop behaviour intact?
