  body: "OK, you can also use Amazon if you prefer :) \n\nIf you are asking why we\
    \ need to use cloud, I would say, it depends on your requirement. For example,\
    \ you may have many clients working on the same drawing from different devices(PC,\
    \ Pad, Cellphone...), from different places, at different time, a cloud based\
    \ solution would be suitable for this case. I probably will write another post\
    \ about the scenarios of cloud latter. \n-----"
