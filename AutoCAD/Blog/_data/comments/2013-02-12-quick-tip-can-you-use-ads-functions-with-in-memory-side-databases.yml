    database that contains the objects used with ads-style APIs often works.


    As a matter of fact, it even works for acedSSGet("X"), with the caveat that it
    sets the "Previous" selection set, so you have to get rid of that before returning
    control to the user.'

  body: 'Hi Tony,


    "often" is a dangerous word. As I mentioned, these functions are not intended
    to work with non-current databases. If it works, your lucky and if I does not,
    then "I told you so" applies.


    If you do want to switch working databases, it is far more robust to switch documents
    itself (obtain the document associated with a database and use it) with AcApDocManager::setCurDocument.
    This takes care of setting the working database with the database associated with
    the document.


    Cheers
