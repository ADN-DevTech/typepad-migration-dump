  body: 'I have a 2015 dwg file where some layouts contains entities + viewports,
    but the GetVieports function gives me empty collection. Is this behaviour planed?


    Once you switch to a layout, GetVieports should return one viewport permanently.
    or am I wrong?'

  body: "You can not use Layout.GetViewports() to find if a layout is initialized\
    \ because it returns an empty collection if the layout has never been activated.\
    \ It is explained in the docs. \n\nYou can use Database.GetViewport(bGetPaperspaceVports:\
    \ true) to get all the viewports in the drawing. After that, you can find the\
    \ layout of each viewport: get the owner BlockTableRecord with viewport.BlockId,\
    \ then you have a property LayoutId which allow you to match the viewport to its\
    \ layout.\n-----"
