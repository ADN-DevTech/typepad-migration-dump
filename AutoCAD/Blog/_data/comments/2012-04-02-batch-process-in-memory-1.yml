    I''m curious why there is no mention of the db.CloseInput method in this post.
    Is this to ease the pains of files which were open for write by another instance
    of AutoCAD?'

    The CloseInput method is for internal use only, as mentioned on the documentation.
    If you have a scenario where the file is already opened, then this code may not
    work as changes are made to files...
