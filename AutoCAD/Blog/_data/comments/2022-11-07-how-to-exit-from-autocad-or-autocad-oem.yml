  body: You are absolutely right when an error occurs, instead of being confused,
    you should be calm to handle it. The other day when I was playing <a href="https://basketball-stars.io">basketball
    stars</a> on my computer, suddenly my screen went black then ran into strange
    words, I calmly restarted the computer, but in the end I still had to call the
    mechanic because it doesn't change anything.

  body: The acrx_abort() function is a safer way to abort AutoCAD than calling the
    exit() function directly. This is because acrx_abort() allows AutoCAD and other
    ObjectARX applications to recover as much work as possible before exiting.

  body: 'Great points about graceful shutdowns in AutoCAD, Madhukar! Important for
    data integrity. Reminds me, error handling in Papa''s Pizzeria is simpler – a
    burnt pizza just means lost revenue, not lost CAD data! Seriously though, always
    prioritize API calls for stability. Using AcDbHostApplicationServices::fatalError()
    sounds like the proper way to avoid catastrophic fails. Thanks for sharing!
