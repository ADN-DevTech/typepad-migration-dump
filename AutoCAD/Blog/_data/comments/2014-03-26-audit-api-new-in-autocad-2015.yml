    Could I be missing a dll reference, or using statement?


    I have Acad 2015 + the hotfix that came out this month

  body: Sorry for the necropost. Is there a way to get back the number of items fixed/found?
    Essentially I want a way to programmatically call Audit and get all the same text
    as when I run Audit manually in AutoCAD for logging purposes.

    You can get the text outputted to command line using becho variable (second bool)
    but i do not think you can get back the number of error fixed in terms of count.
