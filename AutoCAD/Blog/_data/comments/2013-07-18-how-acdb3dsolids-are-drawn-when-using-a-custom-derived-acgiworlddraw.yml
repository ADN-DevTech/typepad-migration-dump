  body: 'I see the shell example in ObjectARX SDK. We have to create the list of vertices
    and faces and send it to the shell api.


    As in block we can add comple solid using boolean operations, isn''t there any
    easy way to create complex 3D custom entity using boolean operation where we simple
    add 3D solid primitives and do boolean on them ?


    Is there any sample on similar path ?
