  body: This is nice to see Virupaksha, thanks for posting. Perhaps it would be nice
    to see most visited apps per product. AutoCAD apps will always be the top viewed
    because they show up in every product. The exchange store itself should have this
    differentiation as well - it's difficult to find a product specific app.

    >>it''s difficult to find a product specific app


    Could you elaborate on this? The Exchange website is already split into 16 different
    product specific stores. What would you like to be different to make it easier
    to find the apps you need?


    Cheers,
