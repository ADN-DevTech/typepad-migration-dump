    How do you know the US option when working in non-US AutoCAD? For command it''s
    easy. Click on button or ribbon, launches the US command, but within a command,
    option are translated, and it''s not always simple to find the US option.


    Thanks


    Olivier'

    Sorry for the delay in responding to your comment. I was on vacation last week.


    As you might already know, there is no way to switch the language of AutoCAD while
    it is running. So to find the US option, I can only think of the following ways
    :


    1) Refer to the English version of the documentation. For example : PLine documentation
    lists the various options in English : <a href="http://docs.autodesk.com/ACD/2010/ENU/AutoCAD%202010%20User%20Documentation/index.html?url=WS1a9193826455f5ffa23ce210c4a30acaf-48f7.htm,topicNumber=d0e290858">http://docs.autodesk.com/ACD/2010/ENU/AutoCAD%202010%20User%20Documentation/index.html?url=WS1a9193826455f5ffa23ce210c4a30acaf-48f7.htm,topicNumber=d0e290858</a>


    2) The other way could be to create a lauch shortcut with "/language en-US". This
    would launch the English version of AutoCAD which can be used to find the options.


    Thank you.'
