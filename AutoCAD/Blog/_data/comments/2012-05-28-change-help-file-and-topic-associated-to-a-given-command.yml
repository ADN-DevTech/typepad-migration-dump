  body: 'Hi Andrey,


    One thing I started wondering about was the cyrillic characters in the folder
    name. I created a folder named "C:\Рабочий стол", copied the acadauto.chm file
    there from "C:\Program Files\AutoCAD 2009\Help" folder and tried to use that,
    and then I could reproduce the problem that it was not taken into account and
    still the old help file popped up when I pressed F1 while the tooltip was showing.


    However, even if I just double-click on the chm file in Explorer it comes up with
    the error message:

    "Cannot open file: C:\??????? ????\acadauto.chm"

    So the error does not seem specific to AutoCAD but has to do with the help file
    (*.chm file) you are using.

    If I copied the access.chm file from "C:\Windows\Help" to this other folder I
    created, then both double-clicking it in Explorer worked fine and also using it
    in acedSetFunHelp worked fine:

    acedSetFunHelp("C:LINE", @"C:\Рабочий стол\access.chm", "AccessOptions_ct", 0);


    So you would need to find out how to make your chm file work in a folder with
    cyrillic (or I guess any other non-latin) characters in it, and then you could
    use that in acedSetFunHelp as well.


    I hope this helps.


    Cheers,

    Adam'

    Adam, which page must to open your code?

    acedSetFunHelp("C:LINE", "acad_acg.chm", "ACG.01.008", 0);

    Alwais opened usual help page for Line command. Even if instead of "acad_acg.chm",
    to "ACG.01.008" to specify another.'

    I thought about it problem and I have tried other variant:

    I copied myHelp.chm into "C:\Program Files\AutoCAD 2009\Help" but it ain''t working
    (was opened standard help info for Line command). I wrote it:


    acedSetFunHelp("C:LINE", "myHelp.chm", "plotting_layouts", 0);

    Could you please post this issue on the AutoCAD API forum?

    I hope someone already has run into this issue and can help you solve it.

    Good luck!'

    thank you for the post, its really helpful! I have tried it and it works great
    when the command is running or when the mouse is hovering over a ribbon button.

    I was wondering, is there a way to do the same for the toolbar buttons?'

    What about that LINE is not Autolisp-definded command and so you have to use not
    "C:LINE", but "LINE" in your''s code?
