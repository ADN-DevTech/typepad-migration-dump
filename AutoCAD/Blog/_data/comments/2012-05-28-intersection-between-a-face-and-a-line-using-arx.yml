  body: "Hi Philippe, \nI am using VBA in AutoCAD 2011, can you provide me same code\
    \ for VBA. I am intersecting a line with all available 3D faces and extending\
    \ to to the 3D face against which it intersects. Hope you got my point.\n\nThanks,\n\

  body: "Hi Sandip,\n\nSorry, it's hard for us to write code on an on-demand basis.\
    \ I don't have a VBA sample for the same. As you may know the ActiveX API is significantly\
    \ less powerful than ARX, so what's doable in ARX is not always in VBA. For example\
    \ ActiveX API has no AcGe transient entities, so it would make the first approach\
    \ impossible. You may want to try the second approach by creating solids, but\
    \ you will have to add entities to the database in order to be able to invoke\
    \ methods on it, I'm thinking you could try AcadSolid.IntersectWith...\n\nGood\
    \ luck! \n-----"
