    > Group plants persistent reactors on its entries when the entries are added to
    the group. To accomplish this, it must have an objectId. When the group is added
    to the group dictionary, it is also added to the database, and thus it obtains
    an objectId. Therefore, do not attempt to add entries to a newly created group
    before adding the group to the group dictionary.


    So be carefull, add the group to the dictionnary first before appending entities.
    And from my experience, entities must be closed.'
