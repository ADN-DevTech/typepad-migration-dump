  body: 'The 2 codes are not exactly equivalent. In the Lisp version you''re setting
    the ActiveSpace to model space and then obtaining the active viewport. This might
    not be the same viewport as selected if there''s more than one VP on the current
    layout. For that you have to ensure that the CVPort system variable matches the
    selected viewport''s index number (as in the 69 DXF code of the viewport).


    Unfortunately the ActiveX object doesn''t seem to have a property to the "Viewport
    ID". So you''d need the entget DXF list as well as the vla-object to go about
    it this route. In which case I think you could simply have used the XData in any
    case - quite easy to get at by adding the optional argument to entget to obtain
    xdata as well.


    Also there''s some error checking you do in the C++ version but not in Lisp. What
    if the user picks an empty spot, presses enter or picks an entity which is not
    a viewport?'

  body: "Hi Irné,\n\nThanks for your comments.\n\nBy \"equivalent code\", I did not\
    \ mean a 1:1 correspondence. Only the core idea of getting the zoom scale factor\
    \ remains.\n\nThe intention of the post is to demonstrate a way to get the zoom\
    \ scale factor and all surrounding error checks that might be needed to make it\
    \ complete is usally very limited.\n\nThere is usually very less/no error checking\
    \ in the code snippets that we post. \n-----"
