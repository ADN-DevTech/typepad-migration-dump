  body: 'Hi Fenton,


    I think I found a bug with your MgdDbg Tool bundle''s PackageContents.xml file.


    Works fine for me in 2013, but it doesn''t work for me in 2012. I narrowed the
    issue down to the first "RuntimeRequirements" element, the one that comes before
    any of the "Components" elements. If I set SeriesMax to R18.2 it works in 2012.
    I tried a bunch of settings, and basically anything up to R18.9 is ok, so is omitting
    this parameter altogether.


    Sorry to post this here but it seems your original post has been closed out. Thought
    you should know in case it is an internal implementation problem.

    was a SeriesMax hotfix. My bad, cheers :-)
