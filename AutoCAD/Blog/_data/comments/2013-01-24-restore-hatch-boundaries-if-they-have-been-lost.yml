  body: "Autocad has two methods to restore hatch boundaries. \nMethod 1. Select a\
    \ hatch, right click and select generate boundary (which runs the HatchGenerateBoundary\
    \ command).\n\nMethod 2. Select a hatch, on the ribbon, Hatch Editor context tab,\
    \ Boundaries panel, click Recreate, choose polyline or region, then yes or no\
    \ to associate the new boundary to the hatch."

    all of us are able to build / understand the ObjectARX API.

  body: 'Sorry René, we can''t convert every arx sample we post into .Net. The .Net
    API is mainly a wrapper around arx classes, so in most of the cases the member
    methods are pretty similar. As far as the class names are concerned, they are
    identical but without prefix in .Net: AcDbHatch -> Hatch, AcGePoint3d -> Point3d.'

  body: 'I have been trying to convert the sample to managed Net myself, but it seems
    that I''m missing some header files:


    acmemdebug.h

    gemetatp.h

    gegetmti.h

    dbidnln.h


    I have also tried asking ADN, CaseNo-08044841, but with no result.


    Thanks in any case.
