  body: 'Thanks for posting about Python scripts its been an interesting demo so far!
    Where do I find the .py files for the prebuilt equipment? in the .peqx files?
    all I can see is the .xmls and the images.


    I was hoping to use some of the existing equipment to see how custom ones should
    be built.'

  body: 'Nice script, I was looking for a decent expansion joint model. I have gotten
    it to work up to the point I can add the component to a Plant3D model, but the
    componentn does not seem to have any ports.


    Is there something wrong with the catalog definition, or is something missing
    from the script?'
