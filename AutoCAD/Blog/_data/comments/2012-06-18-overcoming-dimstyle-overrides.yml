  body: 'Could you please localize your variables? It''s considered extremely bad
    practice to use global variables exclusively. Unless you intend for them to be
    global - in which case the convention is to indicate them as such by prefixing
    & suffixing asterisks to their names. And in which case (for efficiency) you should
    check if they''re already assigned before simply assigning them again.


    And another thing: You set a variable to the acad-object, but only use it once
    in the routine. This is lisp not C++/VB/VBA, so you don''t need to do that - just
    wastes RAM for no reason.


    Other than that you do show a nice short method for updating Dim Styles from overrides!'
