  body: 'A reader of my book "Mastering AutoCAD Objects" (which in 1999 documented
    this stuff) complained that AutoCAD 2014 DXF contains additional command codes.
    Ha claims he found codes 33

    (no longer kAcGiOpMaxOpCodes), 38, and 51. Is thare any updated version of this
    document?

  body: 'In case anybody still reads this (google searches for acad proxy graphics
    tend to lead here), at least opcode 38 appears to be real and to be some variation
    of kAcGiOpText2 with the string in UTF16.

    I am sure an update to this document would be very welcome, but cynical me suspects
    that this glimpse of the internals could be released only because it was known
    to be outdated soon.'

  body: 'Came here looking for what opcode 51 does.

    Opcode 38 is "kAcGiOpUnicodeText2" (?) as far as I know, also opcode 36 appears
    to also be unicode text.
