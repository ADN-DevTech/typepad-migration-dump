    your praise for him to the entire ADN team :-).

  body: 'Hi Stephen,


    Thanks for consolidating this content; there''s a lot I have not yet consumed
    here personally, and look forward to doing so.


    Might I ask, if Autodesk will be making any of it''s ADN Open content available
    via iTunes as Podcasts (or perhaps iTunes U Courses)?


    You (Autodesk) are already offering iOS Apps, so this just seemed logical given
    AU Courses (previously?) being available in similar format.


    Cheers'

    content, as YouTube is blocked.

  body: 'Hi Stephen,


    with some of these downloads, especially those pertaining to the jig, everything
    seems disparately placed: the audio in one file, the video in another; - i cannot
    seem to make much sense of it.  when i clicked on the internet file which came
    with the download pack - it doesn''t seem to be working. which is a great disappointment
    given no doubt there is really cool stuff here, but can''t get access to it. I
    can''t see myself as being alone in this regard. any advice would be much appreciated.

  body: The recordings were made using Microsoft LiveMeeting. I can watchthese by
    first unzipping all the files and then opening the XXX_ReplayMeeting.htm file
    in Internet Explorer (I'm using IE11 - I didn't test using any other browser on
    Windows). HTH.
