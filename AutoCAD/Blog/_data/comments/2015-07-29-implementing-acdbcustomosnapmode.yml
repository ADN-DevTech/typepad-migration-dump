    Sorry for bad news.

  body: 'In your example code you don''t use the activateOsnapMode or deactivateOsnapMode.
    When I use these methods the Object Snap Menu from the status bar doesn''t reflect
    the actual state. When I first start my custom mode it is visible in the menu
    and has a check mark beside it. If I call a command that uses the deactivateOsnapMode
    the state of the check mark doesn''t change. If I use -OSNAP all the snaps are
    turned off, but if you look at the menu, it still has the check mark. Is this
    just a bug I should report or am I missing some other action I should be taking?
    I tried this with both 2022 and 2023.
