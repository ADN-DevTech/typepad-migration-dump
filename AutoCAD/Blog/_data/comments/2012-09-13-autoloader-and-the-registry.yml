    You specified the wrong properties. Correct properties such:

    - HostApplicationServices.Current.MachineRegistryProductRootKey

    - HostApplicationServices.Current.UserRegistryProductRootKey

  body: Hi Andrey. Thanks for pointing that out. These are properties of the HostApplicationServices
    class, but you're right that they are accessed in an AutoCAD plug-in via the HostApplicationServices.Current
    property (which returns the current HostApplicationServices instance being used).
