  body: 'Why go through all of that, when the acedSSGet() function supports the :L
    option which rejects objects on locked layers?


    Are you kidding us or what?



    Command: (ssget ":L")

    Select objects: ALL

    25012 found

    2033 were on a locked layer.'

    \nI did try the \":L\" option which is undocumented but I could only get it to\
    \ work when used along with the filter only select \"_X\" option. So decided to\
    \ include all that info into the filter resbuf instead.\n\nYes, it is indeed lenghthier,\
    \ but in my opinion it will help developers to modify that code to suit to their\
    \ specific filtering criteria."

  body: 'Hi. The :L option seems to work for me regardless of whether using "_X" all
    filter or not, but it may have something to do with the local language you''re
    using.


    While this method is undocumented,I think that is only because no one has been
    asked to document it, and it is in very extensive use out here in the real world.


    Not only that, but the managed PromptSelectionOptions class''s ExcludeObjectsOnLockedLayers
    property is the public API for the :L option in the AutoCAD .NET api, which is
    documented.
