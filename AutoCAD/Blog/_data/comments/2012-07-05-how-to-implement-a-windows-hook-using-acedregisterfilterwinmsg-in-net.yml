  body: "Augusto\n\nAs you know in Civil3d alot of the functions are not exposed in\
    \ the API. I am currently looking for a way to create a catchment object programmically\
    \ following on from my forum request here\n\n<a href=\"http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/AutoCAD-Civil-3D-Customization/Can-you-create-Catchment-Objects-from-the-API/td-p/3619810\"\

    \n\nI was thinking that I could use the sendcommand to launch the CreateCatchmentObject\
    \ which is fine and pass it an object but then the create catchment object grabs\
    \ the focus and I can not use sendkeys to tab thru the dialog  \n\nWould it be\
    \ possible to hook this window in Civil3d and return focus to my code and step\
    \ thru the dialog box with sendkey commands. or are some of the functions exposed\
    \ but not managed if so can you rap them and use them?\n\nJustin Ralston"

    Actually this can return the next hook, like suggested at <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/318804">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/318804</a>
