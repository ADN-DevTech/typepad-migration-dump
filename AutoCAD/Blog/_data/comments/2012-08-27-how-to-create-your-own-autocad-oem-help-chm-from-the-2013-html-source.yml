    Sorry, but AutoCAD Help is HTML form now. Hence why I describe how to build it
    above.'

  body: Yes, I understand that.  I thought maybe you had already created a CHM based
    on your procedure in this post.  I was asking for a copy of the CHM (if you have
    one available).

  body: 'Hi Fenton.

    I have tried to build a chm file for our OEM product.

    It works fine, but is it possible to get the search window on default topic (like
    the index.html)? I only get the right side of the "index.html" window (homepage.htm).


    Thank you,

    Stefan'

  body: "Hi Fenton,\nI was interested to try this. I think I must have missed something\
    \ because I get compilation errors i.e. \nHHC5003: Error: Compilation failed while\
    \ compiling scripts\\ACD.\nAlso with scripts\\ACG, scripts\\ACR, scripts\\AUG\
    \ and scripts\\DPG.\nI also get script errors when viewing the chm file which\
    \ may be as a result.\nAny thoughts?\nThanks.\nCraig"

    \ to share in case anyone else has the same issue.\n\nI was following the steps\
    \ from this blog post and had similar issues as you reported. You may be replacing\n\
    \"../files\" with \"./files\" in step 3. \n\nIt is important to find and replace\
    \ \".replace('../files\" with \".replace('./files\" as mentioned in the blog post.\
    \ Also, please ensure that when you first create the .hhp file, the cursor at\
    \ the end is at an empty line. When files are added in Step 6, it will append\
    \ it to the end of the .hhp file, so without the additional line, it can end up\
    \ appending incorrectly.\n\nFollowing the steps in this blog post line-by-line,\
    \ the chm built just fine.\n\nFenton's blog posts are so full of details, cant\
    \ afford to miss a step. So I followed even step 11 :)\n\nRegards,\nBalaji\n\n\
