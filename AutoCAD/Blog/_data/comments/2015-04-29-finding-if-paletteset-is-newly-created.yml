    It helps a lot, I think this is the best solution, better than the solution I
    found.


    For now, I solved it like this:

    When CAD was closed, find ''FixedProfile.aws'', and remove ''<Tool ToolName="MyPalette"
    Command="MyPalette" />'' from ''StartupInfo'' node.

    It also worked, but now, I think this is a stupid way.


    Thank you for your advice.
