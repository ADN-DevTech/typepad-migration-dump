  body: 'Hi,


    adding a Ribbon Control to a palette works fine (WPF). One question: I want to
    get the actual height of the ribbon control (changes through cycling from full
    ribbon/minimized  to panels/minimzed to tabs) to place some controls directly
    and dynamically below the ribbon control.

  body: 'Hi Wolfgang,


    Using a WPF ContentControl in the user control and settings its Content to the
    RibbonControl will automatically consider the resizing.


    Here is a sample code snippet assuming that the name of the content control is
    "MyCC" :


    System.Windows.Controls.ContentControl myCC = uc.FindName("MyCC") as System.Windows.Controls.ContentControl;

    myCC.Content = ribControl;

    developing the tool palettes in .Net? What are the points that makes us to use
    .net for developing it?

    As we can simply use Tool Palettes features in AutoCAD''s Menu, then what are
    the extra thing that can be done pragmatically for Tool Palettes.?'
