  body: I've seen late binding for the AutoCAD COM API mentioned more than once in
    some of these blogs.  Can explain more about these particular interop issues without
    late binding?  I'm curious.

  body: 'There are a number of C# to VB.NET translators available - many of them free.
    I use this one - <a href="http://www.developerfusion.com/tools/convert/csharp-to-vb/">http://www.developerfusion.com/tools/convert/csharp-to-vb/</a>
    - simply because this was one of the first ones I found and it worked well enough
    that I didn''t feel the need to look elsewhere.
