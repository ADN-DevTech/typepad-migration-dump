  body: 'It took me a while to switch over to OOP from my young days vba spaghetti,
    and wpf has definitely helped grasp the concept of MVC or MVVM by utilizing bindings.
    But i still seem to struggle where does the autocad portion of the code belong?


    For example, my app displays a list of special entities, so the view is the UI,
    and the list is the Model. The controller glues it together. But when I have methods
    that deal with autocad api, like selecting objects for example, does that belong
    in the controller? or the model?
