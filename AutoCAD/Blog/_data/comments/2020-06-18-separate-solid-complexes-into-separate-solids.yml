  body: 'Dear Madhukar Moogala

    Sorry for inconvenience. I have problem need some help from you.

    I use RealDWG lib to read .dwg file and render it on my application.

    I use some code from post <a href="https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/objectarx/triangulating-3d-solids/td-p/9618472,">https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/objectarx/triangulating-3d-solids/td-p/9618472,</a>
    and rendered it''s geometry on my application.

    But with AcDb3dsolid that contain a texture image file, i want to apply texture
    on polygon. however i don''t find solution to do it.

    I want to extract something like AcDbSubDMesh::getVertexTextureArray(AcGePoint3dArray
    &arr). With AcDbSubDMesh i can apply texture on polygon.

    Can you help me point out something to resolve this problem.

    Thanks you,


    -----'
