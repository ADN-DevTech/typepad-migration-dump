  body: Great posting... I just wish you had posted this a couple months ago. I just
    started working with ObjectARX, having done all my previous code in either Visual
    Lisp or VBA, I was faced with this decision very recently.

  body: I started years ago with VBA. When AutoCAD introduced .NET I started to learn
    C#. Now I like C# more than VB. For me it is better to read and it is not really
    a problem to learn it.

  body: 'My career in programming began with Russian analog of IBM/370 (EC-1045) -
    FORTRAN, PL / 1, Assembler.

    I''m programming with AutoCAD since 1989: AutoLisp-> ADS-> ADSRX-> ARX-> ObjectARX
    and a bit of C#. VB / VBA went past me. Perhaps that is why I do not like VB.NET

    P.S.: It is incomprehensible why the old topics in blog are closed to commenting.
    I think this is wrong - if after a certain time will be found inaccuracies or
    errors in the code or inconsistency the newest versions of AutoCAD will not report
    it to the author.'

    Oops! Looks like Typepad defaults to closing commenting on posts after one month.
    I''ve fixed that now - they should now stay open forever.


    Cheers,

    Bob Tabor: "While I began with VB, I haven''t seen a lot of docs / videos / articles
    / books using VB for Win8 or other recent technologies.  Increasingly, it feels
    to me *personally* like C# would be a good investment."


    Sounds like Bob thinks VB.NET is on the way out.'
