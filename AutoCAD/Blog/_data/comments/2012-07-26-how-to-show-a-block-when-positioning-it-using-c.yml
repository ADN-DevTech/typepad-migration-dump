  body: "Marat,\n\nThis jig works brilliantly for blocks being placed into model space.\n\
    \nHowever, the 'preview' of a block does not appear when the block is destined\
    \ for a layout.\n\nI have a requirement for some blocks to be placed in paper\
    \ space (layout specific legends, notes, 'stamps' etc).  \n\nI'm guessing that\
    \ it's something to do with block content being in model space.\n\nIs there a\
    \ trick to getting the block drag preview to show up in Layout as well?\n\nKind\
    \ regards\nBrendan Mallon"

    I searched for the world "Jig" in the .Net developers resources. Almost nothing
    came up Nada, Zero. there were three pages with the word ''jig'' in them. i surely
    cannot be alone: any ideas on where some good documentation with jigs exist?


    that would be very handy.
