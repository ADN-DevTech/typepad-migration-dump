  body: 'Hello Balaji,

    I have some query, I hope u will answer me.

    Can u list out the benefits, extra features, and reason why we are creating Tools
    Palettes using .NET API(Programming) rather than simply use AutoCAD''s Tool Palette
    from the menu item?'

  body: 'Hi,


    In this case, what can be done using the AutoCAD UI is the same as what is done
    using the API. It is a way to automate the creation of tool palette and tool palette
    groups without requiring your end-user to modify the tool palette to invoke your
    custom commands. I hope this explains.

    I also want to know the same  but could you please elaborate it a bit so that
    i can easily understand the role of using .Net for developing tool palletes.


    Thanks in advance'

    Can u elaborate what can be automate using programming? And one more thing, is
    there possibility in AutoCAD or using .NET or in both: To save and reuse the tool
    palettes on new drawing or on start-up once user log off?

    Sorry, I am not sure what you want me to elaborate.


    About saving the changes for the next session - yes, it does get saved as demonstrated
    in the sample project in the blog post.

    Can you please list out the point that can be automated using .NET since AutoCAD
    also provides TP features.

    Does AutoCAD provide Save option for saving the Tool Palettes after user has logged
    off?'

    I do not  think MFC is included in the Visual Studio Express edition. Is it possible
    for you to try it in any other version of Visual studio ?

    You should be finding that lib in \ObjectARX 2013\lib-x64 or \ObjectARX 2013\lib-win32
    folder. Do you have one of those paths added to the library directories ?


    Also, you would need platform toolset set as V100 to load it in AutoCAD 2013.
    The option to set v100 is only available in Visual Studio 2013 if you have Visual
    Studio 2010 also installed in the system.
