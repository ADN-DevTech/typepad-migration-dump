  body: 'First, anybody experimenting using this code, be careful about redefining
    the "pause" symbol. You might temporarily mess up the (command ...) statements
    in the rest of your code.


    Second, this still doesn''t work for me. It works for a while, randomly stopping
    (with a small flash of the screen) the update to the command line; one time it
    will get to 63, then another time to 57. I had been thinking that the various
    print functions were going to background processing, and that a pause to catch
    up between the code and the printing might work. But if my function is reading
    80k lines of a data file, it already takes quite a while, that''s why I need to
    show the user a status so they don''t think it''s locked up. So I don''t want
    to use a pausing mechanism that makes it take even longer. But, as I said, that
    doesn''t make it work for me, even using your sample code. And even the doslib
    (get_progress ...)progress bar stops updating after a while. So I now I''m thinking
    that all of alisp gets pushed to background processing after a certain point of
    memory use? Any more ideas?
