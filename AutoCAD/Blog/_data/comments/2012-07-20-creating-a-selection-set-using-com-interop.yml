  body: "Regards,\nMaybe someone can help me solve my problem.\nI wonder why this\
    \ code does not work when working with AutoCAD 2013:\n\nImports Autodesk.AutoCAD.Runtime\n\
    Imports Autodesk.AutoCAD.Interop\nImports Autodesk.AutoCAD.Interop.Common\n\n\
    Public Class Class1\n\n    Public ReadOnly Property ThisDrawing() As AcadDocument\n\
    \        Get\n            Return Autodesk.AutoCAD.ApplicationServices.Application.\
    \ _\n                   DocumentManager.MdiActiveDocument.acaddocument\n     \
    \   End Get\n    End Property\n\n    <CommandMethod(\"COMANDO\")> Public Sub COMANDO()\n\
    \n        Thisdrawing.Utility.Prompt(\"Hola mundo\")\n\n    End Sub\nEnd Class\n\
    \n\nI wonder if the way we work with INTEROP, and INTEROP.COMMON, has changed\
    \ in AutoCAD 2013, and if so, what would be the new way of working with these\
    \ references?.\n-----"
