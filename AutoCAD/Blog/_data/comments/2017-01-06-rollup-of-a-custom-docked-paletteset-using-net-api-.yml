  body: 'Just a note - you really should make that first param of new palletset like:

    ps = new AcWn.PaletteSet("", new Gu....

    as that string is the command to open the palette, not the name. Then you add
    the name like:

    ps.Name = "My Cool Palette";


    The trouble with not doing that is if a palette was open last session, it tries
    to open in next and the command has spaces in it. "My Palette 1" will confuse
    the heck out of acad on startup.'
