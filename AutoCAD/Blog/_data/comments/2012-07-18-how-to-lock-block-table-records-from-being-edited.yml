  body: There is a commercial solution. CADVault also requires the recipient to install
    the object enabler (aka runtime), but AutoCAD won't crash if they haven't installed

  body: So that's the same limitation than what the post is talking about in the first

    of a vault with a missing runtime, you end up with proxy graphics.
