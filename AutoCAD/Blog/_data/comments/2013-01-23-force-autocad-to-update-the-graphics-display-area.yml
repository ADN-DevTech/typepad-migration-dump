  body: 'Hi Augusto,


    I am trying to prevent AutoCAD from updating the drawing screen while a VBA app
    runs. I would like run the VBA app and update the screen when the app completes.


    Any idea how I might achieve this?

    Many thanks,

    Dan'

  body: Dan, with VBA every operation will trigger a regen, it's just how the COM
    API (ActiveX) works.

  body: Is there any way to force a regen (for example a newly copied viewport with
    layer overrides) from an active command in C# .net?  The regen only happens when
    the command ends and I want the overrides in place after the viewport is copied
    and before other tasks continue.

  body: "Can you try -<pre> vp.UpdateDisplay() </pre>\n\n<strong>Viewport.UpdateDisplay</strong>\n\
    \nThis function updates the onscreen display to reflect any changes made to the\
    \ viewport's view parameters. If no changes have been made, or the viewport is\
    \ not on, or is not onscreen, then this function does nothing. \nThis function\
    \ is automatically called when the viewport is closed, so the only time this function\
    \ should need to be explicitly called is when the viewport is in a transaction\
    \ and the onscreen graphics need to be updated before the outermost transaction\
    \ is ended.\n\n\n-----"
