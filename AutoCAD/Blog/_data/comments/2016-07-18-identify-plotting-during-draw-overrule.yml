    Please make sure you load the overrule plug-in in the back ground acad process
    also. Back ground plotting starts a background acad instance. so you need make
    sure the overrule dll is also loaded in the back ground process. Once method is
    to use autoloader mechanism (make sure the autoloader bundle) is in trusted location.


    Thanks
