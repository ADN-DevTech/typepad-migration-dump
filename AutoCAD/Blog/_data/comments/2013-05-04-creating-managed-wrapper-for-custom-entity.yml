    Your sample (and the original) are missing some very important things.


    You can read more about that in this discussion group post:

    It would be nice if the distributed sample, or any sample, showed how to support
    Data Extraction.  I''ve already come across quite a few cases where custom objects
    (including some from AutoCAD-based products) do not support Data Extraction, and
    most-definitely should.'

  body: 'Hi Larry,


    Yes, the sample project in the blog post also works with AutoCAD 2010. The .Net
    framework version will need to be changed to v3.5 by manually changing the "SimpleSquare.vcxproj"
    file as explained in this post :


    http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2921702/change-c-cli-project-to-another-framework-than-4-0-with-vs2010


    The "SimpleSquareUI" project will need to target 3.5 which can be modified using
    the project properties in Visual Studio IDE.

    Can you please refer to the <ObjectARX folder>\Samples\Entity\PolySamp example

    It uses the "StringToCIF" and "CIFToString" methods to pass strings to and forth.

    SimpleSquare uses


    property type name

    {

    get

    set

    }


    notation, while PolySamp uses

    __property void set_Center(Point2d point);


    and I originally based mine on SimpleSquare - learning from PolySamp as I go.
    anyway, my notation pulls an error on String* (no pointers in c++/cli etc) and
    the __Property notation doesn''t work either... Can I use the both property declarations
    to pass a string or am I missing something here?'
