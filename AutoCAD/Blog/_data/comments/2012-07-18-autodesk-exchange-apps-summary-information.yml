  body: "Hi, \n\nI have two basic questions regarding DWG trueview: \n- Is there a\
    \ so called “portable” version of DWG trueview for Windows XP for free downloading?\
    \ \n- Is there a version of DWG trueview for Apple MacBooks for free downloading?\
    \ \n\nSome help with the right link and any hints regarding the download are highly\
    \ appreciated. \n\nThank you in advance! \n\nStefan"

  body: 'Not sure what you mean by ''portable'', but all the information on DWG TrueView
    is posted to www.autodesk.com/trueview. If that page doesn''t mention a version
    you want, then its not available.
