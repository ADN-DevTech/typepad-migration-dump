  body: 'This is interesting I thought that handles never changed and they were "safe"
    to use when tracking objects between the file being open.


    So if you had an app tracking handles and tried to do a sync between known handles
    and what is existing in the drawing you could end up thinking that they are deleted
    when really they have just been bedit''ed?


    I am guessing I know the answer to this already but there is no mechanism in the
    API to track an object/entity definitely without condition between drawing open/close?'

  body: "Hi Dru,\n\nI am not aware of any other built-in mechanism to track it.\n\
    You can try using DBObject events, but I wanted to only track the changes during\
    \ the BEDIT operation. \nThe reason for that being, BEDIT is the only operation\
    \ that i know which changes the handle, so it may not be worth to have DBObject\
    \ events subscribed all the time.  \n\nRegards,\nBalaji"

  body: 'Hi Balaji,


    This is interesting , but in Autodesk AdvanceSteel For every command Seperate
    COM process starts and that modifies many Objects togather .So this Code hangs
    when we close those Joint Box (COM interfaces)


    What Precautions should we take

    When Model Browser is opened this mechanism hangs and Model Browser Goes to Not
    Responding State
