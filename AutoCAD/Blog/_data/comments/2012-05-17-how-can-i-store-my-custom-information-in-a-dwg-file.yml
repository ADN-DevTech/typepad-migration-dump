  body: 'Thanks for your question. I was curious to benchmark it myself and the results
    are as follows:

    I used AutoCAD 2013 on my laptop with Windows 7 32 bit.

    I found the biggest dwg file on my computer - 4771 KB.

    I simply put the code above into a cycle with 100 iterations.


    1st test: AutoCAD + Debug dll: 3 min 21 sec.

    2nd test: accoreconsole.exe + Release dll: 3 min 06 sec.

    So, approximately 2 seconds for an iteration.


    Of course, your results may differ - you may have bigger dwg files, also, the
    dwg file in my test was, obviously, completely cashed by Windows.'

  body: 'Hi, is the data stored in NOD can be read directly by navisworks?


    What if the CAD drawing convert to NWD file? is the data stored in NOD still available
    in NWD file?'

  body: I'm trying to save a large string in Xrecord date. In my case I want to save
    a json serialization. But from what I noticed Xrecord Data has a string size limitation.
    My question is is there any way to save a large string in NOD? Or a way to save
    a file.json in NOD dictionary?
