  body: "Fenton, this really doesn't work either, because if you have an application\

    Best thing is to load the RealDWG C++ sample ''DumpDWG'' and copy the Visual Studio
    projects settings from that to your own project settings.'

    \ exactly the same problem, ie my application has many libs/dlls, the removal\

    \ the solution otherwise I get the same problem with the mismatch of the _ITERATOR_DEBUG_LEVEL.\
    \  \nAny help is solving this would be greatly appreciated.\nCheers,\nDougal"

  body: 'Hey guys


    The setup issue is most likely due to the fact that the RealDWG app is not deployed
    correctly. You need to follow the Redistributable Requirements detailed in readdbx.chm.
    Failing that, the easiest way to make it work is to output your RealDWG exe to
    the RealDWG base SDK folder where all of the dependency dlls reside.'
