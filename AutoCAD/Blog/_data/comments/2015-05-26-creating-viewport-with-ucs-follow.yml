  body: 'I`ve tested this code in Autocad 2012 and 2014 - it works improperly.

    Right after command execution there is a viewport in paper space, but the view
    in it is WCS. Then I "double-click" inside the viewport and outside it - after
    this manipulation the view in the viewport became "myucs". Interesting that switching
    between model space and paper space doesn`t help in this case.


    Is it a bug in Object ARX?
