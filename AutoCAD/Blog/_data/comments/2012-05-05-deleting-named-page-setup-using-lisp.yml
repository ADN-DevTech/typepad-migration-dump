  body: 'As far as I know vlax-release-object should not be needed in this case. According
    to documentation: "When an AutoLISP routine no longer uses an object outside AutoCAD,
    such as a Microsoft Excel object, call the (vlax-release-object) function to make
    sure that the associated application closes properly."'

  body: 'Thanks Jimmy and Kerry.

    It really does no harm since it is only decrementing the reference count for the
    COM objects that we are using. Based on the reference count, the COM object should
    know how to handle it.

    Yes, As you said, in this case it might be redundant and I attribute it to my
    background with C++ COM programming :)'
