    I''ve tried to adopt this function in C#

    but with no chance

    Can you provide an appropriate code example on C#?

    Kind regards,

    Oleg'

  body: 'Hi Oleg,


    You dont really have to rely on the ARX functions I mentioned above for .NET.
    You can use the Autodesk.AutoCAD.Windows.OpenFileDialog for a file dialog and
    control how it behaves using the Autodesk.AutoCAD.Windows.OpenFileDialog.OpenFileDialogFlags
    enumeration. Please look up the AutoCAD .NET documentation for more information.


    Cheers
