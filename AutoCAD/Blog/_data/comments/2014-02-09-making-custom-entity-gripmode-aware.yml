  body: 'Hello Balaji,


    I''ve been using your simpleSquare sample and this example to update a custom
    entity I developed over ten years ago. They have been a great a help in this effort.
    I still have a few wrinkles to iron out though. I have successfully created some
    custom grips based on this example and they perform as desired. However there
    is no command line menu like you normally see (and get with the old style grips).
    So I''m guessing that must be implemented and the functions added to the grip
    data. Are you aware of any examples of this? My searching has not turned up anything.


    Thank You


    Martin Miller
