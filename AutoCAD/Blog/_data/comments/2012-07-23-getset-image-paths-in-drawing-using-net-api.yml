  body: 'Hi Irene,


    This blog post should provide the steps to follow to detach it.

    The code is in C++, but you can find equivalent API in the AutoCAD .Net API mostly
    just by dropping the "AcDb" prefix.

  body: 'Issue with a very long path (230 characters). If the image is in the same
    folder as DWG then specifying SourceFile=".\image.gif" results in eFileAccess
    error and it can''t find the file. In a shorter path this is no issue. So far
    the only solution is to supply the full long path but then the image is not xref''d
    relative. Attaching the file manually through dialog interface works no problem
    with relative path, so the problem is only via .NET. Often, but not always, when
    this occurs Directory.GetCurrentDirectory doesn''t return the proper current folder
    of the DWG so I think .NET environment is confused as to what is the current folder
    and SetCurrentDirectory doesn''t resolve the problem.
