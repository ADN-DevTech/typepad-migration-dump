  body: why has autocad not updated it's developer help files to reflect these code
    changes? It's pretty annoying to have to search through so many forums when this
    can be avoided by updating Autocad 2013 Help. I need to create a new drawing using
    a specific template and can't use the 'Add' method. Can you please give some directions

  body: 'I''ve submitted a bug report to our techpubs team about the ObjectARX Developers
    Guide section on Managed Wrappers not being updated to mention the AcCore changes
    introduced in AutoCAD 2013. (BTW You can report bugs in those docs yourself using
    the ''Comments'' link at the bottom of the page you''re reporting a bug for).


    My ultimate goal is that you should just have to search in one place for AutoCAD
    API information - you''d search on Google, Bing, or whatever your favorite search
    engine happens to be.'
