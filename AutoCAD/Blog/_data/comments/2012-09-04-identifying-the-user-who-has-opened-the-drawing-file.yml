  body: 'this is the info in the dwl file right?

    I''d prefer to have a non-adesk based routine, similar to ours that gets dwg version
    by reading first 6 chars of the dwg in ascii. still a good tip though.'

  body: 'Andrey and Owen - Yes this was spam comment. I had to delete your comments
    to remove it.


    Owen - Not sure why you say we''re ''letting'' this spammer post comments. I''m
    flagging each one as spam when it comes in, but the spammers keep creating new
    accounts. Not sure what else I can do other than flag them as spam. (Maybe its
    better to say TypePad are ''letting'' them keep posting). Maybe you know a better
    way - do tell :-)'

  body: This one is always the same name and same URL, which should be easy to block.
    I'm not familiar with the TypePad platform, but on Wordpress I can block specific
    comments or commenters by adding keywords to a comment blacklist.
