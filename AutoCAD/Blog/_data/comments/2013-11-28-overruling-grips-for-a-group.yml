    For "isApplicable" to be called, you will need to call the SetCustomFilter as
    in the sample code from this blog post.

  body: 'Hi Kelo,


    I do not think it is permitted to change the entity properties from the GetGripPoints
    which might explain the crash.


    As you see in the sample code, we only retrieve information that can help us determine
    the grip point. It does not change the entity itself.


    You may need to refactor your code to do such changes in a more appropriate callback.

    Is your code listing complete?  It seems that there is an enclosing class missing.


    Also, doesn''t your overrule''s GetGripPoints() override get called (redundantly)
    for every selected entity in a group, each time producing the same result?


    You might want to rethink your approach to solving this problem, and take into
    account (1) that the work done by your Grip overrule will be done redundantly
    for every selected entity in the same group, and (2) that entities can be members
    of more than one group, and (3) that you don''t have to open the ObjectIds returned
    by GetPersistentReactorIds() to find out if one of them is the ObjectId of a Group
    (by using the ObjectId''s ObjectClass property).'
