    More importantly, how would one clear such temporary graphics?'

  body: 'Tom,


    I dont understand what you mean by "switching from VB to C in the middle".The
    post has sample code demonstrated using ObjectARX and in C#. The choice is all
    yours.


    Regarding clearing the graphics, a regen or zoom should do - as explained in the
    post.'

  body: 'Balaji,


    It turns out I was crazy.  ;)  Sorry for the stupid questions.  I really have
    to stop trying to write code in 5 minute increments.


    Please excuse my lack of C abilities.  I''m trying to do some (very) simple temporary
    graphics, very similar to this example, in VB and I''m stuck with the RT types
    (RTSHORT, RTPOINT, etc.).


    Thank you.'

  body: 'Hi Balaji!

    I think that Tom DiVittis means that RTSHORT and RTPOINT is not defined in AutoCAD
    .NET API

    But AutoCAD .NET API has Autodesk.AutoCAD.Runtime.LispDataType type. RTSHORT is
    equivalent of (int)Autodesk.AutoCAD.Runtime.LispDataType.Int16 and RTPOINT is
    is equivalent of (int)Autodesk.AutoCAD.Runtime.LispDataType.Point2d'

    I now understand Tom''s point.

    I have updated the sample code to include the const values for RTSHORT and RTPOINT.


    Sorry for missing it out in my original post.'

  body: It is impossible to assign LineWeight to temp line drawn with acedGrDraw /
    acedGrVecs, but you can offset temp line left and right with value from 0 to Width
    with appropriate step.

  body: 'Too bad this example doesn''t show how to render the lines dynamically after
    Point 1 is placed and Point 2 still on your mouse cursor.


    I would like an interactive preview, showing the lines already before Point 2
    is placed.


    After all points (or other Editor inputs) are done, there is little reason to
    show any preview as i could then also create the final intended object anyway.'
