  body: 'Balaji thanks for this helpful article, it really gives me great help.


    While utilizing this code, i wanted to define some custom points(such as an endpoint
    of a line in a block reference)rather than MaxPoint or MinPoint in Extent of the
    block as the osnap point but failed to do it.


    Do you have any idea about how to define a normal points(such as vertexes of polyline)
    in a block reference?


    Thanks a lot.

  body: "Hi Vincent,\n\nThere should be no problem in doing that. \n\nIf you already\
    \ know that point, simply add it to the snapPoints. \n\nIf not, explode the block\
    \ reference to get a collection of entities and iterate them to identify the point.\
    \ Add the point to the snapPoints collection. The entity collection resulting\
    \ out of Explode can be discarded without adding them to the database. \n\nRegards,\n\
