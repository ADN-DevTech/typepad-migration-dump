  body: The 32-bit and 64-bit ActiveX APIs use different GUIDs. So unless you use
    late binding, you would be looking at two versions.

  body: 'Contrarily to what Stephen said, when I use AutoCAD COM interop assemblies,
    I ALWAYS make sure NOT EMBED them (i.e. always set "Embed Inperop Types" to False).  In
    fact, the error you got might just be the result of embedding.


    As for "Copy to Local" being True of False, it depends on which AutoCAD COM interop
    assemblies you are using. If you use the ones coming from ObjectARX SDK, it should
    be set to False, because AutoCAD installation has the 2 COM interop assemlies
    installed in AutoCAD folder. You can also set references to the 2 interops directly
    to the ones in AutoCAD installtion folders (thus, "Copy to Local" is false, of
    course). However, if you use Visual Studio to generate the interop for you (that
    is, in adding references dialog box''s COM tab, select AutoCAD COM libraries...),
    then the generated interops should be set "Copy to Local" as True.
