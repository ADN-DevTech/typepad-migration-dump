  body: This post single-handedly helped me figure out why I was getting exceptions
    when attempting to align my text in AutoCAD using the .NET API. It seems that
    there is a conflict when attempting to set both position and alignmentpoint properties.
    (Only alignmentpoint needs to be set, apparently.) The developer's guide doesn't
    give much detail to this tidbit!
