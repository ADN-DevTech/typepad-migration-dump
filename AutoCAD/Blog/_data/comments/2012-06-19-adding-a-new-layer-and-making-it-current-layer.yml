    When I don''t need the editor object, like in this case, I obtain the Database
    object from HostApplicationServices.WorkingDatabase because it''s thread-safe.

    Obtaining it this way is not.'

  body: 'The above written code works fine when I am creating a single layer. It fails
    when creating multiple layers.

    Here''s my code which fails at,

    LayerTable layerTable = (LayerTable)this.transaction.GetObject(this.database.LayerTableId,
    OpenMode.ForRead);


    Code:

    /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

    foreach (LayerAttributeColor item in layerColorAttributeValues)

    {

    LayerTable layerTable = (LayerTable)this.transaction.GetObject(this.database.LayerTableId,

    {

    LayerTableRecord ltr = new LayerTableRecord();


    // ... and set its properties

    ltr.Name = item.LayerName;

    ltr.Color = Autodesk.AutoCAD.Colors.Color.FromRgb(255, 0, 0);


    // Add the new layer to the layer table

  body: The best part of using CMS IntelliCAD was finding out it has all the CAD features
    I’d already worked with. I was pretty worried about finding a good fit for me,
    but CMS IntelliCAD is definitely unbeatable. Registered for free and had a free
    trial before payment, I'm glad I could test it out before any payment. CMS IntelliCAD
    is definitely worth the hype.

  body: Was a bit hesitant to try at first but CMS IntelliCAD turned out to be a good
    alternative for me. The free trial worked immediately, which was good to try it
    out before paying for it. All the features it offers are user-friendly and easy
    to work with, which was another win for me. Good job.
