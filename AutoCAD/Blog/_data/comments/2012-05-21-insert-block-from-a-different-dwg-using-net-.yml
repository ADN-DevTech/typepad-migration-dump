  body: 'Hi,

    i test WblockCloneObjects in autocad 2013, it works fine,

    but memory allocated was not disposed. If you put the code in loop autocad memory
    increase after every WblockCloneObjects and is not released (even if you close
    the document).

    Is this an autocad bug?

    Thank you'
