  body: I need to create a form to display the properties of a selected block, each
    on a combo box so the user can change these properties in this friendly interface.
    I used the login of the code of this article, but when my block properties are
    changed by this form the block is disfigured. In this case I'm changing a width
    parameter. If I change the parameter by AutoCAD palette the block is redrawn correctly.
    Does anyone have an idea what might be happening? Thanks.

  body: 'I am selecting a block and then changing the block rotation property.  I
    am having difficulty knowing which object I have selected.  the object gets highlighted
    when selected.  I get the rotation angle from the block and place the value in
    a modal dialog box.  I can then change the text value of the rotation and then
    select the insert button to do the replacement of the block.  If I select the
    wrong block I just hit a cancel button in the dialog box.


    I have several options

    (1) repaint the block in another colour

    (2) Use some form of selection that will repaint the block as dotted or highlighted

    (3) Add text or a temporary arrow pointing to the block


    What is the best appr0ach and is there some samples that show how this is done.


    Cheers
