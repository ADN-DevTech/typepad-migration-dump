  body: 'Thanks for posting this. I have a couple of questions.


    1. Where do you set the Upside down and backwords values? These are shown on the
    dialog but not in vb.net from what I can see.


    2. Using the FontDescriptor, it asks for a string, you have entered "Times New
    Roman". I have a variable dimed as a string called ''FontName'' that I want to
    place here. Each time I try, I get an error saying invalid input. But it works
    if I put it in the FileName setting. This happens even on True type fonts. And
    if I want to set a true type font and it''s styles how would I with this method?


    Thanks.'
