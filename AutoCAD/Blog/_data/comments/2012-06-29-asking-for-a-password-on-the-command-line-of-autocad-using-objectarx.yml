  body: 'Hi Fenton,

    Do you test it with AutoCAD 2013 ?

    For example with the password "aaaa" :

    1. Without dynamic input activated and if the focus is in the command line window,
    the string shown is "aaaa" and the result stored is "".

    2. Without dynamic input activated and if the focus is in the AutoCAD window,
    the string shown is "*aaa" and the result stored is "a".

    3. With dynamic input activated and if the focus is in the command line window,
    the string shown is "aaaa" and the result stored is "".

    4. With dynamic input activated and if the focus is in the AutoCAD window, the
    string shown is "****" and the result stored is "aaaa".

    The only good result is for case 4, when the input is made from the dynamic input
    tool window.

    I think the use of acedRegisterFilterWinMsg function (and also the acedRegisterWatchWinMsg)
    is incorrect when the command window get the focus (after the first character
    is typed).

    If you find an "easy" workaround, I would be happy to have it, because we use
    these functions for similary processes.

    Cheers.
