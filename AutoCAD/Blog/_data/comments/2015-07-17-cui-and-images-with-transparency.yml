  body: 'Hi Virupaksha,

    Currently we are using separate resource dlls for light and dark theme as mentioned
    in this link (Supporting AutoCAD 2015’s dark theme).

    <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2014/04/supporting-autocad-2015s-dark-theme.html">http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2014/04/supporting-autocad-2015s-dark-theme.html</a>


    For different themes, we are using different BMPs in resource dlls. As you mentioned
    in this article, we can make Transparent PNG. But, when we use PNGs in resource
    dlls, Ribbon is not able to load that image. Is there a way to load different
    PNGs for light and dark theme directly in CUIX file?'

    PNG images embedded in resource only dll are not able to load. Can you please
    send the sample of resourceonly dll that will help us using PNGs for AutoCAD menus
    and ribbons and toolbars.


    We have a resource dll in the cuix path that works perfectly with BMPs.

    I also have same problem as Suhas Hayatnagarkar has, my resource dll works fine
    with BMPs but when I try to use it with PNG files, it shows default icon(?).

    Can you please share sample code with me as well?'

    Please refer sample (contains project) <a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/autocad/2014/08/using-cuix-resource-dll-with-image-transparency.html.">http://adndevblog.typepad.com/autocad/2014/08/using-cuix-resource-dll-with-image-transparency.html.</a>
    The sample is for Ico file, but this holds good for PNG too. so please use the
    same sample and replace the ico files with PNG file. sometime next week i will
    write separate blog on this...


    thanks

    Viru'
