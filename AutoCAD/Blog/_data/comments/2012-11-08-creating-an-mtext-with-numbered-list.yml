  body: 'Hi Heinz,


    Its difficult to understand your question. What do you mean by "because the error
    message is because what I have to reload"?


    Perhaps you could tell us what error message you''re actually seeing, and we may
    be able to point you in the right direction.


    If I had to guess, it would be that you''re new to AutoCAD .NET development, and
    don''t realize that the code snippets we post on this blog generally don''t include
    the ''standard'' namespace imports needed to use the AutoCAD API. You can find
    information on that in the training material and tutorials posted to www.autodesk.com/developautocad.'

    Can you shed any light on how to apply formatting to the numbered list? Specifically
    I would like to have each numbered section maintain a hanging indent. I am using
    vb.net.


    Thank you in advance.'

    Here is a sample rtf content for creating an MText with hanging indent.

  body: "Balaji,\n\nThank you for this example code. Based on this code, the line\
    \ breaks are controlled at a specific word. What I am trying to accomplish is\
    \ an MTEXT entity that wraps based on the width I provide programatically. The\
    \ code I am attaching along with a sub routine written to create annotative mtext\
    \ produces a numbered list that allows the user to add to the entity (hitting\
    \ enter adds line with next number). The wrap is controlled by a variable passed\
    \ to the sub routine controlling the width of the MTEXT. The routine successfully\
    \ creates the numbered list, however the second, third etc. lines in each numbered\
    \ subsection do not line up with the text on the first line. Instead they fall\
    \ below the number on the first line. I hope I have explained this clearly. Thank\
    \ you again for your help.\n \n\nDim textstring2 As String = \"NOTES:\" & vbCrLf\
