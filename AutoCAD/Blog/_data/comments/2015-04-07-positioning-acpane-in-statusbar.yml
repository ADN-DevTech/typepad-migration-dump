    very nicely on 2014.


    However, we are now switching to 2016 and I wonder whether "SetStyle" with "ACSB_NORMAL"
    / "ACSB_POPOUT" still makes a difference and the user can see the state of the
    button (on or off) or whether this has to be achieved by setting two different
    icons?

  body: 'Hi!

    I have the same problem as WolframKuss.

    The calls to SetStyle(ACSB_ACTIVE); do not change anything.

    The icon stays ''inactive''.

    Changing the icon though works fine.

    I used AutoCAD 2021.
