  body: 'Hi David,

    The colon was caused by the "prompts.AcquirePoint" without text argument. I updated
    that with the string "Specify position:".

    However the code works fine on my side. I am running Win7 x64 - AutoCAD 2012.
    Do you have a different configuration?'

  body: No Philippe. Could you please tell me what should I expect to see when this
    program runs. I am really trying to understand this Imessagefilter with try and
    error. Thanks,

  body: 'You should see a moving block reference following the mouse pointer, by left-clicking
    it will place the block, right-click will print a message to the editor.


    The "System.Windows.Forms.IMessageFilter" is a .Net functionality, you should
    be able to easily find doc about it from msdn.'

  body: "Thank you for your example and the inside on jig.  I'm trying to use this\
    \ code to solve a problem of mine to no avail. \n\nSpecifically, I've created\
    \ a dynamic block by adding two Grip points.  \n\nWhen I run the insert command\
    \ I select my block and check \"Specify On-Screen\" in the Insertion point group.\
    \  The prompt on the screen is \"Specify insertion point or [Basepoint/Scale/Rotate]:\"\
    \ and at this point I can click the CTRL button and the block will cycle through\
    \ my grip points.\n\nI can use your example code to prompt the user to place the\
    \ block and can capture the CTRL button. What I'm struggling is to make AUTOCAD\
    \ redraw the block after each time I press the CTRL button at the next snapping\
    \ point (meaning the mouse cross hair becomes the next snapping point of my block).\n\
    \nAny inside on how to accomplish this?\n-----"
