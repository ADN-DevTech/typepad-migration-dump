  body: 'Hi Fenton,

    When I use the code like this where I want to invoke Open method, I usually do
    "Obsolete" attribute addidtion before of the

    CommandMethod, e.g. like this:

    [Obsolete]

    [CommandMethod("CopySpaceToExtDWG")]

    //----rest code here----//


    Is this right way?

    Thanks for your work for us

    I''ll try and get this updated so the Obsolete attribute is not longer in the
    AutoCAD API'

  body: Hi Andrey - ObjectId.GetObject makes use of the topmost open Transaction to
    open the object. Fenton's code is not using Transactions, and so using that API
    would crash in this example. You'll find posts elsewhere on this blog discussing
    Transactions, OpenCloseTransactions and Open/Close.

    Fenton/Stephen/DevTech,

    Can the Help be dated in some way or have a build number ... the downloadable
    help would be a particularly good candidate for this.


    I understood that one of the main arguments for having the help on-line was so
    that the content could be updated relatively easily .. being able to identify
    ( and possibly filter ) revised content would be a big help.


    Regards

  body: 'Hello,


    I''m just trying to transfer ent.visible to the new DB. I do "wblockcloneobjects"
    on a dynamic Blockref and wanted to use the idmapping to transfer the visible
    property of each subobject (these are nested dynamic blockreferences). Inspecting
    the idmapping, I found it contains the subblockreferences twice (different Objectids)
    as idpairs, plus the original Blockref, whose Objectid was passed to the wblockclone...
    I can''t really see the reason for the double entries, and the one "set" has everithing
    visible, the second features the correct visibility values. Checking by Quickselection
    in the Blockeditor, there are 7 Blockrefs in the Block :), the idmapping contains
    15 idpairs (7*2 + 1 for the cloned blockref).

    Any hints were appreciated!

    Thank you,

    Daniel'

  body: 'Hi there


    the title of the post says "deep cloning" but the WblockCloneObjects method is
    used.


    Just want to make sure that the aforementioned method performs a deep clone (i.e.
    if there is an extension dictionary on the source object to be cloned, will a
    copy of that extension dictionary be found in the target object?


    a pointer in the right direction would be much appreciated.
