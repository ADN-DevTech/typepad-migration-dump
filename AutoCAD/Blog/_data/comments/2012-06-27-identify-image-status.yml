    Part of my job involves electronically checking AutoCAD files designed and drafted
    by our consultants. One of my checking activities is checking xrefs. Somewhere
    in your toolbox of goodies, do you have a similar program in lisp or .net that
    reports on the status of an xref, i.e., attached, overlay, not found, unresolved,
    orphaned, unloaded, etc.?


    Thank You!'

    For starters, look up the methods/properties of the BlockTableRecord class in
    the ObjectARX Managed Reference Guide (part of the ObjectARX SDK - www.objectarx.com).


    Cheers,
