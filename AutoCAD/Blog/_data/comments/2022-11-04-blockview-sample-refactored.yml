  body: Writing in college as a foreign student can be a daunting task. However, by
    taking the time to learn about the resources available to you, you can gain the
    skills and confidence necessary to succeed. First and foremost, it is important
    to familiarize yourself with the expectations of your professors. Different cultures
    and countries can have different expectations when it comes to writing. For example,
    some professors may prefer essays that are more analytical and argumentative,
    while others may prefer more descriptive writing. By understanding the expectations
    of your professor, you can adjust your writing accordingly.

  body: Nice to see this BlockView evolving, however there is still an issue with
    the OrbitGadget and the ZoomWindowGadget defined in the GsPreviewCtrl.h header
    file. They are simply not working/showing. No matter wether hw-acceleration is
    enabled or not, they will never show up in the preview. I had it working in the
    old days of Acad2009, but with newer versions no luck. Anyone knows how to fix
    it?
