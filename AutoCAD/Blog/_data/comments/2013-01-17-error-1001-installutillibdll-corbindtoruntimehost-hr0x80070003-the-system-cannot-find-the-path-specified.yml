  body: "Hey Jack\n\nprobably, you will have to change your MSI (the one that has\
    \ been fully merged with my solution above) so that the InstallExecuteSequence\
    \ table contains \"Not Installed\" for the sequence items that cause the issue.\
    \ \n\nOr, you can solve the issue where the InstallUtil components are not found\
    \ on uninstall and put us all out of our misery!!!"
