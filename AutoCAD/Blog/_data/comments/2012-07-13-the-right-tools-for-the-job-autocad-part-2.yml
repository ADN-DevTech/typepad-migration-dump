    I have difficulty reconsiling your recommendation for beginners to learn VBA with
    your companys dropping support of the product.


    Are AutoDesk going to bring back VBA support ??

  body: "Hi Fenton,\n\nIn my mind, cpp should be considered more often than you suggest\
    \ (vs .net):\n - You cannot target mac os using .net\n - Building a simple application\
    \ (beginner) using ObjectArx is not such a big deal\n - Managing objects states\
    \ is in my mind safer using oarx than using .net. for instance, disposing a transaction\
    \ (C#) is quite easy to forget, it's easy for a beginner to get messed up with\
    \ exception handling when code became more complex. On the other hand, cpp code\
    \ now has clear-and-efficient classes such as AcDbSmartObjectPointer.\n - Calling\
    \ unexposed methods using P-Invoke is quite difficult for beginners\n\nto summarize,\
    \ I more or less agree with you but I would be much more moderate, especially\
    \ as c++ become easier (c++11) and still as fast. I would say that people may\
    \ not fear c++!\n\nAnyway, thank you for these posts, they are very helpful for\
    \ all who want to join us coding with acad.\n\nLoic\n\n(please excuse my english,\
    \ it is often quite bad)"

  body: "The C++ comment is very valid, thanks Loic. If you do go for C++ then really,\
    \ the world is in your hands because you can do pretty much anything with AutoCAD.\n\
    \nI totally understand all of your points on VBA. \n\nThe bottom line is though\
    \ - VBA is still available for AutoCAD and in my opinion the cheapest and easiest\
    \ (for a complete beginner) to start programming AutoCAD with. \n\nAlso in my\
    \ opinion, as a complete beginner, starting with VBA is the easiest way to get\
    \ into AutoCAD VB.NET, which should be your ultimate goal. \n\nPlease keep your\
    \ comments coming!\n\nNext post is all about Performance, and I think are you\
    \ going to be surprised at some of the results!"

  body: "I do not agree about VBA. \nIMO, AutoLISP is the best way for beginers, it's\
    \ the natural continuation of autoCAD customization after scripts and command\
    \ macros and the learning curve may be very fast with the help of a very large\
    \ community.\n\nIf the goal is .NET, I'd say start with C# which encourage better\
    \ programming practices and the strictness required with bigger applications.\n\
    I don't think VB is more easy then C#, I just would say it's more laxist...\n\n\
    I know there're very good codes written in VB(A), but I also know VBA allows (encourage)\
    \ some 'not so good' programming practices (using of global (module) variables,\
    \ hiding exceptions with On Error Resume Next, mixing static typing, implicit\
    \ casts and late binding, ...). And VB.NET keeps many of these behaviors available\
    \ so that the worst VBA codes can be migrated to VB.NET as they are.\n\nSo, let\
    \ die VBA, start playing with LISP, and if you really enjoyed it, then, have fun\
    \ with F# !\n\nJust my 2 cents..."

  body: 'Hi Fenton and readers


    Times have changed. now you can get excellent functionality through Visual Studio
    community edition for free - which is better than the express edition of old.
    The community edition provides a very high level of functionality to do code almost
    anything. and if you want to full suite of tools you can go for the pro version
    too.'

    I learned Acad programming in c# and i am still consider myself as beginner. You
    can''t imagine how much time i lost every time i wanted to debug! For a beginner
    i think its really important to start with something IDE like VBA
