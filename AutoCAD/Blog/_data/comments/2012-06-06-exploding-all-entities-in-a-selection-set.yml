  body: "Hi petcon,\n\nThere is nothing wrong with using 'L' in the above code.\n\n\
    We migrated AutoCAD to Unicode in the 2007 release. At that time, _T (or similar)\
    \ was recommended to allow developers to support MBCS and Unicode from the same\
    \ codebase. But the last MBCS version of AutoCAD (AutoCAD 2006) has long since\
    \ retired (and is now sitting on a beach sipping pina coladas :-). \n\nIf you\
    \ really want to support very old AutoCAD versions, then by all means continue\
    \ using _T. That is a decision based on the needs of your customers and the effort\
    \ it takes you to maintain that support. But if you don't want to support those\
    \ old MBCS versions then using L is fine.\n\nThe ADN DevTech team support the\
    \ previous three product releases - and focus the majority of our effort on the\
    \ latest release - so we're not going to be generally considering backward support\
    \ beyond that in code we post here.\n\nYou are, of course, very welcome to comment\
    \ on legacy support issues for the benefit of other readers. But we won't be updating\
    \ code in our blogs posts as a result of such comments.\n\nAnd thank you for contributing\
    \ your comments to this blog.\n\nCheers,\n\nStephen"

  body: There's also an argument for using _T to make code easier to migrate forward
    to future versions of AutoCAD that use UTF-32 or some such future string format.
