  body: Hi, I have some problems when using Dimension.GeometricExtents on autocad
    2012. It is fine on autocad 2009. After debuging the program I found that the
    DimBlockId property of Dimension object was set to null. I have read the document
    of autodesk :<a href="http://docs.autodesk.com/ACDMAC/2011/ENU/ObjectARX%20Reference/index.html?frmname=topic&frmfile=AcDbDimension.html,">http://docs.autodesk.com/ACDMAC/2011/ENU/ObjectARX%20Reference/index.html?frmname=topic&frmfile=AcDbDimension.html,</a>
    but it is not just like that Modifying a dimension in a noncurrent database. It's
    just modifying the dimension in the current database. Because the DimBlockId is
    set to null(I don't know why), the GeometricExtents property will throw an exception.
    Do you have any idea about this?
