  body: This is a nice suggestion.  Could you increase the number of steps and decrease
    the sleep time in order to get a smoother animation?

    Thanks for your comment. I have updated the sample code and the recording. The
    animation is much smoother than what it was earlier.

    \ But for the drawing that is attached to this post,\nsimply commenting out the\
    \ vtr.RenderMode should also work ok. \n\nRegards,\nBalaji\n\n-----"
