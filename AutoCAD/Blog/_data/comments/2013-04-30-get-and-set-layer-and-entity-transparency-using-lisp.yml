  body: "Adam, \n\nI think you're making this far more complicated than it needs to\
    \ be.\n\nWhy are you twice (once in your test command, and another in your sub-function),\
    \ converting to/from respectively vla-Object, to eName, when you can instead work\
    \ with eName alone?\n\nAs I'm sure you're already aware.... \n\nIn the case of\
    \ the test function, instead of converting the eName to vla-Object, extracting\
    \ the Layer Property string, you could instead simply extract (cdr (assoc 8 (entget\
    \ eName))).\n\nAs for the sub-function, instead of getting the Layer Object from\
    \ the Layers Collection via layerName string parameter, then converting that with\
    \ vlax-Vla-Object->Ename, one can instead simply use TblObjName function on the\
    \ Layers table directly.\n\nCheers"

  body: "Hi BlackBox,\nThank you for the comments. Yes, it seems I'm a bit prone to\
    \ use ActiveX in LISP :) - especially when the code in the question is using it\
    \ already.\nI updated the code accordingly. \nThanks again,\nAdam\nPS: What's\
    \ even more important of course is that now I added colours to the code :-D"
