  body: 'Hi there,


    One thing you could check is if the history recording is switched on for the solids
    that you are trying to perform boolean operations on. Maybe switching that off
    would help.


    Apart from that I''m not sure what you could try. Boolean operations are computation
    intensive and because of that I''m not really surprised that your program spends
    the majority of its time there - depends on the complexity of the solids you are
    working with.


    Sorry that I cannot help more.


    Cheers,

    Adam
