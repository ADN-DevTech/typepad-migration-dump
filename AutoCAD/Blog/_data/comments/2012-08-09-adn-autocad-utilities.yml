  body: Thanks for posting but it would be better I think to just have the files zipped
    because now I need to install them on two separate machines to get the files for
    both 32-bit and 64-bit.

  body: "Hi Jimmy,\n\nThanks for pointing it out.\n\nIf you are trying to install\
    \ it on a 32 bit system, the 64 bit installer wouldnt work. But, on a 64 bit system,\
    \ you can run the 32/64 bit installers to get the contents. \n\nYou are right,\
    \ It would be much easier if we packaged it as a zip, but it is easier to include\
    \ the EULA in an installer. I am discussing this with my colleagues, to see if\
    \ it can be provided as a zip.\n\nThank you."

  body: "Hello,\n\nThanks for your comments.\n\nI agree that the use of OCX is outdated.\
    \ But there are many developers who have applications built using it and we need\
    \ to support them.\n\nUsing WPF, it is now much easier to create controls such\
    \ as the AcadColor or AcadLineType etc.\n\nSo in my opinion, applications being\
    \ written ground-up might use the OCX controls to quickly get the functionality\
    \ and then move to a custom control implemented using WPF if they prefer to avoid\
    \ the hassles with ActiveX controls. \n\nRegarding having such controls built\
    \ into AutoCAD, I am not sure if that can happen anytime soon because they will\
    \ need to be prioritized against other tasks by the engineering team."

  body: 'Hi Jimmy,


    Can you clarify a little? Do you need the 64 bit controls on a 32 bit machine?
    If so, can you explain why? If you need to install the 64 bit controls on a 32
    bit machine I suspect it is only because you want to access the 64 bit merge modules.
    In that case, it would just be easier for us to package the merge modules separately
    and distribute them. Having the actual 32 and 64 bit controls on the same machine
    could lead to unnecessary headaches.'

  body: My build machine is 32-bit where I build for both 32-bit and 64-bit. But it
    is not a big deal, I just installed on the 64-bit machine and copied the 64-bit
    files I needed. I don't use the merge modules though.

  body: 'Hallo Balaji,

    Thanks for you answer,

    I have tested DwgThumbnail.ocx on a VBA form (DwgThumbnail1.DwgFileName = Testfilename)
    with AutoCad Electrical 2013. (where Testfilename is a path to a valid dwg file)
    With Testfilename saved as 2013 there comes an error msg: Invalid file format!
    When saving Testfilename back to version 2010 or 2007 all works fine. When saving
    again the same Testfilename to version 2013 the error comes back.

    Therefore i think the problem is not in the vba programcode. Probably there is
    an other problem, the preview in the project explorer from Electrical also does
    not work with 2013 drawings. (windows register to an older version ??) In the
    windows explorer preview pane all versions works normal up to 2013.

    Thanks

    Rene
