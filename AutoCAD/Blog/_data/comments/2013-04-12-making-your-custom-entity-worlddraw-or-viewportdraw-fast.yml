  body: 'hi,

    Is this even true for AcGiGeometry::draw calls?


    Thank you'

    yes, it''s true!!


    You can also check inputPending() for AutoCAD side user interaction checking.'

  body: god, I've never noticed that before, I've yet developed many (sometimes complex)
    subWorldDraw overrides, shame on me, thanks to you!

    no problem. One last thing, if you use DrawJigs, then the same rule applies. If
    you use AcEdJig, then you should check inputPending() for long iterations in your
    code - otherwise it''s handled by AutoCAD automatically.'

    in my code


    thanks'

  body: "Hi Fenton,\nOne last question, can we test AcGiCommonDraw::regenAbort return\
    \ as well?\n\ni.e. would these pseudo-code equivalent? (sorry for indent)\n\n\
    ----\nfor each (ent in ents){\n  if (mode->geometry().draw(ent)) //your tip\n\
    \    break;\n}\n----\nfor each (ent in ents){\n  mode->geometry().draw(ent);\n\
    \  if (mode->regenAbort())\n    break;\n}\n----\n\nthis question because, somewhere\
    \ in my code, I have a custom acgiworlddraw/acgigeometry with draw(AcGiDrawable*)\
    \ overrided and I wonder if this method has to return the result of AcGiCommonDraw::regenAbort\
    \ in order to behave correctly.\n\nThank you"

  body: "Hey Loic!\n\nyou are absolutely right, regenAbort() informs you when you\
    \ should not waste anymore time creating your geometry. \n\nThanks for the reminder,\
    \ it seems you got a lot out of this one which is nice to hear\n-----"
