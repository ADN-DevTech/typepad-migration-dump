  body: 'Hi Balaji,

    What about the new assoc dimensions based on AcDbAssocPersSubentId (<a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/autocad/2015/02/making-a-custom-entity-associative-dimension-enabled.html)">http://adndevblog.typepad.com/autocad/2015/02/making-a-custom-entity-associative-dimension-enabled.html)</a>
    ?

    I have some issues to make my custom compound entities compatible with this new
    behavior and I think having a sample similar to yours but using the new behaviour
    would help me to understand how it works.


    Thanks!

  body: 'Hi Loic,


    Sorry for the delay in replying to you. I had taken a day off last Friday.


    I will look into the sample that you shared and see how we can get it to work
    with the AcdbAssocPersSubentId.


    I will get back to you on this.


    Regards,

    Balaji'

  body: "Hello Balaji,\n\nI am trying to create the associative dimension in paper\
    \ space same as example. As per your sample code, it works well for top viewport\
    \ with scale 1:1. But creates issues for dimensions in isometric views with scale\
    \ other than 1:1. Before creating AcDbDimAssoc object. I override DIMLFAC for\
    \ dimension by using setDimlfac(). Which include scale (1.22 * 10). It dimension\
    \ showed correct value after creating it. But after I changed view scale manually,\
    \ the value is no longer correct. \nAfter checking difference between manual and\
    \ programmatic dimension in ArxDbg, I found XDATA for ACAD_DIMASSOC_CALC_DIMLFAC,\
    \ ACAD_DIMASSOC_DIMLFAC and ACAD_DIMASSOC_OVERRIDDEN_DIMLFAC in manual dimensions.\
    \ \nAfter googling I found link <a href=\"https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/autocad-2000-2000i-2002-archive/paperspace-dimensions-giving-incorrect-values/m-p/141420\"\

    \ for DIMLFAC XDATA. I mentioned to set XDATA for these applications.\nIn code\
    \ after creating AcDbDimAssoc I set XDATA to dimension for ACAD_DIMASSOC_OVERRIDDEN_DIMLFAC\
    \ with lfac*viewscale and ACAD_DIMASSOC_CALC_DIMLFAC with viewscale.\nThen dimension\
    \ worked fine for all manual operations (changing viewscale, modification in line).\n\
    \nIs it safe to set XDATA for DIMLFAC?"
