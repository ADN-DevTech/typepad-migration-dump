  body: Hi Augusto. I'm trying to open files to change some XREFs inside and save
    it with the same name. My problem is that sometimes a file is open and my program
    crash. How can ask if the file is open by someone to leave it without crash?

    Is a file is already opened, then it should be a .dwl/.dwl2 file with same name
    at the same folder. One way can be check is the file exists.

  body: 'Hello,


    I think, the right solution in this case like below:

    We should check whether these file is open or not, if it was opened, then we should
    use document iterator from Arx sdk, then get database from AcApDocument, once
    we have database , the job is done.


    Best regards.'
