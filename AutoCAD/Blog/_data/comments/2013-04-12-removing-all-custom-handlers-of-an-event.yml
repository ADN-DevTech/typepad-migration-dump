  body: "Hello Augusto, this is Fernando from Mexico greeting you.\nI have tried your\
    \ interesting code in a home project where I would like\n to cancel the events\
    \ of another command that my drawing entities can read\n (through lisp for example),\
    \ I have loaded your code after another container \nof events, I have ordered\
    \ Remover and it is then when this fatal error arises:\nUnhandled Access Violation.\
    \ Reading 0x0000 Exception at a292c02h.\n  What am I doing wrong?\n  Any solution\

  body: "Thanks Augusto for yur answer but, I tried with RemoveHandlers(doc, \"CommandEnded\"\
    ) and I have failed. I notice that the events handlers coming from command methods\
    \ are persistent regardless of whether they were loaded before or after your assembly.\n\
    \ I wish i had could make a list of RemoveHandlers(doc, \"EventName1\")\n RemoveHandlers(doc,\
    \ \"EventName2\"), etc\n  Thanks in advance.\n-----"
