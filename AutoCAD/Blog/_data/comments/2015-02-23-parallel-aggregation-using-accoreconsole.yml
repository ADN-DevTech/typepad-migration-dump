    That script would netload the custom .net plugin and invoke the custom command.


    ;Load the .Net module

    (command "_.Netload" "C:\\Temp\\EntityBreakup.dll")

    ; Run the command

    EntBreakup

    Thanks for pointing that out. It seems the tool that converts the code to html
    format for posting it in typepad has messed it up.


    It should be :

    coreprocess.StartInfo.Arguments = string .Format("/i \"{0}\" /s \"{1}\" /l en-US"
    ,fi.FullName, @"C:\Temp\RunCustomNETCmd.scr" );


    I will fix the post


    Thanks

    Works like a charm. But could it be, if I use the parallel code to run the publish
    command, that sometimes the pdf files are corrupt or the content of one PDF file
    is from the wrong drawing?

    Does AutoCAD use the same temporary files for the different processes while publishing?'

    The problem doesn''t occur all the time. Sometimes the documents are ok, but sometimes
    some of them are corrupt.

    I''ve used the Subscription Center to offer you some sample files and a sample
    project (#10499576).

    if one uses ScriptPro 2.0 - does this not employ parallel processing of drawings?
    I mean this post and ScriptPro do virtually the same things in terms of parallel
    processing correct?

  body: "Hey everyone, \nI recently discovered a VERY fast method of processing dwg\
    \ files using accorconsole (or AutoCAD if that is what you prefer). For example,\
    \ running a search and replace operation of dbtext and mtext on a batch of dwg\
    \ files runs at around 15 drawings/second on a single process. Setting up 5 or\
    \ 6 in parallel will process close to 5000 drawings/minute! I thought I would\
    \ share this with the community as this discovery has been a game-changer for\
    \ my company when it comes to processing large batches of dwg files.\n\nFor this\
    \ you have to use the .NET API. I did all the code for processing in C#, and the\
    \ only 2 lines in the lisp script file is to NETLOAD my dll and call the command\
    \ that does the processing.\n\nTurns out, you can work on multiple dwg files in\
    \ the same instance of accoreconsole. The idea here is to just load the dwg database\
    \ without actually opening the drawing (takes ~70ms), manipulate the database,\
    \ then save it. For the i/ switch, you can use any dummy drawing file as it will\
    \ have no effect on your batch. Then in C# in your command method, you would do\
    \ something like this:\n\nforeach(string drawingFilePath in dwgFiles)\n{\n   \
    \ database = new Database(false, true);\n    database.ReadDwgFile(drawingFilePath,\
    \ FileShare.ReadWrite, true, String.Empty);\n    using(Transaction transaction\
    \ = database.TransactionManager.StartTransaction())\n    {\n        //DO STUFF\
    \ HERE\n        transaction.Commit();\n        database.SaveAs(drawingFilePath,\
    \ DwgVersion.Current);\n    }\n    database.Dispose();\n}\n\nLet me know if you\
    \ have any questions or need more detail,"

  body: '@Nik,


    I''m doing something very similar where my .net code prompts for a filename and
    the .script file calls the command and supplies the filenames.  I know the original
    post is 8 years old, but I''m also not supplying an initial drawing to open using
    the /i switch.  The issue I''m running into is the profile.  Once the profile
    is set in the .bat, it remains the next time I open AutoCAD.  Would you happen
    to know a way of stopping this?  Or to get the profile set back to none?  The
    CProfile variable is read-only, so....
