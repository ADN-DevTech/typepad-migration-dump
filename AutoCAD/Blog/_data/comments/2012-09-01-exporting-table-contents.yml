    Lacks of CSV is the loss of cells formating (merge, cell/row/column styles, border
    settings). For the solving this problem, better to create XML + XSL. Such result
    can be looked in the browser like the formatted table, or can be parsed in any
    programm.

    You are right, CSV has those limitations.


    Thanks for suggesting the XML alternative that can retain the formatting.
