  body: Code that uses SymbolTable's Has() or this[] indexer needs to avoid failing
    when either of those methods indicates an entry exists, because they both recognize
    erased entries.

  body: 'Hi

    Can you please check again? I feel “has” and “this[]” should work fine. Means
    should not recognize the erased items. (AutoCAD 2010 & above)


    Thanks
