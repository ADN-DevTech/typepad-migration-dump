  body: "Hi Preston,\nThis post is pretty old, so, sorry for the delay!\nMy application\
    \ is made of about 40 arx (20 dbx) and I've just begin my \"application-split\"\
    \ (on acad 2015).\nI'd like to share a few stuff I've experienced to (I hope)\
    \ complete this post (random remarks):\n - crx applications are compatible with\
    \ OEM - tested on OEM 2015 (BindArx option has to be checked in oemmakewizard)\n\
    \ - I've hugely used dependency walker to identify actual __direct__ function\
    \ calls from my modules to any of modules you've listed in this post (I actually\
    \ only had dependencies to acad, acui20 and adui20). This helped me to identify\
    \ code sections that were purely arx (vs crx)\n - Having my own arx modules dependency\
    \ graph essential to define the best order of \"migration\"\n - Some arx I had\
    \ were eligible to be moved to crx without any code modification (no dependencies\
    \ found)\n\nI haven't finished the split yet but for now I found it quite straightforward\
    \ despite there is a real lack of documentation.\n\nIt's probably too late to\
    \ post these comments since I guess all who would have been interested in accore\
    \ features (batch) have probably migrated already...\n\nmy two cents.\n\n\n-----"
