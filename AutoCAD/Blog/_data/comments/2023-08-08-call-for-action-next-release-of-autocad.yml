  body: "Thanks Vic, \n\nThe AutoCAD.NET API is a thin wrapper over our native C++\
    \ code, the actual grunt work happens on C++, there is no change in the way API\
    \ used, or in the performance improvement due to change in NET 4.x to NET 8.0,\
    \ only the underlying tech is changing.\n\nCheers,\nMadhu."

  body: Will there be prereleases of RealDWG with .NET 6/8 support as well? It would
    really help the transition effort on the receiving end if we could get a head
    start.

    AutoCAD and ObjectARX for next release are already available in betas, you can
    test your RealDWG applications against the ObjectARX SDK available in our beta,
    let us know how it would help you releasing beta for RealDWG beyond what is available
    with ObjectARX SDK and AutoCAD, as of now no plans, but I would like to know.

  body: Exciting news for AutoCAD developers! The plan to support .NET Core technology
    in the next release, AutoCAD 2024 + 1, is a welcome step forward. The transition
    from .NET 6.0 in alphas to .NET 8.0 in betas and the final release is promising.
    Looking forward to the advancements in the AutoCAD API.
