  body: 'Hi,


    is it possible to control the draw order of a non-persistent transient drawable,
    relative to database-resident entities in the drawing through .NET or P/Invoking
    the Object-ARX-API? I know about TransientDrawMode / subDrawMode parameters of
    the TransientManager.AddTransient method, but it seems this is not enough.


    Background is, we''re trying to draw a transient image with worldDraw.Geometry.Image(...)
    which works, but sometimes the image is drawn above and sometimes below database-resident
    entities. Our goal is to keep it always in the background.
