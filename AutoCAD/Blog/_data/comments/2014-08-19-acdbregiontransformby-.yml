    I wonder if this mean that the .NET API has been affected too (the Tolerance class).
    If so it''s not documented.'

    This blog post is to indicate a workaround and test check if your old algorithms
    are not working on 2015, how ever this is only a temporary solution.

    If there is a change in Tolerance class we would know and let you know.'
