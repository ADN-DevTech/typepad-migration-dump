  body: "I think we can do a little better than this. \n\nFirst open every layer in\
    \ the database, and if the layer is frozen, add its ObjectId to a HashSet<ObjectId>.\
    \ Then, while visiting entities, one only needs to check to see if the entity's\
    \ LayerId property is in the HashSet, and if it is, the entity is on a frozen\
    \ layer. Doing that way requires that each layer only be opened once, rather numerous\
    \ times."
