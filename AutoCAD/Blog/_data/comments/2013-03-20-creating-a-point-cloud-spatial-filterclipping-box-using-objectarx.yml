  body: 'Pretty useful thing,

    Maybe a really simple question but typically users would want to snap to some
    points of the point cloud, however, the call to

    AcDbEntityPointer ent(id, AcDb::kForWrite);

    or more specifically the AcDb::kForWrite seems to kill the snapping on to the
    point cloud points.


    Is it possible to have a workaround on that ?'

  body: 'By the way should there be a call to acdbModifyPointCloudDataView

    in the modified() function of the myBoxReactor ?

    The extents are updated then the point cloud points should be updated as well
    since just notifying the graphic system is not enough to change the point cloud
    view and thus the acdbModifyPointCloudDataView is required.'

  body: "Hey Xerion\n\nyes, you are right, the snapping will be disabled. \n\nTo get\
    \ round the problem, simply close the point cloud after the acdbResetPointCloudDataView()\
    \ then reopen before acdbModifyPointCloudDataView()"

  body: for your second comment, you don't need to call acdbModifyPointCloudDataView()
    as the filter is already applied. My call to onModified will queue the graphics
    refresh at the next asynchronous graphics update.
