  body: "Hi Balaji!\nIt specifically did you write such a complex code to ObjectARX,\
    \ and so simple in C#?\nWith the help of ObjectARX code can be as laconic as using\
    \ C#. For example:\nstatic void MoveBelow(AcDbObjectId &idDown, AcDbObjectId &idUp)\n\
    {\n  AcDbSortentsTable *pSortTab = NULL;\n  AcDbObjectId spaceId = AcDbObjectId::kNull;\n\
    \  AcDbEntityPointer pEnt(idDown,AcDb::kForRead);\n  if (pEnt.openStatus() ==\
    \ Acad::eOk) {\n    spaceId = pEnt->ownerId();\n    pEnt->close();\n  }\n  if\
    \ (!spaceId.isNull()) {\n    AcDbObjectPointer pBTR(spaceId,AcDb::kForRead);\n\
    \    if (pBTR.openStatus() == Acad::eOk) {\n      if (pBTR->getSortentsTable(pSortTab,\
    \ AcDb::kForWrite, true) == Acad::eOk) {\n        AcDbObjectIdArray ar; ar.append(idDown);\n\

  body: 'Hi Alexander,


    The C# sample is from my recent reply to a developer while the ObjectARX one is
    a bit old. I did not attempt to make them look similar. Thanks for your sample
    code. I will update the post.'

  body: "Well, you cannot trust Google translator (or any electronic/onlne translator,\
    \ for that matter) in this case.\n\nthe cobination of the 3 Chinese characters\
    \ can have different meanings, depending on the context when it is used. \n\n\
    In this particular case, petcon' really meant to ask to be more CAREFUL, or have\
    \ more thought on what you were posting. \n\nIt only means to have some snack\
    \ when someone points at some snack to you."

    I get it now, and will be careful in future.


    BTW the ObjectARX code that I posted does work. Anyway, I will be reposting the
    ObjectARX code to make it simpler.


    Thanks again for explaining what those 3 chinese letters meant :)'

    Another idea. What about not using asynchronous  sendStringToExecute method but
    using ads_regen function: <a href="http://adn.autodesk.com/adn/servlet/devnote?siteID=4814862&id=11845587&linkID=4900509">http://adn.autodesk.com/adn/servlet/devnote?siteID=4814862&id=11845587&linkID=4900509</a>

    I don''t see the SortedList used anywhere. Is there some other code missing?'
