  body: How are you then dealing with needing to make code changes that effect both
    the "main" and the "release2024" branch? - For example, ongoing improvements where
    you want to support both Autocad 2024 and 2025 (and 2026)?

  body: 'To support both AutoCAD 2024 (.NET Framework 4.8) and newer versions like
    2025+ (.NET 8), we use a Git branching strategy where main targets the latest
    development for AutoCAD 2025+ and modern .NET, while release2024 maintains compatibility
    with older versions. Shared improvements or bug fixes are developed in main and
    cherry-picked into release2024 as needed. Features using 2025+ APIs stay in main,
    keeping the codebase clean and forward-compatible while supporting legacy users.
    You can bundle the respective DLLs in version-specific folders under Contents
    and configure them using RuntimeRequirements in PackageContents.xml.
