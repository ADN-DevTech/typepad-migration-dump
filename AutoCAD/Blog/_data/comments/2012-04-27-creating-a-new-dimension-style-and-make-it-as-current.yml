  body: 'When I create a new dimension style, it looks like override of the previously
    current one. In the description, it says ISO-25 + ''all the overriden properties''

    It then causes problem when changing arrow type. Is there a way to create new
    dimension style without any relation to an existing one?'

    above code should create a new dimension style without any relation to exiting
    one. So, not sure about steps you are following to create the new dim style

    same issue (existing drawing, adding a new style and changing some of the dims
    to use the new style).


    I commented out the db.SetDimstyleData line and it stopped overriding the existing
    style.'

    It wont make the style current when drawing the command. Its creates the dimension,
    says its on the right style, but doesnt display the style correctly..'
