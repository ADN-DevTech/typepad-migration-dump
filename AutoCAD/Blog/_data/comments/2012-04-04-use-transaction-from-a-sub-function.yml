    I hope this message finds you well (long time since your post).


    Following your insight

    (i.e. no necessity of both outer+inner trans objects):


    Suppose we have "outer" main procedures (e.g. commands subs),

    which call a variety of "inner" helper methods.


    Do you think there is a preferred practice:

    a. Start an "outer" transaction inside the main procedure? or

    b. create "inner" transactions inside each of the helper methods?


    Thanks in advance, Eyal.
