  body: 'Augusto, thank you very much for the article!

    Please, anybody help me! Is there any programmatic way to validate PnID Pipe Line
    Segments and P3D Pipe Run Elements (pipe, elbows, tees, reducers, ect.). There
    is no "Validate" column for PnID Pipe Line Segments in Project Setup.

    I''ve written about it here
