    is there any way to do that in C#?

    I just want to get the start and endpoint of hatchlines without using ARX.

  body: 'Hi Juergen,


    I see a method called "GetHatchLinesData" in the Hatch class that returns a "Line2dCollection"
    in the managed API documentation. So I think it is possible to get that info without
    using ObjectARX.


    I havent used it but please do let me know if you have any issues in getting that
    method to work.'

  body: "Hi , During converting some old Lisp code to .Net , I faced a situation.\
    \ After analysing the Lisp code we understand its calling some ARX functions (not\
    \ commands , originally ads function - the whole ObjectARX project does not have\
    \ a single executable commands but all are functions called by AutoLisp ).\nFor\
    \ example as below,\n\nint ReturnListToAutoLisp(void)\n{  \n   struct resbuf *LIST;\
    \ \n\n   //...\n   //...  = acedGetArgs\n   //...\n      \n   acedRetList(LIST);\n\
    \   return RTNORM;\n}\n\nThe function itself does not return the list but the\
    \ list is returned by the acedRetList.\nNow the below AutoLisp code that calls\
    \ this functions and store the return value in a list.\n(setq returnedList (ReturnListToAutoLisp\
    \  5))\nThrough it looks that the ReturnListToAutoLisp  takes an integer ( like\
    \ 5 here ) but actually in the ObjectARX code its parameter list is void ) . However\
    \ the parameter value passed are collected by calling acedGetArgs.\nAlso the return\
    \ value is not a single integer but a list of strings which are collected in the\
    \ AutoLisp variable named ‘returnedList’ and which is used to populated DropDown\
    \ list in DCL UI.\nSo far its okey.\nI have ported the old ObjectARX 2005 code\
    \ to ObjectARX 2014 version and its working fine when called from AutoLisp.\n\
    But while converting the Lisp code to VB.Net , I can’t find a way to collect the\
    \ return value in a .Net variable of type string List (List(Of String)).\n\nI\
    \ found samples to call ObjectARX functions from .Net using P/Invoke which focus\
    \ on passing arguments by creating a ResultBuffer. But I did not find a single\
    \ sample that demonstrate how to collect the list of values retuned from ObjectARX\
    \ functions through acedRetList.\n\nI am counting that there must be a way but\
    \ can’t figure it out. \n\nPlease help."

  body: 'Hi Subir,


    From what I understand, your ObjectARX function is implemented to provide its
    output to Lisp. Trying to make it work with .Net could be more work that simply
    rewriting the ObjectARX implementation to work with your new .Net code. You can
    have the ObjectARX method return an array of values that can be easily accessed
    by your .Net code.
