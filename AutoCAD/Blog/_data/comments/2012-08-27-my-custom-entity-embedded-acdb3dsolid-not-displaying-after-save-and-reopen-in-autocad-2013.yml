  body: Thanks a lot! Saved my day/week/month...I was afraid I had introduced a serious
    dwg filing bug into my project after upgrading it to 2013, although no error statuses
    suggested that this was the case. Please update the docs!

  body: 'Hi, I don''t understand one thing. Part about wrapper is OK, but I don''t
    understand where should I define that new protocol extension class (AcDbEmbeddedASMEntPropsPE)or
    is it already defined in acdb19.dll, because in version of my acdb19 I don''t
    have that class.


    Thank you'

    \ problem with AutoCad 2014. I created and saved file with my entity that contains\
    \ AcDb3dSolid. Then program failed when I tried to open that file, when AcDb3dSolid::dwgInFields\
    \ was called. Of course, I use EmbeddedSolidWrapper like before, and AcDb3dSolid::dwgOutFields\
    \ returnd eOK during save. Everything is OK for AutoCad 2013, but it doesnt work\
    \ for AutoCad 2014, so I woluld just like to know is anything changed for AutoCad\
    \ 2014?"

  body: I'm pretty sure VIEWBASE doesn't support custom objects (even more so for
    something derived from AcDbEntity). You could implement explode for your custom
    entity to explode it to an AcDb3dSolid and use VIEWBASE on that.

  body: "Stephen,\n\nExplode is not a good solution because it require to create new\
    \ 2d drawings every time I modify 3d model made of custom objects. My current\
    \ solution is creating in constructor new AcDb3dSolid, adding it to database and\
    \ store its Id as a class member. Then in modeldraw function I copy the geometry\
    \ of my embedded AcDb3dSolid to the one store in database. This solution however\
    \ is not the best because each element is duplicated and users has possibility\
    \ to delete the duplicated object that can cause a problem. Do you think is there\
    \ any other solution such as writing command myViewBase that unhide AcDb3dSolids,\
    \ run viewBase command and finally hide AcDb3dSolids? \n\n\n\nThanks in advance"

  body: 'We had an issue exactly like this years ago (where the solid was kept as
    an AcDb3dSolid* inside of another custom entity), and this solution was just what
    we needed.


    With the introduction of AutoCAD 2018, tho, it seems that somehow AcDb3dSolid
    entities that are appended to Anonymous blocks somehow lose their ASM data. (Or
    at this this is what I''m assuming is happening, since there is no way that I
    know of for a 3rd party developer to determine if the ASM data is there or not.)
    What I can say is this - we have drawings that are coming back from customers
    which have no 3D representations any longer. Looking through one of their drawings
    I discovered that the anonymous blocks that contain AcDb3dSolid entities are still
    present (along with the expected AcDb3dSolid entities themselves), everything
    is filing in and out as expected, yet AcDb3dSolids do not have geometry. (I verified
    this by opening them up and calling getGeomExtents on them. Everything I get back
    from that call is basically zeros).


    I''ve never seen anything like this before. And it seems to be happening only
    to entities that our app added to the drawing, yet there is nothing in the app
    to clear out geometries. (In fact I don''t even know of a way to clear AcDb3dSolid
    objects of their geometric information without deleting them entirely and replacing
    them with empty solids, which to my knowledge we don''t do).


    Any ideas why ASM data would disappear like that on entities appended to an anonymous
    block?'

  body: 'It should be emphasized that setIsEmbeddedEnt must be called on the embedded
    entity(s) both

    1) Before the entity is written out to the DWG/DXF file

    2) After the new entity is created but before dwgInFields/dxfInFields is called
    on the entity.


    In our application, the type of the embedded entity is not fixed (it could be
    AcDbRegion, AcDbLoftedSurface, etc.), and the type is determined by reading in
    an enum before the object. For this reason the embedded entity can''t be created
    and the embedded flag set in the custom entity constructor, as in the sample code.
    The flag was being set before writing out the entity, but not on the newly created
    embedded entity prior to calling dwgInFields. When trying to read a DXF, this
    would cause a message about an incorrect field in the DXF file. For a DWG, the
    program would take <b>OVER A MINUTE PER EMBEDDED ENTITY</b> trying to read the
    file, and then the import would fail anyway.'

  body: 'On a related note, if in the sample code you replace the embedded AcDbSolid
    with an AcDbLoftedSurface (I just created a simple one between 2 skew lines),
    the saving and loading from a DWG works fine, but trying to save to a DXF causes
    an exception (Access violation reading location) during the call to dxfOutFields
    on the embedded entity. Has anyone else run into this?
