  body: 'Hi Keith,


    There are few missing API in the .Net version of the AcDbGripData and AcDbDimData
    classes which prevents from doing the same using .Net. I have logged them in our
    internal database for our engineering team to look at these missing API.


    Sorry, it will not be possible to do the same at present using AutoCAD .Net API.

    Balaji'

  body: "So I think I have most of a wrapper created for this in order to get it to\
    \ work in c#.net. One of the last things that I think I need is a way to wrap\
    \ the setDimValueFunc. Is this possible?\n\nSo far in the header file I have:\n\
    \nAcad::ErrorStatus setDimValueFunc(\n\t\t\tDimDataSetValueFuncPtr funcPtr\n\t\
    \t\t);\n\nWhich doesn't work since .Net doesn't have the DimDataSetValueFuncPtr\
    \ object. Do you know of a a way to create a wrapper for it since it is looking\
    \ for this format for the function Ptr:\n\ntypedef void (*DimDataSetValueFuncPtr)\
    \ (AcDbDimData* pThis, AcDbEntity* pEnt, double newValue, const AcGeVector3d&\
    \ offset);  \n\nHere is a link to the c++ code I've created so far: <a href=\"\

  body: If I want to add the standard dynamic dimensions to my custom objects (AcDbPolyline
    derived), do I just add similar code directly to my objects handlers? Can I point
    at any existing base class implementation, or do I have to re-implement the basics?
    (I just want angle and length as 'normal')
