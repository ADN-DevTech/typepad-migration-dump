    how can you change the actual label of the Ribbon split button?  Mine always inherit
    the name of the first button.


    Ta,

    The button text and image is synchronized with the last selected button from the
    list because of the IsSynchronizedWithCurrentItem = true property. I guess by
    default it is synchronised with the first item and then changed when one of the
    buttons from the popup is clicked. Maybe you can override that somehow if that''s
    what you want.'

    Is it possible to have a static text with RibbonSplitButton, like it is with the
    cui editor. I''m using AutoCAD 2012 to 2014.


    Thank you.'

    Have you tried setting "IsSynchronizedWithCurrentItem" property of the Ribbon
    split button to false ?


    This will ensure that the split button always displays the same text regardless
    of what was selected.

    This is a nice post! :-) I just wondered if I have long name on my button, how
    do I control the length of text displayed?? and how can integrate it to a new
    custom cuix.


    Thanks,

    Zeus
