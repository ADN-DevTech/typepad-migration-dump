    I think that after explanation of Art Cooney (<a href="http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/Autodesk-ObjectARX/How-to-use-a-reactor-to-prevent-CAD-s-modify-command/m-p/3809644#M30007)">http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/Autodesk-ObjectARX/How-to-use-a-reactor-to-prevent-CAD-s-modify-command/m-p/3809644#M30007)</a>

    \ ways without using the overruling and so had included suggestions from a another\

    This was a very radical solution to removing the other suggestions from the blog
    post and have only retained the overruling method! :-)'

  body: ">>>> CGripOverrule::setIsOverruling(false);\n\nHi Balaji.\n\nSince Overrules\
    \ have appeared, I have been puzzled at how Autodesk could have provided a 'global'\
    \ switch that allows any application (managed or native) to completely disable\
    \ all overruling, application-wide.  \n\nYour example in this case, serves to\
    \ make my point, which is that setIsOverruling() is a massive screw-up.\n\nYour\
    \ code incorrectly calls it when you remove your overrule, and in doing so, <b>disables\
    \ all overrules in the application</b>. \n\nWell that certainly is radical, isn't\
    \ it?  :D\n\nSince when, does an API allow one application to corrupt, disable,\
    \ or interfere with other applications?\n\nPlease ask one of your collages who\
    \ may be more familiar with the design of the Overrule functionality, to please\
    \ explain how this could have happened."

  body: "Hi Tony,\n\nYou have rightly pointed out the issue with my code snippet.\
    \ I haven't considered the possibility of other overrules, which a production\
    \ code must definitely consider. \n\nA \"well-behaved\" :) plugin can check the\
    \ state of overruling using the \"isOverruling\" method even before it adds its\
    \ own overrules. Based on this information, it should only stop the application\
    \ wide overruling if no other overrule was initially active.\n\nIf any of the\
    \ plugins do not follow this, then it will be affecting the overrule of other\
    \ plugins.\n\nI dont think this is the first instance where AutoCAD is expecting\
    \ certain \"right\" behavior from plugins to prevent interfering with other plugins.\n\
    \nFor example, when working with AcEdInputPointFilter, the plugin needs to look\
    \ for other point filters and if they do exist then store a pointer to it and\
    \ forward calls to it.\n\nI am not aware of the reasoning for the design decision\
    \ behind having an application wide switch for overrules but these are my thoughts\
    \ on this topic.\n\n\n\n\n\n-----"
