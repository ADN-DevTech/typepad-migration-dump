  body: "I have an menu type app that uses PaletteSet also and is designed to be docked\
    \ horizontally between the AutoCAD drawing window and the Ribbon. Prior to AutoCAD\
    \ 2015, once the palette is docked, you could manually adjust the height of the\
    \ palette within the AutoCAD UI. However in 2015, this ability is no longer available.\
    \ \nUsing your WPF sample, I was able to duplicate this issue. I added + (int)DockSides.Top)\
    \ to your _ps.DockEnabled...after compiling it, I loaded it in AutoCAD 2014...it\
    \ will dock at the top and the palette height can be adjusted. In AutoCAD 2015,\
    \ only the width can be adjusted when docked to the side but if docked at the\
    \ top, the height is not adjustable. \nHopefully you can offer a solution to this?\n\
    \nThanks\nGary"

  body: "In the panel the block/DWG is not viewed after clicking preview drawing (and\
    \ selecting a DWG). \nIs seems there are some issues with:\nusing (BlockTableRecord\
    \ curSpace = db.CurrentSpaceId.Open(OpenMode.ForRead, true, true) as BlockTableRecord)\n\
    \                mPreviewCtrl.mpView.Add(curSpace, mPreviewCtrl.mpModel);\n\n\
    Problem:\n'ObjectId.Open(OpenMode, bool, bool)' is obsolete: 'For advanced use\
    \ only. Use GetObject instead'\n\nDoes anybody know how to solve this for AutoCAD\
    \ 2015?\n-----"
