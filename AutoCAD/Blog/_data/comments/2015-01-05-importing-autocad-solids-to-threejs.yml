    This works great. But for me FaceterMeshType = 0 instead of 2 and manually splitting
    the rectangluar faces into triangles like with the AcDbSubDMesh gives much better
    results. And it''s faster, too.

    Have you tried to add texture to the objects? Seems to be tricky.'

    It''s not perfect - works just fine with flat objects. But it at least allows
    me to display a texture. Would be better if it''s possible to directly get the
    UV data from the AutoCAD model.'
