  body: 'Thanks for comments. But blog post code works fine on AutoCAD version which
    works on framework like .NET 3.5 framework. Lot of developers still uses NET 3.5
    for AutoCAD 2010 & 2011.


    But I should thank you for your comments.

  body: 'The Author was showing how to use AutoCAD COM apis without importing the
    COM type libraries, which is problematic and often undesireable, because of COM
    versioning issues.


    In VB.NET, it is very easy to do the same (without importing the AutoCAD libraries),
    by simply declaring COM objects as System.Object, and using late-binding.'

    Can I use this way to create new points, like the "POINT" command.


    Thanks.'

    Yes, you can use late binding to call other functions too.
