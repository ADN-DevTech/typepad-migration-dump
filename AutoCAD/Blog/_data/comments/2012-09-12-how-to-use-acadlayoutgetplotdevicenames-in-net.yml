  body: "Yes there is, and I would say if you are running from a .Net dll in process\
    \ with AutoCAD, there is no point on relying on the ActiveX API for that. But\
    \ thing is we are migrating our old knowledge base once restricted to ADN members\
    \ to that public devblog, so you might see appearing articles that are a bit outdated,\
    \ although useful...  \n\nIn .Net you would do as follow:\n\nEditor ed = Autodesk.AutoCAD.ApplicationServices.Application.DocumentManager.MdiActiveDocument.Editor;\n\
    // Assign default return values\nstring devname = \"\"; \n\nPlotSettingsValidator\
    \ psv = PlotSettingsValidator.Current;\n\nStringCollection devlist = psv.GetPlotDeviceList();\n\
    for (int i = 0; i < devlist.Count; i++)\n{\n    ed.WriteMessage(\"\\n{0} {1}\"\
    , i + 1, devlist[i]);\n}\n-----"
