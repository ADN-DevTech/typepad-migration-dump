  body: "Hey... this is a brilliant bit of code. Thank you for sharing.\n\nI have\
    \ a couple questions. I'm trying to hi-jack the open command, but there are two\
    \ instances where the event is escaping me. \n\n1. When the drawing is opened\
    \ from Windows Explorer.\n2. When CAD starts in a zero document state (once a\
    \ drawing opens we're fine, before that has trouble though). \n\nAny thoughts\
    \ on intercepting these?\n-----"
