  body: The real Easter Eggs in Autocad 2014 are the inclusion of some very brutal
    bugs, like the Autocad 360 crap wich causes explorer to randomly crash, if you
    select not install it, in setup, it still installs, and when you remove it using
    "program and features" in control panel, it makes the property panel unusuable,
    showing blank or showing unrelated properties.

    otherwise,...this is a big hoax.


    if it''s true..this is too huge for user and company who buy over $5000 a license
    of AutoCAD for Commercial use.

    AutoDesk will get serious problems.'
