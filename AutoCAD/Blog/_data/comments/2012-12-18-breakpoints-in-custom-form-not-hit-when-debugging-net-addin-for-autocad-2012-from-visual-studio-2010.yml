  body: 'Sorry Matus - we can''t comment on future plans for our products in a public
    forum. If you''re an ADN member, then you can ask such questions in private using
    DevHelp Online, or maybe you''ve already asked them at one of our Developer Day
    conferences.


    Obviously, we''re working on this, otherwise we wouldn''t have created the FIBERWORLD
    and related sysvars. If/when we do ship AutoCAD without fibers, we''d obviously
    be fixing those fiberless operation issues we know about.'
