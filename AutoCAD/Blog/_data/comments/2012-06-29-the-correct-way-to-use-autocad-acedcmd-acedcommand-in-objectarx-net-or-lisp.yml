    Company lisps are with englich commands.....


    Is there a simple way allow english commands in the french version without having
    to reprogramme every lisp?'

  body: As far as I know, All AutoCAD versions recognize English commands, if they
    are prefixed with an underscore as in "_MOVE", "_COPY", etc.

  body: 'Tony is correct. If you''re writing any code that you expect to be used in
    more than one language version of AutoCAD, then you should use the ''global''
    command names and keywords - which are the English commands prefixed with an underscore.  If
    you find a command where that is not the case, then please report it to us as
    a bug.
