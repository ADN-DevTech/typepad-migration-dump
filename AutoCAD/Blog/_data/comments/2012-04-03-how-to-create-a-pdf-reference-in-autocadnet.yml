  body: 'Hello,


    Thank you for the code above. I''m working on an AutoCAD plugin and I need to
    implement -PDFATTACH, which I believe is what this does. Would you by any chance
    also know how to choose which PDF page to display? I don''t see any relevant functions/properties
    in the PdfDefinition and PdfReference variables.


    Thank you in advance,

    Christos Zambas'
