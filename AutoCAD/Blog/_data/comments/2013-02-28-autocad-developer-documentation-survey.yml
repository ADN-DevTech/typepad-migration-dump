    Hopefully you guys are finally convincing them to throw some more resources into
    documentation.'

  body: "Regarding ;  \n\n12. Would you like to access all AutoCAD developer documentation\
    \ online in a single location?  \n\nThis is misleading I think. Do you mean download\
    \ it all from one location and use locally\nor\nHave to access it on-line from\
    \ one location.\n\nThis is an important distinction.\n\nRegards\nKerry"

  body: Hi Jeff - It probably wasn't obvious in the announcement, but this is a survey
    created by our techpubs team. We're just publicizing it for them. They have been
    investing in the API documentation resources - this survey is so they can better
    prioritize their next phase of work.

  body: I started to take the survey, but had to stop because I had to review what
    was duplicate between the arx sdk docs and other help files that came with autocad,
    such as lisp and vba references. I'll try again, but I have to say that I feel
    these kinds of surveys are not useful. You need to know the level of person you
    are talking to when considering what to do with their answers. The answers from
    survey are better than nothing, but really not enough to use to defend a decision.
    There is also no opportunity to clarify anything, so you get questions like Kerry's.
    I would suggest a 15 minute phone interview of maybe 20 people Adesk tracks through
    time, would be far more useful. Let us know who those 20 are too (if they agree)
    so we can offer info to them. Pay them a bit but not so much they treat you nicer
    than they should.

  body: Thanks for the feedback James. I'm sorry you didn't like the survey, but we
    appreciate any information you care to provide - even if you only partially answer
    the questions. We'll have to agree to disagree on the usefulness of online surveys.
    Obviously, surveys like this are not the only data we use to make decisions -
    but they are nevertheless a useful tool when used in the appropriate context.

  body: 'Hey sir! I''m from Philippines currently studying as an Information Technology
    student. We are now creating a system that will be our project. We are making
    a 3D modeling system for bike. Can we ask for some codes for rotating a 3D objects
    in VB.Net or in other programming languages same with that of the autocad architecture?
    Thank you sir.
