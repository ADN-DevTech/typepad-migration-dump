    I''ve tried following in this blog, tested the python script inside Plant 3d.
    I made a catalog containing only the custom script and inserted it into my spec,
    the problem is Plant 3d won''t show the custom part even though I added it in
    my spec. Can you help me?'

    Is there a way to get the Parent Pipe OD on selecting pipe for Custom Support
    placement. The challenge is, if we give Parent Pipe Diameter as one of the Parameter
    in the script, there are chances that User changes it and it will create a non-matching
    geometry.
