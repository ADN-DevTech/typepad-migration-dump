    That sounds rather Windows specific... do you have a suggestion for the Mac as
    well? Thank you!


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: 'Hi Fenton,


    You suggestion above seems rather Windows specific. What would you advise using
    on the Mac? Have you ever tested FireBug in the Firefox browser? That is available
    on Mac as well, I see. Thank you!


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: Sorry, you can't use Firebug or similar. The reason is because the JavaScript
    API runs in-proc, which means that you need to be inside of AutoCAD to have access
    to it.
