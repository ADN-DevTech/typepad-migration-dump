  body: 'If one uses VS2013, the NuGet Package Manager dialog box is not able to find
    the AutoCAD.NET package. One has to use NuGet command line to install in ("install-package
    AutoCAD.NET"). With VS2012, though, the package can be found in NuGet Package
    Manager dialog box.


    After package is installed, all the referenced DLLs are correctly set with "COPY
    LOCAL" being "False", except for the reference to acdbmgdbreb.dll: its "COPY LOCAL"
    is set to "TRUE", which is wrong.'

    Do you mean you were not able to see Manage Nuget Packages in Nuget Package Manager
    ?

    I checked on Vs2013 , I can find package and installed too.'

    If I extend the search from "AutoCAD" to "AutoCAD .NET API" it simply returns
    every hit with .Net or API in the name, none of which seem to be AutoCAD related.'

    I don''t suppose it''s possible for the ADN team to do the same with the Inventor
    .NET API?

  body: "I have looked the newest AutoCAD.Net (Version 21.0.1). It doesn't set `CopyLocal`\
    \ to `false` for each its assembly. It is bad. Also current naming creates the\
    \ problem of forced updating. I.e. by default the  package will update the assemblies\
    \ to newer AutoCAD versions even if you don't want to use newer AutoCAD version\
    \ for your project. Therefore user are to use `-Version` key and be very attentive.\
    \ So, current naming of the package is bad too... Also, Autodesk didn't create\
    \ the packages for older AutoCAD versions (2009-2014 are interesting for me too).\
    \ \nPlease, test your packages before you will publish them on NuGet feed. To\
    \ solve the problems mentioned by me I created own packages here: <a href=\"https://www.nuget.org/profiles/Bush\"\
