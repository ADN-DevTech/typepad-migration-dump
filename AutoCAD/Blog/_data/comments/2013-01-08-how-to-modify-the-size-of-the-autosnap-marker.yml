  body: Gopinath, I'm curious why System and Environment variables are treated differently
    when it comes to casing. System variables appear to not be case sensitive, while
    Environment Variables appear to require strict adherence to CamelCasing. I've
    always enjoyed LISP's relaxed approach to casing. ;-)

  body: 'Hi Emmanuel,


    By definition environment variables are "A setting stored in the operating system
    that controls the operation of a program". So they are not governed by AutoLisp
    semantics.


    Cheers
