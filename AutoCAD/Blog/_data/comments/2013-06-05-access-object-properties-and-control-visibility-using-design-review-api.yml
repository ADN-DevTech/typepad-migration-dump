  body: 'Dear Partha,


    Where can I find the full source code for this sample, please?


    Are all the required components and all referenced .NET assembly DLLs provided
    by the DWF developer centre that you point to?


    <a href="http://www.autodesk.com/developdwf">http://www.autodesk.com/developdwf</a>


    If so, can you please tell us which components are required, since it includes
    a quite substantial list to explore.


    Thank you!


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    This code snippet is not part of the Sample codes posted in DWF developer centre
    <a href="http://www.autodesk.com/developdwf">http://www.autodesk.com/developdwf</a>


    However, I have now updated the blog post with details of all components you need
    to reference from Autodesk Design Review to build this C# .NET project.


    Hope this helps.


    Cheers,

    Is there any chance you can upload a buildable version as i cant get this to work.
    Based on your sample and references i can try and open a dwf but i get an error
    as below. The code sample doesn''t seem to include how the CExpressViewerControl
    is added to the form?


    Retrieving the COM class factory for component with CLSID {A662DA7E-CCB7-4743-B71A-D817F6D575DF}
    failed due to the following error: 80040154 Class not registered (Exception from
    HRESULT: 0x80040154 (REGDB_E_CLASSNOTREG)).'

    I used the code and it has worked perfect. But it can be done in reverse. That
