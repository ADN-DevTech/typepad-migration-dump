    \ do I enter the INSTALLDIR and AUTODESK lines?\nDo I need to run the second and\
    \ third lines before the msi? \nAre those DOS SET commands?\nWhen I type in the\
    \ first line (msiexec /i myapp.msi) it just runs the installer."

    As long as I'm posting, I'll add something else that's hopefully useful:\nAdd\
    \ \n/passive\nto the end of the msiexec string to get it to run silently.\nAFTER\
    \ thorough testing, of course!\n-----"
