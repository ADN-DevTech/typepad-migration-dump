  body: 'Thanks Fenton, does this work with AutoCAD OEM? Based on my (limited) observation,
    I could not find folders %APPDATA%/Autodesk/ApplicationPlugins and

    %ProgramFiles%/Autodesk/ApplicationPlugins where my OEM product is installed.


    Are there any other special folder where the AOEM.Exe will look for the bundle
    during its load?


    Many thanks.
