    code also prevents Unload/Reload, FYI.

  body: 'Hi Augusto


    do you know how to insert an image without it being an XRef?


    i.e. the image should be located in the AutoCAD drawing itself.


    any advice much appreciated.

    I believe the other way would be to PASTE SPECIAL, which creates an OLE object.
    I''m afraid this is not exposed as an API, you may be able to use P/Invoke as
    shown here <a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/autocad/2012/04/update-linked-ole-object-from-net.html">http://adndevblog.typepad.com/autocad/2012/04/update-linked-ole-object-from-net.html</a>
