    \ having an origin, a height and a width. \n\nI am trying to use your example\
    \ but I cannot follow how to calculate the value for radiusRatio (from 2.0 to\
    \ 0.5) and how to calculate the 100 (perhaps from -10 and 10?). \n\nWould you\
    \ be so kind and give me a hint? I am looking to your reply.\n\nBest reagards\n\

  body: 'Dear Kai Siegele,


    Sorry if the commented lines caused some confusion. The commented lines were only
    to inform that the Center cannot be set without having the start and end points
    defined. The values that I have taken are arbitrary and does not have any relation
    with the major axis of 100 that I have used in the working code.


    Here is the explanation of the working code :

    Major Axis = 100 units

    So, major axis points will be (-100, 0) and (100,0)


    Radius ratio is 0.5 which makes the minor axis = 50

    So, minor axis points will be (0, 50) and (0, -50)


    Hope this clarifies and let me know if you have any specific queries on this topic.
