    the dxf-options don''t show up!

    It is very important to me since I must write dxf-files and for that purpose I
    am making drawings with needed content which then serves as template for writing
    the appropriate dxf-file. Thanks'

  body: 'Hi

    I feel you can achieve this by using wblock API.

    First, create a new database from selected entities using wblock. Refer <a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/autocad/2012/06/wblock-creating-new-drawing-from-selected-objects.html">http://adndevblog.typepad.com/autocad/2012/06/wblock-creating-new-drawing-from-selected-objects.html</a>
    .

    Now, use the new database to call dxout as shown in above post
