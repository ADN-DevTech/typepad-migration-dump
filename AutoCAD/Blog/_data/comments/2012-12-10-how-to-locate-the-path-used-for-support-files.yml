  body: "if the user intends to locate support file (acad.pgp), NOT the location for\
    \ roaming profile, then it is a bad suggestion to go RoamableRootFolder/roamablerootprefix.\
    \ Yes, AutoCAD default installationo does include some paths underneath roamable\
    \ root folder into its support paths. Only in this case it make sense to search\
    \ there for acad.pgp. However, the paths underneath roamable root folder may not\
    \ be included as support paths depending on how AutoCAD is set up in an office\
    \ (such as in my office, we have acad.pgp located in particular location). \n\n\
    So, again, if user asks where to find support file, not where his/her roamable\
    \ profile data, he/she should search AutoCAD support paths, which may or may not\
    \ include paths underneath roamable root folder."

  body: 'An easy way to access the current support path is to use the UserConfigurationManager
    as Kean Walmsley mentioned in his blog: <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2008/05/storing-custom.html">http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2008/05/storing-custom.html</a>


    Another way to find a file in the support path is to use the findfile function
    in Lisp.
