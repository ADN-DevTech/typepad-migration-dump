    I would like to test this new feature for loading some lisp files and a couple

  body: "Hi Greg,\n\nIf you follow the link in the above post to the information on\
    \ Kean's blog, then you should have all the information you need to create your\
    \ XML. Please let me know if there's some information you need missing from there.\
    \ \n\nUnfortunately, this blog won't allow me to quote XML in a comment, so I\
    \ can't post a specific example in this comment. But all you need to do in the\
    \ example XML above is to remove the StartupCommand=\"True\" parameter from the\
    \ Command element and add a LoadOnCommandInvocation=\"True\" parameter to the\
    \ ComponentEntry element. That will work for ObjectARX and .NET DLLs from AutoCAD\
    \ 2012, and for LISP from AutoCAD 2013.\n\nCheers,\n\nStephen"

  body: 'Hi Alex,


    Do you mean the source code for the .NET DLL in the bundle? I think I threw it
    away because it was really simple - it just defines a single command. You''re
    welcome to email me a simple bundle you''re having trouble with and I''ll take
    a look. I think you know my email address. (Or post the code on the Autodesk forum
    and tell me when its there).


    Cheers,


    Stephen'

    Sorry for the late reply. I somehow overlooked this comment. Your problem could

  body: Hmm... I have not been able to get this to work yet with autoloading. Even
    with the sample that you've provided. I am running AutoCAD R19.0.55.0. Is there
    anyone I can talk to about this?

  body: John and I discussed this offline. If you have the LAYER palette open, then
    it prevents the StartupCommand being invoked. Our engineering team have been informed.

  body: 'Hello Stephen,


    I''m using the Autoloader for my Apps. Since I tend to use several bundle''s it''s
    getting annoying to see all the balloon tips on loading them. Is there a way to
    turn off balloons? (ACA2012) Turning off the Infocenter is not an option. The
    Balloon setting in the reg for IC doesn''t seem to impact Autoloader Balloons...

    Thanks in advance,

    Daniel'

    so I noticed, that even if I change the IC-Balloon settings, they will set back
    to default on ACAD-Start...some config file somewhere...?

    Regards,

    I have the same issue with my custom bundles and our customer was asking if these

    the source files used to create SimpleTest.dll.  The xml definition of StartupCommand
    is only one part of the process.  As it is, I don''t know how to define the actual
    startupcommand such that AutoCAD finds and executes it.
