  body: Is there any way to read drawing properties without using any autocad api?
    I want to be able to access this data through the windows command prompt and by
    the same means as windows explorer is able to access it.

    Sorry, My apologies for failing to notice your comment to this blog post and the
    long delay in getting back to you.


    Please have a look at the DWG Properties ActiveX control from ADN Utilities. This
    should provide read-only access to some of the drawing properties even without
    AutoCAD installed in the system.


    This ActiveX can be downloaded as part of ADN Utilites from here :
