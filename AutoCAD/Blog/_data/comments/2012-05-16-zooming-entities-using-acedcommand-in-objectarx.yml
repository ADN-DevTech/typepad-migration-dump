  body: 'NEVER USE acedCommand IN ARX


    and why not post the real arx code to show how to get zoom done'

  body: 'Hi,


    Not sure why you think developer needs to avoid using “acedCommand”. In this case
    use of acedCommand will reduce the effort of the developers finding the extent
    and then setting the setting.

    Having said that, we will write similar post in future on zooming the entities
    without acedcommand.


    Thanks

    Viru'

    yes i know acedCommand is easy and quick solution.


    but i should say it is NOT a good solution,do u think so?'

  body: Patcon! "NOT good solution" and "NEVER USE" - these are two very different
    ideas. Agree? ;-)

  body: acedCommand is a very good solution to a lot of problems. Its an extremely
    powerful way to synchronously use the functionality provided by AutoCAD commands
    within your code. As a purist, you might prefer to write all your functionality
    from scratch, but (as a realist) why would I spend a long time reverse-engineering
    an AutoCAD command when I can use acedCommand and spend the time I save working
    on other code (or - better still - sitting by the pool sipping a cold beer).

    OK.never invent the wheel.

    but as i know acedCommand  will cause some unkown side effect,is that true?.'

  body: "Any API can cause unexpected results if you use it wrongly. But acedCommand\
    \ (or (command) in LISP) is a very mature API, and is safe to use as documented\
    \ in the ObjectARX helpfiles. \n\nPerhaps you got confused between ObjectARX and\
    \ .NET. P/Invoking acedCommand in a .NET plug-in could cause problems due to AutoCAD's\
    \ use of Fibers - which .NET doesn't support - so you have to use it with more\
    \ care there.\n-----"
