  body: 'Hi,

    I have a blockreference, position -95,0,0 and rotation 180 degrees. (block is
    created on 0,0,0 and then reference is insert at -95,0,0 and then rotate by 180
    degress).

    If I use its Matrix with your code : axis returned is 0,0,1 and angle PI.

    I expected that the values ​​returned were axis -1,0,0 and rotation 0.

    Thank you'
