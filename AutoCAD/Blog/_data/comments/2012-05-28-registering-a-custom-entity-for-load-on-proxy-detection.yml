  body: "It is my experience that leaving the first and last quote mark is necessary\
    \ to preserve white space within the string and keep things lined up:\n\nACRX_DXF_DEFINE_MEMBERS\
    \ (\n  MyEnt, AcDbEntity,\n  AcDb::kDHL_CURRENT, AcDb::kMReleaseCurrent, \n  AcDbProxyEntity::kNoOperation,\

  body: "Thanks for the comment, Owen.\nThe problem is that the quotation mark added\
    \ at the beginning will appear in the application name: \"MYAPP instead of MYAPP,\
    \ so probably AutoCAD will not find that application either.\nI just checked in\
    \ the watch window what string the sample code I pasted creates. Here it is: \n\
    MYAPP |Product Desc: My App |Company: My Company |WEB Address: www.mycompany.com\n\
    So it seems that the space characters are preserved.\t\nIf you modified the DXF_MACRO\
    \ to use ACRX_T(APP) instead of the original ACRX_T(#APP), then your extra quotation\
    \ marks would be necessary and would not show up in the string."

  body: 'Adam, what you say is correct, but you should test my assertion not by looking
    at the watch window, but by looking at what is displayed in the proxy notice dialog
    box. You should also perform a test with an actual registered application name
    rather than making assumptions about how AutoCAD parses the string.


    If you think I am wrong, please edify me via email, as this blog is inhospitable
    to conversation.'

  body: 'Just a final word after discussing this topic directly with Owen. He seems
    to be right in saying that if you want the information shown by the LIST command
    to be nicely formatted, then you should place the application information inside
    quotation marks - as he showed in his comment. Your application will still be
    recognised and the additional space characters will be kept in the string.

    Thanks, Owen!
