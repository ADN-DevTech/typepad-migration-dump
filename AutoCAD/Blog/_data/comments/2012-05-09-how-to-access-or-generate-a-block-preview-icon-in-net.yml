    Could you also show this functionality for AutoCAD 2013 .. I believe it may differ.

    Two remarks:

    1. With AutoCAD 2013 not acad.exe but accore.dll export function acedCommand

    2. Instead of "BLOCKICON" more correct using "_.BLOCKICON" in order to support
    localized version of AutoCAD'

  body: "I tried the code above in AutoCAD 2013, but the image files are 32*32 pixels.\
    \ \nI want the images to be larger. So I used \n<b>blk.PreviewIcon.GetThumbnailImage(64,\
    \ 64,\n (System.Drawing.Image.GetThumbnailImageAbort)(() => { return true; }),\
    \ IntPtr.Zero)</b>, \nand the image turned out to be very fuzzy. What could I\
    \ do. Like the block preview from CAD command INSERT dialog.\nBy the way, the\
    \ command BLOCKICON is shown in the CAD Console, can it be hidden?\nThanks!"

  body: "Is this working? ive tried it on 2013 with\n\nacedCommand(\n            \
    \    5005,\n                \"_.BLOCKICON\",\n                5005,\n        \
    \        <blockname>,\n                5000);\n\nand use accore.dll, but nothing\
    \ is happening. it just passes ton the code and still the previewicon is still\
    \ null."
