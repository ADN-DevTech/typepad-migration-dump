    The delay load + acrxLoadModule approach requires that the ARX doesn''t called
    any functions imported from the DBX before the acrxLoadModule call. This probably
    won''t be a problem if you call acrxLoadModule right away in acrxEntryPoint, but
    is something to watch out for since you could have code running prior to that.
    For example in constructors for globals. Also, delay loading isn''t possible if
    you''re using DLL imported data from the DBX.
