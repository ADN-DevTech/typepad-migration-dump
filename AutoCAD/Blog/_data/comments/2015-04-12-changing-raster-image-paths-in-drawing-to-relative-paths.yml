  body: 'In the .NET environment, if you try this where the total path length of the
    drawing (including the drawing name) plus the length of the relative path to the
    image, including the image filename, exceeds the 256 limit, then this will give
    an eFileAccess error.


    If you do the same test using the XREF palette and the right-click Path > Make
    Relative command, then it will work. So there seems to be a bug in the .NET API.
