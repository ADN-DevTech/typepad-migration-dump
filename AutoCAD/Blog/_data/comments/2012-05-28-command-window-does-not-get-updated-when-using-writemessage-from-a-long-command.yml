  body: 'This is a useful trick, but I have found using AutoCAD 2013 and VB 2012 that
    if I pass vbCr my message does not display whereas with vbCrLf it does.


    Is this new to this version?  I notice in most sample code, they use "/n" or vbCr,
    so it works for them . . .


    You may want to change the VB.NET note at the end of your example.  Thanks.'
