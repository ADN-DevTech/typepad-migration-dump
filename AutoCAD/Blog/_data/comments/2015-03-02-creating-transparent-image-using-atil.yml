  body: 'Hi Ranjan,


    I do not think, ATIL can read a .cal image format. The list of codecs in the ATIL
    folder does not have a codec for it. I can only find JFIF, JPG, PNG, TIFF and
    BMP codecs.


    Also, ATIL is a C++ only libary. If you want to use ATIL, you may need to create
    a C++ module and have it loaded in AutoCAD. You can then have your wrapper function
    invoked from .Net.


    Regards,

    Balaji'
