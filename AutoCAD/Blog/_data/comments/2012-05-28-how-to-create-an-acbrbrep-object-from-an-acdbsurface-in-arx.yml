  body: "Dear Philippe,\n\nThank you for this help full post.\nI used your process\
    \ and I would like to ask you what this line exactly does, as I could not find\
    \ ant relevant information in the documentation (for internal use only).\nAcad::ErrorStatus\
    \ es = pBody->setASMBody(pSurface->ASMBodyCopy());\n\nIn addition, I observed\
    \ that the pBody is not database-resident. For this reason, I had to add it first\
    \ to one block table record. \nCould you verify this step?\n\nKind regards,\n\
    Evangelos\n-----"
