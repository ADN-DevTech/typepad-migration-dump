    Haven''t you inadvertantly switched the order of the arguments in the call to
    appendloop? (That is, param. #3 should be ref verticesAcArray and param. #4 ref
    bulgesAcArray)


    And isn''t there another way of pinning memory in .NET, via GCHandle.Alloc, instead
    of unsafe/fixed?'

    \ my way, no leaks ever.  \n\nHave fun with this stuff :-)\n-----"
