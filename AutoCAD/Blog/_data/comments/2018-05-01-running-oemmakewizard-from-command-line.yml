  body: 'I''ve been running the command line for Make Wizard for a while but now I
    have (2) entries to a same PRODUCT but from different code streams Product 2018
    and Product 2019 but still building from the same OEM engine 2018. I have PROD.xml
    our 2018 Code and PROD2019.xml our 2019 code. In the IDE I can open the year specific
    and edit them, but the issue seems to be that the AOEMREG.exe is looking for a
    PROD.XML not the PROD2019.XML.



    Is it required to have the project files be PROD.xml since the registry doesn''t
    seem to point to the specific xml file except for the key.



    Help?'

  body: 'In case of someone is still facing the issue, there''s an important line
    missing in the Madhukar initial post (which has been added to his second post):


    call "%PROGRAMFILES(x86)%\Microsoft Visual Studio\2017\Professional\Common7\Tools\VsDevCmd.bat"


    I''ve experienced that missing this line was causing oemmakewizard complaining
    about invalid project name.


    Thanks Madhukar for your help, despite this little error, you really saved me
    hours.
