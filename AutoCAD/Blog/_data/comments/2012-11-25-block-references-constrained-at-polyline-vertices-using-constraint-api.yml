  body: 'Thanks! Finally there is an example where BlockReferences are attached with
    coincident constraints.

    Any ideas how to set the coincident point not to the blocks "base point" but to
    a custom point, e.g. from an entity within the block?


    Regards, Matthias'

  body: 'Balaji, thanks for your response. In the meantime I worked with Phillipe
    Leefsmas High-Level-Api &quot;AssocUtil&quot;: <a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/autocad/2013/01/a-simplified-net-api-for-accessing-autocad-parameters-and-constraints.html">http://adndevblog.typepad.com/autocad/2013/01/a-simplified-net-api-for-accessing-autocad-parameters-and-constraints.html</a>

    Thanks to Phillipe who recently updated this great util - it also works with polyline
    and blockreferences now :-) To create a coincident constraint, all you need is
    to choose the entities and define the points where they should meet. The util
    itself looks for the closest point (vertex/edge) in the nested entities that can
    be applied with the constraint.'

  body: 'Hi Matthias,


    Thanks for the update.


    I had tried it with the earlier version of the AssocUtil that was posted in Keans
    blog and it did not work.


    I am glad it works with the updated version that Philippe has posted.


    I will convey your appreciation to Philippe.


    Cheers,

    Balaji'

    I hope there is a solution as I really want this to work out!
