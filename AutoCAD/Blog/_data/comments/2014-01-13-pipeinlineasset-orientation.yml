  body: Thanks for the great write up.  On most parts the code works but I get odd
    results when trying to change the orientation of olets.  The olets always skew
    off the input vectors by 8-15 degrees.  Is there a reliable way to change olet
    orientation?

    Not sure if I''m following the idea. This sample rotates on the direction and
    along the direction of the part. Do you have more information or a sample? The
