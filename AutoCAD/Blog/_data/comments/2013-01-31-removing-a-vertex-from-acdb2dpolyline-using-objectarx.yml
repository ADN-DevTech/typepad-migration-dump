  body: 'Hi Fenton,


    what I don''t understand in your code is the check to see if a vertex was erased
    already. Does the 2d-Polyline not "let go" of Vertices that are erased? Does it
    keep the ObjectIds of aaaaall vertices it ever had?


    The reason why I''m asking is because I''ve written a function SetPolyline2dCoordinates
    in .NET.. and I implemented it by erasing all existing vertices and then appending
    the new coordinates with AppendVertex.

    Of course, when I read the vertices of a 2d-Polyline that I modified with SetPolyline2dCoordinates,
    I get "E_WAS_ERASED" errors etc.


    I''d be glad if you could clarify things for me a bit :)

    Thanks in advance!

    thanks for your reply. I see now why the object stays around, being marked as
    erased.

    If you do have five minutes, I''d be glad if you could look over my two methods
    to get/set the coordinates/vertices of a Polyline2d-entity and tell me if that
    code is okay or downright wrong :D

    as I have mentioned before in my Tools for the Job (starting at Part 3 Performance
    <a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/autocad/2012/07/the-right-tools-for-the-job-autocad-part-3.html)">http://adndevblog.typepad.com/autocad/2012/07/the-right-tools-for-the-job-autocad-part-3.html)</a>
    don''t use StartTransaction() for utility functions. The overhead for calling
    StartTransaction() is huge, instead, use StartOpenCloseTransaction()


    My personal preference is to use Open/Close directly.'

  body: 'Hi Fenton,


    okay, gotcha :) One last question (then I''ll stop getting on your nerves :P):
    In part 5 of your blog series "The Right Tools for the Job" you mentioned that
    "The Transaction model (StartTransaction()) was invented way back when for a specific
    reason - transacting multiple writes on the same objects(s) and allowing layered
    rollbacks of these multi-write transactions."


    Am I correct when I assume that multiple writes means writes to one object from
    multiple threads? As my application is purely single threaded, I think I could
    safely use StartOpenCloseTransaction everywhere...



    Thanks for sharing your opinion!


    Best Regards
