  body: "The outcome of this code is wonderful but many of us aren't a big fan of\
    \ COM. We prefer to customize AutoCAD in plain C++ without COM. If one of you\
    \ could show how to arrive at the same outcome using the non-COM property system,\
    \ then it would be great. \n\nI think it would be very helpful if Autodesk should\
    \ provide relevant sample codes aside from the cryptic documentation of the new\
    \ AcRx classes like AcRxCollectionProperty, AcRxIndexedProperty, AcRxDictionaryProperty,\
    \ etc."
