    Can you confirm if Edit and Continue in debug still does not work on a 64 bit
    platform.

    What is it? I have MS VS 2012 x64 & AutoCAD 2013 SP1.1 - I can check it now.

    I guess, I will have to stick with my old XP machine for development. But it also
    has advantages. It''s so slow, that it forces me to look into optimization in
    the places, where it won''t come to mind on a faster machine :)'

  body: Just curious... doesn't AutoCAD run on a three-year cycle regarding binary
    compatibility?  And doesn't that affect the version of Visual Studios that you
    use as well?  If that's so, then what is the next major release and when should
    we expect VS 2010 to become an issue?

  body: There's a difference between being forced to upgrade your compiler and being
    able to do so if you want to. VS2012 with Acad2013 is a case of the latter. For
    your specific question - sorry, but I can't talk about product futures in a public
    forum, but we'll be presenting information on futue releases through the ADN website
    and at our ADN DevDays conferences as usual.

  body: 'If you hover your mouse over each one of those, you''ll see that each is
    for a different language. That just means that the help text associated with the
    interfaces is localized for each one. AutoCAD installs all the language versions.


    But you shouldn''t be referencing these directly from a .NET application - you
    should be referencing the Interop DLLs shipped with the ObjectARX SDK, and using
    type embedding so you don''t have to ship the Interop DLL with your application.
