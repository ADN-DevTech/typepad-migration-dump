    simply check out the arxref.chm in the ObjectARX SDK. That''s where you will find
    detailed documentation for ObjectARX AND the corresponding .NET functions.'

  body: 'Hi Fenton,


    I used your code to show a dialog box if an object is doubleclicked in the drawing.
    Everything works fine but if there is a button at the point the user doubleclicked,
    the button respectively the dialogbox gets a click event. Have you an idea to
    suppress this?


    Regards,

    Peter'

    I did some more research about the problem and found the solution. Unfortunately
    I used the MouseUp event instead the Click event. After change of the event type,
    erverthing works fine! Nevertheless, thank you for the helpful code sample!
