  body: "Hello, \nvery useful code snippet!\n\nHowever, I just tried it with AutoCAD\
    \ Mechanical 2015 and 2017, and it seems, that the system variable THUMBSIZE does\
    \ not affect the size or resolution of the preview image saved under \"C:\\\\\
    Temp\\\\FirstFloor.bmp\".\n\nIs this the indended behavior?\n\nHave a nice day!"
