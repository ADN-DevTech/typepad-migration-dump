  body: 'Hi Khoa,


    For Exchange store apps, we recommend you use the Autoloader mechanism I''ve described
    in earlier posts. If you do that, then we will create the installer for you. (Or
    if you''re not posting to the store, then you can create a simple MSI using VS
    that just copies your bundle to %appdata%\Autodesk\ApplicationPlugins or |programdata%\Autodesk\ApplicationPlugins.
    No registry access is required.


    For a non-Autoloader installer, you have a lot of work (which is why we created
    Autloader). I suggest you watch this old webcast - <a href="http://download.autodesk.com/media/adn/AutoCAD-Creating_an_Application_Installer.zip.">http://download.autodesk.com/media/adn/AutoCAD-Creating_an_Application_Installer.zip.</a>
    (See the whole webcast archive at <a href="http://www.adskconsulting.com/adn/cs/api_course_webcast_archive.php).">http://www.adskconsulting.com/adn/cs/api_course_webcast_archive.php).</a>'

  body: 'Thanks Stephen, I now understand why many apps on the Exchange Store have
    the same installation interface, as Autodesk has the Autoloader mechanism helping
    to create the installer. Otherwise developers have to make their own MSI packages
    and write to Windows registry info of the loader files. Phew, LOTS of good stuffs
    on the DevBlog to read recently! Thank you.
