  body: 'Hi Tony,


    The file extension can be renamed, so a user can change it to .DWG and then cause
    this examination to fail. Yes if the call to save the drawing come from an API
    call, then will not work either, but at least this type of call is under your
    control.


    Thanks for the comment.

    Sorry for dredging up older post''s. We have tapped into the DocumentManager.DocumentLockModeChanged
    event to see various things and prevent commands from running during certain times
    in our application.


    The DocumentLockModeChangedEventArgs parameter has a .GlobalCommandName property
    that shows us when "AUTO_SAVE" is being called during one of our routines. This
    is easy to prevent as there is also a Veto() function to cancel the "AUTO_SAVE".
    We also set a flag when the "AUTO_SAVE" has been Veto()''d so we can trigger a
    QSAVE as soon as our command has completed.


    My question is, using .Net, is there an way to trigger a call to "AUTO_SAVE" directly.
    QSAVE does not seem to be the same thing and takes longer in some cases. Is there
    something we can maybe dll import from arx? I have tried the typical ways to call
    "AUTO_SAVE" as a command and it is not recognized as a command. Again the GlobalCommandName
    property shows its name is "AUTO_SAVE" but I believe that is just a false name
    that does not correlate to an actual registered command name.


    Thank you,

    Sorry to bother you, I want to ask a question.

    How can I have a fixed time of AUTOSAVE and users can not change it by themselves?


    Thanks'

    You can track if this sysvar change (by the user), if so, change back to the original
    value. As this is a setting (under OPTIONS), you cannot avoid it being changed,
    but you can change it back.

  body: 'So, what is finally the best way to catch the AUTO_SAVE "event"?


    As Stuart Elvers said and I have tried it, CommandWillStart event doesn´t work
    with e.GlobalCommandName="AUTO_SAVE"


    I would prefer not to use DockLock event because there is a huge amount of scenarios
    when that event is fired.


    Thanks.
