  body: Yes you can, but no you shouldn't ignore them. E.g. the warning you posted
    means that the import redefined the close function. Thus there's no more way to
    close a file after you've opened it, and any code calling the close function might
    error - because it's now using the close method from your DLL instead of AutoLisp's
    built-in close defun.

  body: Thank you for the comment. I agree. Maybe there is a misunderstanding here?
    I said you "should avoid", which is sort of the opposite of "should ignore" :)
