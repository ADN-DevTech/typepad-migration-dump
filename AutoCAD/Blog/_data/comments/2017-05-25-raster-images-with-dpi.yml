  body: in my experience, the .net approach runs out of memory fast for larger images.
    Things like imagemagick are more robust (and free) solutions, but not sure if
    they do the tagging like that. Either way, a very useful article so thank you!

    I agree, generally in image processing, most sort out approach is use ImageMagick
    like framework which are written in C++, they play at very low-level manipulating
    the bytes of Image buffer.
