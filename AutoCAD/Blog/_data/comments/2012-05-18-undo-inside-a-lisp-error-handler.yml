  body: 'I''m assuming the reason is that there might be a command active?


    I was using the following to get around that issue:


    (if (= 0 (getvar "cmdactive")) (command "undo" "1" "regen"))


    With my method the command line is clean when CMDECHO is 0. With vla-SendCommand
    I''m not sure if there is a way to suppress all the command line echoing.
