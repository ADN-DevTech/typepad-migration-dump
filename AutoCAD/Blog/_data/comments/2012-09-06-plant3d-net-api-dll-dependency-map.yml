  body: Thank you, Fenton! Do you have some samples to post? I have tried a couple
    C# examples from the samples folder but none seem to work. Although, they don't
    error either. :S - I am trying to write out the extended data to a database. I
    can connect to the db, just not the extended data. If this has no place here please
    kindly disregard. :)
