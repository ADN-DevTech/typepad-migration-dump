    This blog post is only relevant when you want change the setup icon which appears
    in your product installer. If you are trying to get an icon set for your product
    then you will need to follow the steps provided in the OEM developer''s guide
    and change IDR_MAINFRAME. After you click on Browse button, select both your product
    exe and AcBrandRes.dll paths.
