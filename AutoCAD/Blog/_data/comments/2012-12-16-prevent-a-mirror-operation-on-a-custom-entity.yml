  body: Thanks for sharing, and my wife and I are thinking about getting custom mirrors
    for our bathrooms in our home.  And we're thinking about getting them made from
    <a href="http://www.careflections.com">http://www.careflections.com</a> we just
    still deciding whether or not we want to go.

  body: I have been looking into getting a custom mirror for my house and I was just
    wondering if the site I found is the best for what I am looking for. They look
    really promising and really know what they are talking about. www.careflections.com

  body: "As in many homes, I have a plain big mirror in my master suite. I am wondering\
    \ if you were able to add a custom frame to it for me? I want a big chunky frame\
    \ with detail, if at possible. I think it adds a lot of character to the bathroom.\n\
