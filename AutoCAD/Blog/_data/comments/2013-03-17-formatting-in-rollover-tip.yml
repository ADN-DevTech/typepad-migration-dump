    But it is not working with .Net the same way. Using "AppendToolTipText" just shows
    the above XAML-Code.

    Is there a way to achieve this with .Net?'

  body: 'Hi Mario,


    I tried the code from a .Net PointMonitor event handler in AutoCAD 2013. It worked
    ok when the mouse was hovering over an entity and the text got displayed as it
    is when I did not hover over an entity.


    So a check for the "e.Context.GetKeyPointEntities" before using the "AppendToolTipText"
    should help.

  body: There is an issue with this when it comes to multiple entities being hovered
    over. When this happens AutoCAD decides to show the old drafting tool tip and
    shows the xaml in the tool tip. I was wondering if there is anyway to detect that
    this will happen in this situation?

  body: "Hi Ferdinand,\n\nSorry, We do not yet (as of AutoCAD 2014) have a way to\
    \ format the tooltips without relying on internal API or workarounds. The sample\
    \ code explained in this blog post is a woraround and has limitations and does\
    \ not work in ACA and some other verticals. Unfortunately, I do not see a way\
    \ to resolve this when hovering over multiple entities. \n\nAn alternate approach\
    \ to show a formatted rollover tool tip, is to use the \"Autodesk.Windows.ComponentManager.ToolTipOpened\"\
    \ event handler and replace the Tooltip content with your own WPF control. This\
    \ approach uses the internal API but I hope this helps. I haven't tried this,\
    \ but this seems to work ok as suggested by Keith Brown in this forum post :\n\
