    How does one successfully add a RibbonTab to Main CUI via Initialize(), so that
    it (the custom RibbonTab) is available prior to partial CUIx being loaded via
    Autoloader?


    Multiple Autoloader plug-ins with partial CUIx targeting the same custom Alias,
    if the custom RibbonTab has not been added to Main CUI first, then each partial
    CUIx displays it''s own RibbonTab instead of adding to custom RibbonTab in Main
    CUI.


    Please advise.'

    I''m aware that one cannot actually modify the Ribbon on Initialize()... In practice
    I use Initialize() to hook Application.Idle (not sure why I neglected that above,
    but still).




    In any event, essentially (if I am understanding you correctly), Autoloader is
    incapable of successfully allowing for a plug-in to modify Main CUI prior to the
    loading of a given .bundle''s CUIx partial(s) so that RibbonTab''s with matching
    Alias can properly be merged into single tab... AutoCAD has no work around for
    the Main CUI dependency... And instead, I need to delay the loading of my plug-in''s
    UI components to call SendStringToExecute (effectively, if not literally), just
    to get my custom ComandMethod to modify Main CUI prior to programmatically loading
    my .bundle''s CUIx partial(s).


    ... Any insight on when that mess... And the ''residue'' duplication of .bundle
    CUIx files being replicated to each-and-every-installation''s ..\Support\ folder...
    Are going to be addressed?

    Yes, this is a known behavior and for any cui related changes to take effect,
    we either need to reload the cuix. I have also seen in the past that changing
    WSCURRENT also helps.

    Please try the "savecui" method from this blog post and see if that helps without
    having to change the current workspace.

    It sounds like you omitted the acApp.ReloadAllMenus() call and that caused the
    problem.

    I assume that the problem is that I missed out the "using acApp = Autodesk.AutoCAD.ApplicationServices.Application;"
    statement (because that was at the top of my file) and that caused the confusion.

    I''ll add it to the code to make things clear.
