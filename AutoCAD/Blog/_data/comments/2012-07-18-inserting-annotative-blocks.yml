  body: 'Hi,


    Reading through this post and then trying the code out for myself, i find that
    if the file(block) being imported contains a AMPartRef this sometimes comes in
    and adds the part to the BOM and sometimes doesn''t add the part to the BOM.


    Is there a specific requirements on the way you handle a block definition import
    when a AmPartRef is concerned?


    Interestingly if the Definition already exists (Via typing Insert the adding the
    block) The method of inserting the block reference into the drawing described
    above works perfectly!'

    This code is not doing anything specific to this kind of block... and I''m not
    sure if I got your question :)
