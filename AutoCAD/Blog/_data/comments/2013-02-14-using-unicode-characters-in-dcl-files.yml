  body: 'Hi Alexander,


    Thanks for the comment.


    I have just tested it in AutoCAD 2013 _VERNUM "G.114.0.0 (UNICODE)" (read only)
    and things seem to work. I''ll update the above post in a second with my files
    and info on what I did so you can test it on your side.


    Cheers,

    Adam'

  body: 'Hi, Adam! You''re absolutely right. Thank you! This mistake was in AutoCAD
    without Service Pack 1.1

    I checked that with AutoCAD 2013 SP 1.1 still displays ANSI DCL-files are not
    correct, and not thought to check UTF-8 DCL-files in the VLX-files. Now I''ve
    checked it and it is all right!'
