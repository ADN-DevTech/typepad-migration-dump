  body: 'The documentation online now specify the attribute HelpFile like Helpfile
    and when ''f'' is in lower case F1 will not work.


    The HelpTopic attribute is not documented well either. It just says: "Help topic
    to open when the command is active and F1 is pressed."


    AppName attribute for ComponentEntry is mandatory for cuix files but is not documented.
    If not used you get an error like: Autoloader is missing an appName for module
    name ./Contents/whatever.cuix


    Is really Version="1.1.1" needed for ComponentEntry with the cuix file? If so
    it is not in the documentation right now.'

    \ for a ComponentEntry. \n\nBut Version is optional for a ComponentEntry.\n\n\

  body: 'Is there a secret to getting the HelpTopic working? The HelpFile displays
    as expected but the #suffix is not appended to the address string.


    Hyperlinks in AutoCAD have never respected the #suffix (at least for our office
    set up), I assume that this is probably related.
