    and your blog articles will be a big help!

  body: 'Hi Stephen!

    Great news! Now I have not think may I tell others about some algorithm on the
    forum or it will break NDA, because I found the solution in the DevNote :-)

    Some comments to blog engine:

    1) I discovered that the code is not always displayed correctly and the ends of
    long lines "eaten". It would be nice if the code also is attached (as a zip or
    plain text) to the post.

    2) Unfortunately, code in comments are also distorted.'

    Thanks for the effort .. it''s sure to become a valuable resource.


    In light of the binary compatability and changing API issue ; it may be worthwhile
    adding a note regarding the applicable versions the code/comment applies to ...
    similar to the headers to the ADN  DevNotes.


    Regards and thanks
