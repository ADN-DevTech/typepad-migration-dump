  body: When you use the VS 2008 migration wizard, it inserts a special "Inherited
    project property sheet" (in the top section of the General configuration properties)
    that intends to create the same project defaults that were active in the older
    version of VS. You may find that simply removing that inherited property sheet
    in your migrated project will result in new default settings that are more optimal,
    and therefore require fewer project specific overrides.

  body: '"Never assume you have the best Visual Studio Release mode performance settings
    for your ObjectARX application."


    That''s a very good advice indeed!


    I''ve just spent a few time looking at samples optimization and tuning my projects
    properties, I''ve so realized how bad they were. I''ve still not sized gain precisely
    but it seems it improved some processes slightly.


    Thanks'
