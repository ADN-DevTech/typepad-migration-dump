  body: "you need commit the transaction always, even it's just reading/querying data.\
    \ Otherwise, there will be performance issue, especially in 3d layout. you may\
    \ try the following code:\nAcadDoc acadDoc = AcadCore.DocumentManager.MdiActiveDocument;\n\
    for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++)\n{\n        using (Transaction tran = acadDoc.Database.TransactionManager.StartTransaction())\n\
    \        { }\n}\nIt takes more than 20 seconds in 3D layout."

  body: Absolutely Renbo. Only abort (or fail to commit) a transaction when you specifically
    want to roll back the changes you made.

  body: "Just a little clarification please... Renbo was referencing committing a\
    \ transaction even on read and said there would be performance impacts if not?\
    \  You said yes, but references \"changes\".  Is it really better to commit even\
    \ on read (with no changes)?  \n\nAlso (if you don't mind), if for example you\
    \ have nested methods sharing a transaction, how would you know if it's been committed\
    \ already without causing an InvalidOperationException from the internal/private\
    \ Transaction.CheckTopTransaction() validation?  Maybe I've overlooked a property,\
    \ but I couldn't find one that would help."
