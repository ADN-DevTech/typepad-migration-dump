  body: "Hi Matus,\n\n\"c:myfunc\" is a VLisp command but (defun c:) registers the\
    \ command in a different command registry than the one Lisp '(command)' uses.\
    \ \n\nFor this reason, (command \"c:myfunc\") does not work.\n\nThe post explains\
    \ a way to make a function callable using (command \"name of the func\")"
