    I was testing the AccoreConsoleDemo application and on the custom tab I am trying
    to netload a custom .dll from the network but getting the error:


    Could not load file or assembly.


    Is loading from network not supported?


    Thanks,

    Sorry, I haven''t tried this with accoreconsole.


    I will give it a try and let you know based on what I find.


    Meanwhile, can you please try this suggestion and see it helps ?

    I have come across such issues where a netload doesnt work inside AutoCAD. In
    such cases, running the caspol solves the issue.


    CasPol.exe -m -ag 1.2 -url X://Acad/TrustedAssemblies/* FullTrust


    Because it is working inside AutoCAD, I am not sure what else to suggest.


    If you can help me reproduce the problem, I can investigate this.


    Also it might help if you can try with another network share to see if it specific
    to a network location.'

    Sorry, that would not be possible in Accoreconsole. RText is a custom entity from

    If possible, you can have Rtext in such drawings exploded as regular text and

    About writing scripts - There is no documentation on it, but it is simple to create
    it.

    Just try all the commands (both native AutoCAD commands and your custom commands)
    in the sequence that you want them to run along with any inputs that you want
    to provide. Copy them to a text file and name it as a .scr file.


    Here is a nice blog post explaining the steps :

    I have just started using accoreconsole and it seems like it should be the right
    tool for what I need.


    However, I am having issues with accoreconsole.  I am currently running Map 3D
    2023 and I also have Autodesk 2022 installed.  When I attempt to run accoreconsole
    from the "C:\Application Files\Autodesk\AutoCAD 2023\" it opens then quickly closes.  When
    I try the version in the 2022 folder it opens but it doen''t seem to be working
    correctly.  I have a testing lsp, "Hello.lsp".  When I open the console and enter
    (load "C:\\temp\\hello.lsp") I get this in the window "error: File load canceled:
    C:/Temp/hello.lsp".  I can open Map and use the commandline to successfully load
    the same Lisp file (using the same format).  The Lisp file itself works.


    I had some issues with MAP before and my company''s IT provider uninstalled and
    then re-installed Map.  I have been learning/programming C# and .Net using Visual
    Studio.


    What I am hoping to get from you folks are directions to correctly trouble-shoot
    this issue.  I don''t know if I should be looking for a corrupt/miss-addressed
    files, the accoreconsole dependents files and links, a faulty flux-capacitor or
    even if there is something in the Registry I should look at.


    Thank you.
