  body: 'Hi Stephen,


    I would like to introduce a new technology to program AutoCAD with C# scripts
    in real-time like JavaScript (in AutoCAD 2014), AutoLISP and DesignScript. Do
    I have a chance to present it on AU? It is my programming concept and on the way
    of improvements.


    Thank you,

    Khoa

    You certainly have a chance. And we''re always keen to give new presenters a chance
    at AU. Your class proposal will be evaluated on its merits against all the other
    proposals - so make sure you take care with your class description and supporting
    information. (We normally get about three times as many ''Developer'' class proposals
    as we have space for, so some good proposals always end up not making the cut).


    Cheers,


    Stephen'

    I am very excited with new technologies and future of AutoCAD on the cloud. I
    am seeking for development supports as my programming concept is my side project
    after work and I need more developer attentions to make it more mature. It will
    be very interesting that the future AutoCAD automation will be driven from the
    web and distributed third-party apps from the cloud without installation.


    Thanks,

    Does AU 2013 allow developers outside the ADN Dev Team to present programming
    topics at AU? I am working on Node.js/JavaScript and RealDWG/AutoCAD .NET and
    can''t wait to show up many new exciting technologies. I already put my app to
    Autodesk Exchange Apps store.


    Thanks,

    Anyone can submit an AU proposal - for any of the tracks including the Developer
    track - its not limited to Autodesk employees. However, competition is fierce,
    so submitting a proposal does not guarantee that your class will be accepted.


    Cheers,
