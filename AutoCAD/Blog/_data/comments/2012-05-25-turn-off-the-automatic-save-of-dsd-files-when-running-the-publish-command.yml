  body: I accidentally said "yes" the first time it asked me if I wanted to save the
    .dsd file.  Is there a way that I can reverse my decision?

  body: I'm having this issue as well, and the part above in your solution where it
    says... Save Sheet List  checkbox.  Check it and click Ok all the way out of options.
    I don't see that option in the hidden messages. Maybe I'm on the wrong tab. I'm
    on the system tab under General options is where my hidden message tab appears.
    Is that correct?
