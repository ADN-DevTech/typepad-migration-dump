  body: 'How convert the modal dialog "this" to System.IntPtr for use with editor
    staruserinteraction.


    I''m trying with "Me", the error is:

    Value of type ''App-namespace.Dialog1''cannot be converted to ''System.IntPtr''.


    Using forms instead of dialogues generates the same error.'

  body: "Hello,\nI am very new to ObjectArx and trying to learn by example.\nCould\
    \ you possibly explain how can I make a modal dialog disappear (as in the example\
    \ above), then click in the desired location in the Editor (which may or may not\
    \ contain an entity) and return the clicked coordinates back to my C# app. I intend\
    \ to use it to simplify entering the coordinates into the external database by\
    \ snapping to points chosen by the user. \nThanks!"

    \ as you said you are new to programming, I will suggest you to go through the\

  body: 'Hello, I''m having problem with ED.StartUserInteraction.


    When WindowsForm (modal form) is maximized and I click the button that requires
    data on the command line, the WindowsForms closes unexpectedly.


    I tried to work around the problem with the event below, but it still fails:


    Private Sub me_FormClosing (sd As Object, evt The FormClosingEventArgs) Handles
    Me.FormClosing

    If evt.CloseReason = CloseReason.None Then

    MsgBox ("FormClosing User Intercation Error ...")

    evt.Cancel = True ''try to cancel "close"


    end If

    end Sub
