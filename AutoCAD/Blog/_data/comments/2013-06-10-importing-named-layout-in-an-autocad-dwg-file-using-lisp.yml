    \ . in some cases i have to mirror the xref BUT the problem is that the text mirrored\
    \ also. i try mirrtext command to solve the problem but nothing happened.\nis\
    \ there is a way or Lisp to mirror Xref’s without mirroring text with it ? \n\n\

  body: 'you can duplicate your texts, put them in two layers, one set of text will
    be backwards

    then, in the mirrored xref, you will turn on the layer with backwars texts

    this requires, that the texts are justified to center, otherwise, they will be
    moved, when changed to backwards (or you will have to reposition them, which might
    be a lot of work)'
