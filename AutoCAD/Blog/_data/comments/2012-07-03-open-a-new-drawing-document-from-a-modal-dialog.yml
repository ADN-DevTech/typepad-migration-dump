    That is like opening a drawing from a modeless dialog, so that is OK.

    One thing to also think about is placing the application logic inside a command
    instead of  inside a modeless dialog/palette set''s button click handler and then
    just calling the command from there using SendStringToExecute() - as mentioned
    above the command should be registered with the Session flag.


    Cheers,

    Adam'

  body: 'Hi, Adam.


    I create custom palette with one button on which pressing I cause the following
    code


    DocumentCollection dm = Platform.ApplicationServices.Application.DocumentManager;

    acDoc = dm.Open(fName);


    If I previously close all drawing and press this button I recieve AccessViolation
    inside CRT after opening this file.


    Could you help me to anderstand this situation.


    Cheers,

    Vyacheslav'

    I tried it in AutoCAD 2011 and it seemed to work fine. I wonder what is causing
    the difference on your system.


    Maybe you could post a question about it on the forums with a small sample project
    that reproduces the issue?

    Also providing the exact error message you get?

    Someone might have run into the same behaviour and could comment on that there.


    Cheers,
