  body: "Hi\n\nexplodeToOwnerSpace function works similar to “explode” function, except\
    \ that it appends the resulting entities to the block that owns the reference\
    \ on which this method was called. \nThis API also, retains the xdata attached\
    \ to basic entities which constituted the block.  \n\nThanks\nViru"

  body: 'Hi,


    Yes, there is no big difference between two functions except one (explode) returns
    a array of in-memory objects and other (explodeToOwnerSpace) adds the objects
    directly to database.


    Thanks

  body: "The code posted here is a simple usage example. It adds the exploded entity\
    \ collection to the current space, so it is basically reproducing the functionality\
    \ of ExplodeToOwnerSpace. In many cases you'll use Explode when you don't want\
    \ to add all the entities back to the same BlockTableRecord the exploded entity\
    \ came from, or if you want to perform some transformations on the exploded entities\
    \ before adding them to the drawing, or if you don't want to add them to the drawing\
    \ at all. \n\nIts up to you to decide which function you want to use in any given\
    \ scenario."

  body: 'Also note that exploding block references with attribute references would
    lose the attribute value.  Using an approach such as this would allow you to do
    extra processing to replace the definisions with DBText or MText.
