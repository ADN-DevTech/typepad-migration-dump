  body: 'Hi,


    The said blog is a workaround to fix the behavior of retrieving Candidate planes
    on Non-Solid custom entities, but for custom-solids too we have seen the same
    behavior of not reporting Candidate planes, this behavior is under analysis with
    Engineering, do let me know. You can raise a ticket through ADN portal.'

  body: 'How is this AcDbDynamicUCSPE implemented?

    I have an existing Entity derived from AcDbEntity and I now want to implement
    the dynamic UCS behavior on my custom entities.

    I cannot switch the base class of my existing entities (already in existing drawings).


    So how do I do this/
