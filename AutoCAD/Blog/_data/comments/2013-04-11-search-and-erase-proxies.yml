    But proxy object can be owned not only NOD...

    Maybe more useful will be direct scan Database from Database.BlockTableId.Handle
    to Database.Handseed, check every object and erase if proxy.

    What do you think about that algorithm? I''ve used it more then 10 years with
    ObjectARX.'

    So you are going to the list of object directly...sounds good to. I just like
    the AutoCAD database structure, so I followed it :)


    Thanks for sharing.
