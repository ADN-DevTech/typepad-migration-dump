  body: 'Two questions:


    It looks like AcDbBlockVisibilityParameter contains only entities visible under
    the default lookup parameters. What if the block definition has a combination
    of visibility and lookup parameters?


    and


    This appears to only check the visibility state on the original block definition,
    instead of a specific reference. Does this mean that to look up the state of a
    specific reference, the extension dictionary on "BlockRef.DynamicBlockTableRecord"
    should be used instead?'

  body: "To answer question two, yes the code checks the entities visible inside each\
    \ visibility state of the block record. For a block reference you would check\
    \ in which visibility state it is through its dynamic parameters and deduce from\
    \ that which entities are visible for that specific reference.\n\nI’m not sure\
    \ about the first question, did you test on an actual drawing? \n\nKeep in mind\
    \ that this approach should be considered as a \"hack\". This information is not\
    \ exposed through any public API, so some data might not be accessible at all\
    \ and if you need to further dig it out, you would need to investigate that on\
    \ your own."

  body: 'Yes, I tested a pre-made dynamic block reference of a "wood screw" that I
    found online. It used a visibility parameter to select the screw type, and a lookup
    parameter to select the screw length.


    What I didn''t know at the time was that the lookup table was controlling a stretch
    action and an array action. Therefore I doubt it''s possible to get find the entities
    of a dynamic block reference in their current state using this approach.


    I''m going to set the block to "explodable" and try using acedCmd() to run the
    Explode command and see if that works for me.


    Thanks.'

  body: I know a little late but if wanting to know what is visible for a BlockReference
    iterate its Blocktablerecord and check each entities IsVisible property.

    can you tell me the Entry Point for AutoCAD 2017 and 2018?


    Thanks for your answer.


    BTW: How it goes?
