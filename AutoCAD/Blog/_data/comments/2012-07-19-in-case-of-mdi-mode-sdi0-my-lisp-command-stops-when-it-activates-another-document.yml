    How would one do this?  Here is my issue: 1) I am trying to copybase objects in
    the modelspace of my current drawing (a.dwg) which I can do with a lisp; 2) The
    trouble I am having is getting the lisp to open a template file (dwt), paste 0,0,0
    the objects from a.dwg, and saveas b.dwg to the folder directory of a.dwg.  The
    cause of the issue is SDI=0.  The only way I can get the lisp to do what I want
    is by setting SDI=1.
