  body: 'Hi There,


    Well, in .Net custom entities do not exist but you could achieve the same result
    by using "DrawableOverrule.ViewportDraw" method.


    I don''t have a sample ready to send you unfortunately. You should be able to
    find overrule sample on this blog or on Kean''s Through The Interface blog.


    I hope it helps.
