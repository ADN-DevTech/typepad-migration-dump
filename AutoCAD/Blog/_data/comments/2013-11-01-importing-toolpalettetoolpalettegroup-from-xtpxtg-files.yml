  body: 'Hi Francine,


    If you want to do this using the AutoCAD UI, it can be done as follows :


    1. Right click in the empty area of the tool palette window and select "customize
    palettes"


    2. In the window that appears, select a tool palette and right click on it to
    export/import to or from an xtp file.

  body: 'Hi Chockalingam,


    I do not think Autoloader supports loading XTP files. I will need to verify that
    with my colleagues. It would be easier to deploy your tool palettes using the
    Autoloader, if you create .atc files for your tool palettes and place them in
    your bundle folder. The folder path can be specified using the "ToolPalettePath"
    attribute in the "RuntimeRequirements" and AutoCAD will load the tool palettes
    automatically. But please note that the grouping of the tool palettes is not possible  as
    that would require importing XPG files. Autoloader does not have support for that
    at present.

    How about loading the XTP file using the "StartupCommand" ? You can then import
    an XPG too.
