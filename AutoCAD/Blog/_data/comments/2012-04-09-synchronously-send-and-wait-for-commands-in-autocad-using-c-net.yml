  body: "Thanks Fenton!\nBut why 'CharSet = CharSet.Ansi' ? It is true for AutoCAD\
    \ 2006 but 'CharSet = CharSet.Unicode' for AutoCAD 2007... \nAlso \"acad.exe\"\
    \ is for AutoCAD 2006...2012 but \"accore.dll\" for AutoCAD 2013."

  body: "You're right, that's a bug for sure, sorry about that. \n\nThat said, I don't\
    \ think it causes a problem because the parameters are passed via an IntPtr linked\
    \ list, not strings, so the Marshaler doesn't affect them. \n\nBecause we aren't\
    \ specifically passing strings through the parameter list, probably best to omit\
    \ that setting altogether... \n\ne.g.\n\n[DllImport(\"acad.exe\", EntryPoint =\

  body: how is the "Fiber removal project" going? this is the first time I found evidence
    that you are working on it, since Kean's post in 2011 :)

  body: "Hello Fenton,\n\nKindly, I tried the code but with replacing the \"INSERT\"\
    \ command with the following:\nrb.Add(New TypedValue(5005, \"_.AECTOACAD\" & vbLf\
    \ & \"bind\" & vbLf & \"No\" & vbLf & \"\" & vbLf & AecToAcadFileName & vbLf))\n\
    \nThe problem is: cmdNames is always resturning only the \"TEST7\" command name\
    \ & not AECtoACAD. \n\nPlease advise. Thanks"

  body: 'Hi Mono


    you don''t add vbLf to a typedvalue string, you create new typed values... e.g


    rb.Add(New TypedValue(5005, "_.AECTOACAD");

    rb.Add(New TypedValue(5005, "_bind");

    rb.Add(New TypedValue(5005, "_no");

    rb.Add(New TypedValue(5005, AecToAcadFileName);

    acedCmd(rb.UnmanagedObject);'

  body: 'Fenton,

    I have set up a pedit method like the above example.If I call "Test7" from the
    command line it works but if I call the method from code it goes through the motions
    but never sends the commands to the command line.I can use SendStringToExecute("test7
    ",true,false,false) and that works but then its asynchronous.Any Ideas?'

  body: 'I realize that this post is old but it is still relevant today.

    How is this to be implemented on newer software such as AutoCAD 2020 or newer.

    On these packages I do no think that it works any longer as the entry points are
    not the same.
