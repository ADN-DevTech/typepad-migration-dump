    I have had ScriptPro2.0 since It was released.

    It looks like this build is different ....

    it uses a different menu and form design and can use accoreconsole.exe and ACAD2013.


    Why is it still called version 2.0 when it is obviously different.


    Regards

    Kerry'

    \ from the original version released in November 2010. But the core logic is still\
    \ the same as the original version. The new version contains few bug fixes and\
    \ new features like wizard. but the same time we have changed the assembly versions\
    \ 2.0.3.0.\n  \nregards\nViru"

    Perhaps one way to let people know the current version would be to add the assembly
    version to the site. Otherwise people will either miss the update or download
    each month just to see if it is new :)


    ... Or post a notice here will suit those of us who visit here.


    Regards

    Kerry.'

    I ran into a problem though: I was making a "purge" script for a batch of drawing,
    but I wasn''t able to disable the prompt "Thich block contains dynamic Features.
    Would you like to open it in the block editor?" when opening a drawing. Thus,
    resulting in failing my script to run.

    Is there any option to disable that prompt?'

    I used your purge scr as it first and it failed. I change the scr a little by

  body: BTW, do not use scripts to clean excess reg apps (application IDs). It is
    a waste of time as the xrefs load when the file opens and your purges either lock
    or take 20-30 seconds if you really have an app id problem. So many people put
    -purge R in their startup, but they have yet to experience current drawing and
    2 xrefs with 50k+ app ids. That stops everything. Not that app ids are corruption,
    but they bulk the file and prevent Audit from running (well, finishing) if you
    need to. Instead use the Autodesk regapp cleaner or my batcher posted in .net
    forums, or JTB purger - anything but a tool like full acad or coreconsole.

    Contained an extra "space" at the last line of the script, which acts as an "enter",

    So lesson is....make sure last line in script is the same as the last input you
