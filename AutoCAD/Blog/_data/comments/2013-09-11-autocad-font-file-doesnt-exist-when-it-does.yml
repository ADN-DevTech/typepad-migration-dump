  body: 'We have a simple lisp routine which creates a few text styles in AutoCAD
    2014 (windows 7)  A few people have the same issue while others don''t. The lisp
    route errors out because the file does not exist, however, they can create the
    style via the dialog... Others are not having the issue. What''s really going
    on?  I''ve seen other posts regarding this issue but all responses are workarounds.  We''ve
    updated the Arial.ttf font with no results.  The dialog works while the command
    line doesn''t.
