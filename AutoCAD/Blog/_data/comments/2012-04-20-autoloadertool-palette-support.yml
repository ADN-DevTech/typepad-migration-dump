  body: 'Hello Stephen


    An interesting article. Greatly appreciated. However it returns some question
    marks, some answers and information for other readers...


    After following your instructions I managed to get it working for blocks. I tested
    a library with 185 Dutch traffic signs and dragged them from explorer to a new
    palette, copied the files, closed the palette, et cetera as you described.


    So I thought it would be smart to create a spreadsheet that constructs the xml
    needed for a new palette. Does not work and I haven''t the faintest idea why:
    name_uuid.atc with bit-wise exact same syntax fails. Uuids generated with $ for
    i in {1..400}; do uuidgen -r; done (with Linux or Cygwin). Noticed that uuid in
    file name equals xml entry ItemID of Palette. Searched with regedit for both name
    and uuid in name_uuid.atc – without result. Can you clarify? Palette shows up
    in AutoCAD but dragging a button gives: "Unable to execute tool. Possible causes
    are: The tool is not registered properly. Check your installation. The tool is
    from another application and is incompatible with the current application." It
    drove me nuts. Where is it registered? It would really be helpful to be able to
    generate large palettes outside AutoCAD and simply dump them in the name.bundle\contents
    folder.


    One thing I noticed is that a palette file assumes there is a folder "Images"
    under the palette holding folder. So copying the .atc files isn''t enough, I copied
    the images too, not sure if they are needed in an app distribution. Are they?
    Off topic: What a pity svg''s are not supported.


    Another obstacle is about file names. The generated xml / atc file contains absolute
    paths – like C:\ProgramData\Autodesk\ApplicationPlugins\a.bundle\contents\lib\trafficsigns\_colors.dwg.
    Needless to say this is a problem when distributing an app into the wild, in this
    case the app lives under %programdata% but it could also be under %appdata%. PackageContents.xml
    contains a valid entry ToolPalettePath="./contents/". Apparently it is possible
    to cut of the prefix "C:\ProgramData\Autodesk\ApplicationPlugins\a.bundle\contents\"
    for all entries in the .atc file – leaving "lib\trafficsigns\blockname.dwg" –
    and keep a functional palette. So my conclusion is that locations relative to
    the app''s ToolPalettePath will be valid – very handy and I hope my conclusion
    is right.


    Best regards, Wiebe van der Worp'

  body: 'Long time have I Googled for the solution for distributing custom made Tool
    Palettes and changing ToolPalettePath. I have only found LISP-solutions until
    I found this. This was a very simple way to do it. I load a .bundle-file that
    points to a Tool Palette located on our server. Then I´m able to update the ToolPalette
    and my collegues gets the latest one on every AutoCAD startup. All links are relative.
    Many thanks!
