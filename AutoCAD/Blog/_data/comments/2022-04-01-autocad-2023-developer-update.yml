  body: 'Madhukar Moogala, Hi


    I''ve been using Visual Studio 2022 for developing .NET addins using AutoCAD 2023.


    I''m wondering about the availability of the AutoCAD 2023 API Help import for
    VS2022 . . I see that it''s currently only available for VS2019.


    I imagine there will be quite a few people looking for the VS2022 .Net Wizard
    also :)


    Regards,

  body: "Hello Kerry,\n\nI did some initial testing with the Integrated ObjectARX\
    \ 2023 Help installer for VS2019 and it should work with VS2022 as well.  The\
    \ only thing that I noticed at the moment is that you will need to update your\
    \ VS2022 installer to include the Help Viewer which can be found on the Individual\
    \ Components tab.  Once installed, you should be able to run the Integrated ObjectARX\
    \ 2023 Help installer as it is only looking for the installed location of MS Help\
    \ Viewer 2.3 in order to merge the help files into the correct Content Store.\n\
    \nLet me know if this works for you or not.  Further testing will need to be done\
    \ before making any official release of the installer.\n\nSincerely,\n  Lee"

  body: You will need to update your VS2022 installation to include the Help Viewer,
    which is located on the Individual Components menu, as that is the only problem
    I have seen so far. Once MS Help Viewer 2.3 is installed, you should be able to
    execute the Integrated ObjectARX 2023 Help installer because it just needs to
    find that directory in order to merge the help files into the appropriate Content
    Store.
