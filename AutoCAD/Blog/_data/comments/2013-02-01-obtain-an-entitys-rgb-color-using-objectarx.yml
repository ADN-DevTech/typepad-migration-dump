  body: "Hi, I have a question here. \nWhen I change the background color from black\
    \ to other colour, the RGB values change. For example, ACI 134 is (0,153,153)\
    \ when the backgroud is black, but its RGB value become (0,127,127) when I change\
    \ the background colour to blue. The code above always return RGB as (0, 153,\
    \ 153). So how to get the actual RGB whatever the background colour?\nThanks in\
    \ advance.\n-----"
