    thanks for your post.


    Is it possible to retrieve/copy for example solid entities from an attached NWC
    coordination model in AutoCAD?


    Best

    Hi Sebastian,

    &nbsp;

    I&#8217;m sorry for delay, didn&#8217;t notice your comment.

    NWC is just an underlay in AutoCAD unlike xref, reading the underlay database
    and extracting the solids is not possible at present.
