  body: 'Hi Viru,


    If I have implemented multiple context menus, but am having a problem with only
    two.


    Specifically, one for BlockReference, and one for Table. How to I prevent them
    both from being displayed when a Table is selected?


    Example:

    <i>

    RXClass blockRx = BlockReference.GetClass(typeof(BlockReference));

    acApp.AddObjectContextMenuExtension(blockRx , blockMenu);


    RXClass tableRx = Table.GetClass(typeof(Table));

    acApp.AddObjectContextMenuExtension(tableRx , tableMenu);

    </i>


    My implementation works well for all other Types, having to only call AddObjectContextMenuExtension()
    once, but the two I mention are the only ones that show both context menus as
    described above.


    I''m trying to avoid having to repeated calls to AddObjectContextMenuExtension(),
    and RemoveObjectContextMenuExtension() to prevent this undesired behavior.


    Thanks'

  body: After some testing, I learned that the issue was due to Table deriving from
    BlockReference. Instead of having two separate context menus (one for each) I
    only need one context menu for both (specifically for BlockReference), and a logical
    test of a non-Null cast 'as Table' within the Popup Event to Remove()/Add() the
    appropriate MenuItems.
