  body: 'I am struggling here with VB.NET and Plant3D.  I have downloaded the Plant
    SDK for 2015Here is what I want to do: Access the Drawing Properties, such as
    AREA, and make changes to those properties.  For example, change a blank entry
    for AREA to Area51.  I am a bit lost now on what References I should load, what
    namespace I should Import.  And then how to call the right Dim pProp ??? to get
    me going.  Please help if you can.
