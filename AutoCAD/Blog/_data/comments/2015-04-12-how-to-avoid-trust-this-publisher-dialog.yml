    Thanks for the valuable info.


    Is there any way to avoid the pop-up for first time itself?


    Thanks,

  body: Yes, you need to install certificate to store during installation of your
    plugin, this can be achieved by custom action when your prepare your MSI.

  body: Hi Madhukar, I want to use AcSignTool command line tool to sign my lisp files
    but there doesn't seem to be any documentation available to understand the tool
    behavior especially how I can supply a certificate to the AcSignTool to sign my
    files, can you please throw some light.

  body: 'Hi Madhukar,

    I have added a call to certutil in our installer to register our code signing
    certificate (.cer file). This works fine, but produces a command window flashing
    by at install time. To avoid this I am trying to implement the C++ code as custom
    action. I am having trouble with it - the CryptQueryObject() fails since the .cer
    file isnt in PKCS7, and not binary either (it''s BASE64).

    Changing the parameters to the function to CERT_QUERY_CONTENT_FLAG_ALL and CERT_QUERY_FORMAT_FLAG_ALL
    makes the call pass, but mhMsg is NULL so the rest fails.

    Do you have any advice on how to get this to work?'

    a file signed with the certificate to install, i.e. an EXE or DLL file. Then the
    code works.
