  body: 'Hi Virupaksha,


    I would like to frequently update my assembly DLL files in the package after asking
    Autodesk to publish as an MSI file. Everytime I do update DLL files, do I need
    to ask ADN team for help to create a new MSI package? I don''t know how Autodesk
    supports this as it will bother the ADN team a lot.


    Thanks,

    Khoa

    \ rename their App without ADN assistance?\n\nCurrently, when one selects the\
    \ Edit link, the app name is selectable immediately when the app's contents are\
    \ being loaded, but that text box is subsequently disabled (i.e., Developer cannot\
    \ change app name). \n\nThis is preferable to creating a new App, and deleting\
    \ one that may already be in progress, or having to burden ADN to do this for\
    \ us.\n\nCheers"

    will have modifications as the assembly is being updated frequently to add more
