  body: 'Not working for me neither, with no previous install of ObjectARX documentation
    2012. Step 3 done + Visual Studio 2010 Help Library Manager set to local as explained.


    Can see the Autodesk, Inc directory created in

    C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\HelpLibrary\content\


    But it has no effect on Visual Studio Help. F1 on "DocumentManager" class leads
    to a 404 error of internet explorer with "the topic you requested could not be
    found in local help." error message.'

    Lee is working on an update to the installer, which I hope will be available soon.'

    The local help for it is working I can access for exemple to the "EventArgs" class
    documentation. But nothing about Autodesk.Autocad classes like "ViewTableRecord".


    When I open "C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\HelpLibrary\content" I can see the Microsoft
    folder containing all .mshc .mshi and .metadata for Visual Studio, I can also
    see the Autodesk, Inc folder containing the same kind of contents (AdskManaged.1  .mshc
    .mshi and .metadata). But it seems that this part is not referenced by the Visual
    Studio Help.
