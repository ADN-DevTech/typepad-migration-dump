  body: Thanks for that. This makes ressources more widely available, and to help
    target only Autodesk programming ressources, you can use the Google CSE engine
    on top of <a href="http://www.acadnetwork.com">http://www.acadnetwork.com</a>
    with its languages and sources filtering capabilities.

  body: You mean a blog dedicated to ObjectARX? No plans at the moment. This blog
    includes ObjectARX, but as a lot of our work is driven by questions from ADN members,
    the mix in the blog reflects the mix in the questions we receive - which means
    more .NET content than others.

  body: 'Thanks for your answer,

    yes, I meant an ObjectARX/DBX oriented blog helping us keeping up-to-date with
    new api features, some more "off the beaten track" investigation and so on as
    Kean does on his blog.'

  body: 'Hi Loic. I''m sure more of those will come in due course. Right now a lot
    of the team''s blogging time is still being spend transferring DevNotes. Although
    a lot of our ''off the beaten path'' work is in the cloud and mobile area (as
    you''d expect :-).
