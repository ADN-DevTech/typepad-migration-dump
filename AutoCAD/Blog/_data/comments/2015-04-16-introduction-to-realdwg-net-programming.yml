  body: Where on earth does one get "Microsoft_VC110_MFC_x64.msm" and "Microsoft_VC110_MFCLOC_x64.msm"
    if they even the right ones for RealDwg 2016? I have to say the process of building
    an installer for RealDwg is the most half-baked, infuriating process I have ever
    paid (a lot) for.

  body: 'Solved. So I just did what anyone would do, fired up a Windows 7 x64 VM I
    had lying around, installed a Visual Studio 2012 Ultimate I had lying around and
    waited for the files to appear in the right place. You all have these things conveniently
    lying around, right? Or you are working with a version of Visual Studio that is
    3 generations behind, right?


    Don''t forget to tick the box for "Visual C++ MFC class libraries" in the installation
    options or the MFC dlls won'' appear.'

  body: This sample is not out of date for RealDwg 2017. More significantly, there
    is nothing even remotely as useful as this included with RealDwg. Why not?

  body: 'Hi Balaji,


    I downloaded sample application(SsmpleCode_DevTV).

    I complied and made an Wix installer for this sample code. But after installing
    this on my test fresh win7 computer with .netframework 4.5, it crashed and won’t
    work. though it works on my development computer.


    I need your support to make it work.

  body: What is a purpose of assigning new database to HostApplicationServices::WorkingDatabase?
    I tried to skip that and code seems to still work. And if it is required then
    how multiple databases are supposed to be handled in parallel?
