  body: 'Hi Mike,


    Yes, this is also exposed using AutoCAD .Net API using the "DocumentWindowCollection.AddDocumentWindow"
    method.


    Kean''s blog demonstrates it usage by loading an uri.

    The other variant of the "AddDocumentWindow" can accept a "DocumentWindow". A
    "WPFDocumentWindow" can be created and used as a document window.
