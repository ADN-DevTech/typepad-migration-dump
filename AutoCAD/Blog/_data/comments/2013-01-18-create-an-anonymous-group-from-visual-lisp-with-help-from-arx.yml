  body: "Hi , During converting some old Lisp code to .Net , I faced a situation.\
    \ After analysing the Lisp code we understand its calling some ARX functions (not\
    \ commands , originally ads function - the whole ObjectARX project does not have\
    \ a single executable commands but all are functions called by AutoLisp ).\nFor\
    \ example as below,\n\nint ReturnListToAutoLisp(void)\n{  \n   struct resbuf *LIST;\
    \ \n\n   //...\n   //...  = acedGetArgs\n   //...\n      \n   acedRetList(LIST);\n\
    \   return RTNORM;\n}\n\nThe function itself does not return the list but the\
    \ list is returned by the acedRetList.\nNow the below AutoLisp code that calls\
    \ this functions and store the return value in a list.\n(setq returnedList (ReturnListToAutoLisp\
    \  5))\nThrough it looks that the ReturnListToAutoLisp  takes an integer ( like\
    \ 5 here ) but actually in the ObjectARX code its parameter list is void ) . However\
    \ the parameter value passed are collected by calling acedGetArgs.\nAlso the return\
    \ value is not a single integer but a list of strings which are collected in the\
    \ AutoLisp variable named ‘returnedList’ and which is used to populated DropDown\
    \ list in DCL UI.\nSo far its okey.\nI have ported the old ObjectARX 2005 code\
    \ to ObjectARX 2014 version and its working fine when called from AutoLisp.\n\
    But while converting the Lisp code to VB.Net , I can’t find a way to collect the\
    \ return value in a .Net variable of type string List (List(Of String)).\n\nI\
    \ found samples to call ObjectARX functions from .Net using P/Invoke which focus\
    \ on passing arguments by creating a ResultBuffer. But I did not find a single\
    \ sample that demonstrate how to collect the list of values retuned from ObjectARX\
    \ functions through acedRetList.\n\nI am counting that there must be a way but\
    \ can’t figure it out. \n\nPlease help.\n\n\n\n\n-----"
