  body: 'If you change to OdbcConnection, and try to run on Civil3D, you get:

    "System.Data.ODBC is not supported on this platform."


    The "C:\Program Files\Autodesk\AutoCAD 2025\C3D\System.Data.Odbc.dll"


    The reason for the problem is that the file that is installed is incorrect.


    need the file:

    "C:\Users\user3\.nuget\packages\system.data.odbc\8.0.0\runtimes\win\lib\net8.0\System.Data.Odbc.dll"


    and not the file:

    "C:\Users\user3\.nuget\packages\system.data.odbc\8.0.0\lib\net8.0\System.Data.Odbc.dll"'
