    What I want to do is the reverse in a way.

    I have the PnPID of a pump in a P&ID drawing.

    I show a list of possible values for the pump, allowing engineers to edit the
    data externally in an Access database.


    What I''d like to do is, to select the datarow and then to navigate to the P&ID
    and zoom into that pump.


    Is this possible?'
