    Like to remind what not only commands, but their options also should be "internationalized".
    That is not "Yes" but "_Yes" and not "block" but "_block".'

    of AutoCAD? :-)

    Maybe someone can help me solve my problem.

    I wonder why this code does not work when working with AutoCAD 2013:


    Imports Autodesk.AutoCAD.Runtime

    Imports Autodesk.AutoCAD.Interop

    Imports Autodesk.AutoCAD.Interop.Common


    Public Class Class1


    Public ReadOnly Property ThisDrawing() As AcadDocument

    Get

    Return Autodesk.AutoCAD.ApplicationServices.Application. _

    DocumentManager.MdiActiveDocument.acaddocument

    End Get

    End Property


    <CommandMethod("COMANDO")> Public Sub COMANDO()


    Thisdrawing.Utility.Prompt("Hola mundo")


    End Sub

    End Class


    I wonder if the way we work with INTEROP, and INTEROP.COMMON, has changed in AutoCAD
    2013, and if so, what would be the new way of working with these references?.'
