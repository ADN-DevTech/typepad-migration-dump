  body: but this doesn't exist in RealDwg because there is no implementation of ApplicationServices
    but the docs don't mention that (they do mention this functionality, just as a
    tease) so if you paid for RealDwg just forget you ever saw this ok?

  body: Well... interesting, having just moved to AutoCAD 2017, this explains why
    'our' third party's objects get reduced to Proxy objects when RECOVER is used.
    Although, we were previously on 2016... I think RECOVER worked then. Why does
    it not work now?
