  body: "This works, except when i copy the button to another menu.\n\nSo i create\
    \ a custom menu and dll. I then load that menu as a partial menu (all works).\n\
    I then create a toolbar/panel and copy one of the button in my custom menu file\
    \ to my new toolbar/panel .  the button works fine, but the image is lost. \n\n\
    Any ideal why the new toolar\\panel can't see the image once it copied out sides\
    \ it menu?\n\nPS. this same thing work fine wth Acad menu ideals.. \n-----"
