  body: 'Hi David,


    Might be possible if you override the GetGripPoints function and then call the
    base class'' function first then remove the point added by the dynamic block.

    The question might be how to identify the insertion point.

    I think you should be able to get that information from the dynamic block then
    iterate through the points and compare their value to the point you want to remove.


    I hope this helps.


    Cheers,

    Adam'

    Thanks for getting back to me.

    I don''t even know how to start that. A little bit more help/sample code would
    be a great help, if you don''t mind.

    I really need to hide the insertion point(Grip) of dynamic  blocks because it
    interferes with  other dynamic block grips.

    Regards,

    David.'

    I use Grippointoverrule for adding custom Grips to my blockrefs (filtered by name
    prefix). It works fine, the only thing I experienced is, that attributreferences
    will not be dragged and moved by MoveGripPointsAt. Am I missing something?

    Thanks in advance,

    Daniel'

    Sorry for the delay.


    I tried using a grip overrule on a block reference that had attribute references
    in it. Unfortunately I could not reproduce the behavior that you mentioned. When
    moving using the overruled grip, the attribute references moved along with the
    block reference. Here is the code that I used :

    Can you please share a non-confidential code sample for me to reproduce the  behavior
    ?


    Thanks.

    thanks for the reply. I will compare your code with mine to see if I''m wrong
    somewhere. I''ll try to share some content of mine, but that will be a bit tricky
    because of the surrounding it works in :-)


    BR,
