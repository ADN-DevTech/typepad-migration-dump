  body: 'This is my comments:


    DCF is SQLite database. If we open ProcessPower.dcf file, the table stores all
    those drawings is PnPDrawings, and the view is PnPDrawings_PNP.


    Since AutoCAD P&ID 2009, it already had table PnPDrawings, but it stores dummy
    data. The project drawing files are on PnIDPart.xml. But from P&ID 2013, this
    table has actual real drawing references, and strips all those project drawing
    files out of PnIDPart.xml. The benefit of database over XML is for multi-user
    connections.


    The API will call SQLite library to query data, so if we can use SQLite instead
    of AutoCAD P&ID API, it would be really more powerful.'

  body: Product can be configured to use SQL Server also. Using the APIs allow your
    customization to be database and schema agnostic.

  body: 'That is correct, the API will sync between drawing schema and database. But
    by learning what behind P&ID project, the actual mapping between database (SQLite
    or SQL server) and Project/Data Manager in Plant3d is helpful to understand how
    it works. Working directly with database instead of API is better for SQL Reporting
    Services.
