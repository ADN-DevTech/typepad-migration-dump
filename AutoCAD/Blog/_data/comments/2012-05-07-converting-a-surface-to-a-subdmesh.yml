  body: 'Hi Balaji,

    I was trying to test the above code (with some changes) and got an error "eInvalidInput"
    on creating some surfaces. tried to debug and found out that AutoCAD can not create
    Surface object from some Face objects in some circumstances!


    for instance, following code could not be run on my machine (Windows 7 x64, AutoCAD
    2012 - English) but every other faces are being generated without any problem,
    I don''t understand what''s wrong with this particular face!

    Any idea/suggestion?



    face = new Face(new Autodesk.AutoCAD.Geometry.Point3d(249111.163422751, 15107.1921285706,
    567684.207116981), new Autodesk.AutoCAD.Geometry.Point3d(249073.772313812, 15111.1612905044,
    567682.875008800), new Autodesk.AutoCAD.Geometry.Point3d(249110.672949469, 15113.8711037982,
    567682.875008800), true, true, true, true);


    surface = new Autodesk.AutoCAD.DatabaseServices.Surface();


    surface = Autodesk.AutoCAD.DatabaseServices.Surface.CreateFrom(face);'

  body: "Hi Afshin,\n\nSorry for the delay in replying to your comment.\n\nI have\
    \ seen such issues when using large coordinates. One possible workaround is to\
    \ move the face closer to the origin and then mesh it. After the meshing, you\
    \ can move it back to its original position.\n\nPlease try this :\n\n        \
    \    Point3d p1 = new Point3d(249111.163422751, 15107.1921285706, 567684.207116981);\n\
    \            Point3d p2 = new Point3d(249073.772313812, 15111.1612905044, 567682.875008800);\n\
    \            Point3d p3 = new Point3d(249110.672949469, 15113.8711037982, 567682.875008800);\n\
    \            Autodesk.AutoCAD.DatabaseServices.Face face = new Autodesk.AutoCAD.DatabaseServices.Face(p1,\
    \ p2, p3, true, true, true, true);\n            face.TransformBy(Matrix3d.Displacement(p1\

    \ a mesh to 3dsolid, reading vertexes, faces and creating face/surface object\
    \ then creating solid by passing surface[]. am I on the right track?!"

    I experience memory not being freed up in the above routine(having the second
    using block commented out)

    in Autocad 2016-17. I have posted the issue in the forum here too. Could consider
    looking at it? thanks.Ali

    Autodesk.AutoCAD.DatabaseServices.Surface surface = new Autodesk.AutoCAD.DatabaseServices.Surface();


    didn''t help. It sounds like a memory leak in Autocad to me, is that right?
