  body: the point monitor worked great for me in ACAD2014 however now we are using
    ACAD2016 it will not work because of the DLLImport of acdb19.dll. Is there a way
    to make it load eighter version since we now have both versions of AutoCAD in
    house?

  body: 'There is a little bug in ''FindAtPoint''.

    Instead of:

    string arg = selectAll ? ":E" : string.Empty;

    It must be:

    string arg = selectAll ? "_:E" : string.Empty;

    Otherwise ''SelectAll'' does not work!
