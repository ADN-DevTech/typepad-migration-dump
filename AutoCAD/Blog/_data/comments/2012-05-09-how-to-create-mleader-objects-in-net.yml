  body: 'I''m not sure what you mean, there is no such thing as built-in blocks like
    box or circle, those are entities that can be inserted inside a block. So if the
    block already exist, you have to use its ObjectId that can be found if you know
    the block name, this is pretty much what is exposed in that sample. Otherwise
    you may have to create the block on the fly and insert whatever entities you want
    inside it. We have multiple samples on that blog that should help you create a
    block.
