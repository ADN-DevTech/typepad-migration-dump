  body: 'I''m getting this too. On x86 it works fine. But for x64 it crashes 2011

    I really hope there is a simple workaround.'

  body: 'From a .NET novice...

    Reading the code above, I am struggling to see how the TaskDialog gets closed
    when the processing has ended. Would someone please explain how this is achieved
    programmatically. Whenever I have seen or used a TaskDialog , it is always displayed
    until the user clicks a button.

    I am coming from Visual Lisp & not quite upto speed with .NET.

    Inside the handleCallback function you can see that when the callbackData.Counter
    reaches 100 then the Cancel button is clicked using the ClickButton function.


    Cheers,

  body: 'Hello,


    I do not think it is possible to increment the progress bar position from inside
    a for loop.


    The computations that are in a for loop will require to be moved to the callback
    attached to the TaskDialog.


    When the TaskDialog.Show is called, it is left to the callback to determine when
    the task is done and to click on the cancel button to close it.
