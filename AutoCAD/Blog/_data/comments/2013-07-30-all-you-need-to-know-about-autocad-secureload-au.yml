    \ for a few weeks now.  I have over 100 users and some are on 2012, 2013 and 2014.\
    \ So getting to the bottom has been a nightmare.  \nI am just unsure why this\
    \ acad.fas keeps coming back after I deleted it on most of the machines.  \nI\
    \ will put some of my new knowledge to work and maybe beat this beast.\nCheers,"

  body: 'While I am very pleased that Autodesk has implemented some form of AutoCAD
    Security, the current mechanism unfortunately suffers multiple pit-falls....


    One of which, is that Autodesk has neglected to address the initial, systemic
    problem, and has only implemented a ''band-aid'' to address the symptoms... Changing
    the order of operation for the FindFile() Method, so that the Support File Search
    Path (SFSP) is searched first, and if none are found only then search current
    folder, etc. would allow those who use Acad.[lsp[fas[vlx]]], etc. to be safe,
    and those who do not would remain just as exposed as they are today.


    I''ve brought this to Autodesk staff''s attention multiple times, and even received
    feedback that this should be done, yet it remains unchanged (for some unknown,
    presumably good reason?). Further, AutoCAD Security seems to utterly neglect Acad.mnl,
    etc.


    Another is the advent of Autoloader, which is pretty good at doing what it was
    designed to do (it too has some shortcomings), but doesn''t seem to have been
    designed with Security in mind at all.


    Basically, malicious code can now easily create a .bundle in any of the implicitly
    trusted locations (depending on user permissions), as Autoloader doesn''t bother
    to even check if a given .bundle is Hidden, etc... If a user isn''t adept at the
    complexities of Autolaoder, they might not even notice a malicious .bundle unless
    it were to cause undesired behavior, frankly.


    As discussed with Dieter previously on the topic of Security:


    "Coming from the Military myself, the security gamble isn''t about preventing
    exploitation of all possible vulnerabilities... It’s about securing your weakest
    points in critical order for mission accomplishment, controlling the flow of information,
    early warning system redundancy, and something that even the lowest ranking Soldier
    knows... Overlapping fields of fire." - BlackBox

  body: Thank you for this great article. I do not see AUTOLOADPATH documented in
    the 2012 SP1 ReadMe like it was with 2013 SP1.  Was this such a new feature in
    2012 that it was available, but just did not make it to press?
