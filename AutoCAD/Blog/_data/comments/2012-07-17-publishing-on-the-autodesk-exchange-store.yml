  body: 'Hi Stephen,


    It would be really useful if you (or someone over at the ADN) could post a (clearly
    annotated) sample Autoloader file for people to follow; I''ve managed to get it
    working for my needs, thanks in no small part to posts by Kean <a href="https://encrypted.google.com/search?q=autoloader&btnG=%C2%BB&domains=through-the-interface.typepad.com&sitesearch=through-the-interface.typepad.com&sei=u0Y_UOLtAejc2QWax4DoDA&gbv=2">here</a>,
    and if Autodesk are wanting more people to post their applications to the Exchange
    store, making it as easy as possible to do so (with easy to follow/copy example
    files) seems like the best way forward I think you''ll agree.


    Thanks,


    Alex.'

  body: 'Hi Stephen,

    I think Autodesk may be missing a large issue here, which is that companies generally
    do not want users installing their own tools. The more organized ones want users
    to tell some cad manager about a tool, then he would say "yep, and all users here
    need it." and then download it and put in a central place, or have some util distrib
    it to users. Can you explain how Autodesk sees this happening with the app store?
    This theme of supporting users as opposed to "enterprises" will be a major roadblock
    to just about anything autodesk tries to do. The 360 cloud thing is a perfect
    example. The cloud space should be pooled and only split up into separate user
    accounts if requested. Even Civil 3D suffers from the "how can I share this one
    thing" approach, instead of saying, "how can I share tons of stuff at once to
    lots of people". thanks'

  body: Yes James - Supporting bulk purchasing, network deployments etc. from the
    Exchange store are extremely important. We already know this. But the beauty of
    a website is that you don't have to implement every feature you want to have before
    you launch it.

    It''s a good site for developers and End Users.

    I was wondering if you be willing to support the country''s language.

    Thanks'

  body: Right now, the Exchange store is English only. The app itself can support
    as many languages as you like (as long as that includes English), but the description
    must be in English. Once the store is running smoothly in English, I'm sure we'll
    be adding support for other languages.

  body: 'up to you on timing, just wanted to clarify one thing. If I downloaded an
    app, I would not install it on a bunch of machines. What we do is robocopy the
    program files to each machine, then a command in acad would load whatever and
    run it.

    So I guess I am saying it would be good to be able to download just the files
    needed, and a readme explaining what must be loaded for the prog to work. Others
    may install and treat each app like a little program, I find it a pain though.'

    I think many questions will disappear, if Autodesk will provides the XSD schema
    for the PackageContents.xml file.
