  body: 'On the one hand I am very happy for Fenton - sometimes you need to change
    jobs, but on the other hand it will be very miss without him. For over ten years
    he gave great answers to questions of ADN members. We can say that he is a legend
    for those who create applications for AutoCAD and other Autodesk products.


    And I agree with Stephen that replace Fenton will be very-very hard!'

    Thanks to Fenton for the work he did helping us all struggling around dark side
    of Object ARX or even darker OEM installer!

    me with the recent Autodesk Portathon event.


    Stephen, if you''d like to blog about some of those top secret things Fenton will
    be working on, you can blog them on my site - I will allow it. ;) Good luck in
    tracking down a replacement for Fenton - hopefully it won''t take too long.'
