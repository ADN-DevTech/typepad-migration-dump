  body: 'Hi Tony,


    If I just call MonitorList[dbObj.ObjectId] the code will throw KeyNotFoundException
    exception at the first time.


    So I used Remove to clear any previous data, if any, then Add to add it again.
    That will will store only the last version (before the current edit of the object).


    Simply call Add will also throw an exception if already exist.


    Hope that make sense.

    Sorry, but I think that''s incorrect.


    The indexer ''set'' does not require the key to exist, and it if the key doesn''t
    exist, it adds the key and value, otherwise, it sets the value of the existing
    entry with that key to the supplied value.'

    Sounds like you are right...I just saw the list of exceptions, which led to my
    conclusion, now reading the whole thing it says: "If the specified key is not
    found, a get operation throws a KeyNotFoundException, and a set operation creates
    a new element with the specified key" (<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/9tee9ht2.aspx?cs-save-lang=1&cs-lang=csharp">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/9tee9ht2.aspx?cs-save-lang=1&cs-lang=csharp</a>
    )


    Good point, thanks again.


    What about the whole code/idea, have you tried? Helped you? :)

    My interest stems from this thread:


    <a href="http://www.theswamp.org/index.php?topic=43356.msg485953#msg485953">http://www.theswamp.org/index.php?topic=43356.msg485953#msg485953</a>


    ... Where you''ve offered me an ObjectOverrule sample, that I simply must not
    understand how to implement for my purposes:


    <a href="http://www.theswamp.org/index.php?topic=43356.msg486228#msg486228">http://www.theswamp.org/index.php?topic=43356.msg486228#msg486228</a>


    I was hoping Augusto''s example would offer some means by which to fill the gap
    between Database.ObjectModified, and EnteringQuiescentState (i.e., immediately
    following Properties Pane change(s) given an entity selection)... As obviously
    there''s no CommandEnded event raised in this scenario.'

    This post applies to AutoCAD, not to Revit.


    For Revit, there is an event called DocumentChanged that is similar: <a href="http://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/revit-products/downloads/caas/CloudHelp/cloudhelp/2015/ENU/Revit-API/files/GUID-288EF636-4EBF-4B5D-8E3F-246C810C2720-htm.html">http://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/revit-products/downloads/caas/CloudHelp/cloudhelp/2015/ENU/Revit-API/files/GUID-288EF636-4EBF-4B5D-8E3F-246C810C2720-htm.html</a>
