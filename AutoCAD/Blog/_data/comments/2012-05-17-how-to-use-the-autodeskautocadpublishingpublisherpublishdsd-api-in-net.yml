  body: 'Hi  Philippe.

    I apologise for my bad English.


    Sorry, but it ain''t working in AutoCAD 2013 x64 for me.

    I created c:\Temp directory, created two DWG files. In each DWG I created "Setup1"
    in Page Setup Manager dialog. Each drawing has Layout1 with some primitives. I
    have "DWF6 ePlot.pc3".


    In the program runtime I get an error of AutoCAD and the application is closed.


    If I open c:\Temp, then I see the new files: logdwf.txt and publisher.dsd, but
    execution of the program is interrupted.


    Regards'
