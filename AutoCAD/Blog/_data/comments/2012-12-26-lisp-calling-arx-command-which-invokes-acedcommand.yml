  body: 'ADS/ARX and ObjectARX are the same thing.

    ADS was in AutoCAD R10...R12

    ARX was in AutoCAD R13

    ObjectARX was in AutoCAD R14,2000...2014

    ADS and ARX has only functions. ObjectARX is for Object-oriented programming (used
    classes/methods).'

  body: "Hi Sofia!\nYou mix different concepts: <b>ObjectARX</b> is C++ library (native\
    \ C++). If you have using .NET there is <b>AutoCAD .NET API</b> (which mostly\
    \ is \"wrappers\" for ObjectARX classes/methods). \n<b>AutoCAD .NET API</b> is\
    \ for creating internal .NET-plugins (dll-files loaded to AutoCAD with help of\
    \ command _NETLOAD or other methods). If you have to write external application\
    \ (exe-file), which control AutoCAD, you have to use <b>AutoCAD COM/ActiveX API</b>\n\

    ObjectARX is C++ library

    AutoCAD .NET API is mostly .NET "wrappers" for ObjectARX and can be used only
    in .NET-plugins (dll-files) loaded into AutoCAD with _NETLOAD command

    AutoCAD COM/ActiveX API can be used both internal (.NET-plugins) and external
    (exe-files controlling AutoCAD)'

    P.S.: ObjectARX is for C++ only, but AutoCAD .NET API is "wrapper" for ObjectARX
    and can be used with VB.NET/C# and other .NET langs.'
