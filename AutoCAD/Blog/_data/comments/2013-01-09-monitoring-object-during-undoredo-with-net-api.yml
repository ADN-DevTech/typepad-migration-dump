    public static void callback_ObjectErased(object sender, ObjectErasedEventArgs
    e)

    {


    bool NoUndo= e.Erased;


    if(NoUndo==true)

    {

    //object erased.

    }

    else

    {

    //UNDO

    }


    }


    And it works.

    ObjectErased event says: Triggered when an object is erased or unerased from a
    database.

  body: 'I have noticed that ObjectErased event works fine when the object is unerased
    (this means that you erased it previously at some point), but if you create a
    polyline, for example and then you do multiple undos, the object dissapears but
    objecterased event is not triggered. This means that I also need to monitoring
    the CommandEnded event for undo command.

    In fact, in the first case I have to check if objecterased event is triggered
    before CommandEnded when I call undo command.

    I hope this to put a bool var within the ObjectErased event to not to execute
    the CommandEnded method then.
