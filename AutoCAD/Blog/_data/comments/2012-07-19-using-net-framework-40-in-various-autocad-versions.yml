  body: 'Hello! Nice article.


    I''m developing an application using Vb.net and Autocad 2011 with Franework 4.
    Everything is fine in my machine.

    But when I try to compile it to be used in another machine that has AutoCad 2010,
    I replace the acmgd.dll and acdbmgd.dll with the 2010 versions, set the framework
    to 3.5 and this error appears: "object reference not set to an instance of an
    object" pointing to a .resx file and I can''t go on.


    Any help, please? I''m stuck here. Thanks'
