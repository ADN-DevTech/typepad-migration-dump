  body: 'Hi Augusto, could you tell me what you mean by "Starting on 2013, AutoCAD
    can run on console mode, which makes easier to restart the process and therefore
    better use release the memory.".  We have an autolisp which is running perfectly
    fine but when we translated in .NET to do the same thing, the memory is growing
    real until we have to restart AutoCAD. We don''t have that problem in the autolisp
    version.

    At the moment, we have to stay with the autolisp version even if it is slower.
    Any help? We are part of ADN'

  body: 'Hi Yvon,


    Until AutoCAD 2012 we had to restart the full acad.exe process, which is quite
    heavy, but now on 2013 we have a faster/lighter version with the console, that
    we can restart quite fast. Have you tried that already?


    Finally, if you have a specific issue, you can post using ADN DevHelp so we can
    investigate it further.

  body: 'Hi Yvon,


    Not sure if this was replied...but anyway, this is not C# related. Actually you
    can create a .bat file to open AutoCAD 2013 console and execute .src files. This
    .src can contain any custom or built-in command.


    Below is a sample for the .bat file to process files on a folder


    >>>

    for %%f IN (c:\SampleDrawings\*.dwg) DO accoreconsole.exe /i "%%f" /s "C:\SampleDrawings\SampleScript.scr"
    /l en-US

    <<<


    It starts one AutoCAD console for each drawing on the folder.

    order to fully restore the memory. That''s why the AutoCAD Console is the main
    alternative here.
