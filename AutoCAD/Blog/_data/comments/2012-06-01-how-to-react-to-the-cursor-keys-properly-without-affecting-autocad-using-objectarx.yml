  body: "With AutoCAD 2014 and 2012 the string is without \"\\n\" at the end each\
    \ line. It is a unique concatenated string. Is it a way to have the same as in\
    \ the command line window?\n Gaetano"

  body: "Hi,\nI have this program which filters F-key presses by subclassing the Acad\
    \ window. It worked in A2004 and A2008.\nIn A2012 it works except for the F3 and\
    \ F6 keys.\nDoes Acad treat those keys differently?\n(I tried the recommended\
    \ method above too, with the same results.)\nAlso, when using subclassing, we\
    \ had the option of calling the original WNDPROC several times with different\
    \ parameters.\nHow is it done using acedRegisterFilterWinMsg()? \n\nThanks,\n\n\
