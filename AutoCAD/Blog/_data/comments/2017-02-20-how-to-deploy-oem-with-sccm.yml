  body: 'A couple of questions (2023 version):

    1) How to know when the silent install finished? When the Icon to start is presente
    on the desktop?

    2) To make a silent installation I must provide my OEM Serial number to the customer.
    Could be this a problem? I noted that is not possibile to have this SN form the
    AutoCAD OEM GUI... so it seems non a good practice to give my personal SN to the
    customer...'
