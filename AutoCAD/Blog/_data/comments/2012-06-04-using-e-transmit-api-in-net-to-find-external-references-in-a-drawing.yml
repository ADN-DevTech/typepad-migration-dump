  body: 'Hi,


    You should find under "C:\Program Files\Common Files\Autodesk Shared"


    18.0 should be for AutoCAD 2010. You can find the list here :

    <a href="http://www.cadforum.cz/cadforum_en/products.asp">http://www.cadforum.cz/cadforum_en/products.asp</a>


    But, the above code snippet cannot work in AutoCAD LT as customizing it is not
    supported. Please try it in full version of AutoCAD.


    Regards,

    Balaji'

    \ a look this:\n\nI tried to do samething on my laptop , as below:\n(1)Installed\
    \ a AutoCAD 2010\n(2)Create a new C# project \n(3)Added a reference of \"Transmittal\
    \ 18.0 Type Library“ to the project\n(4)Tried to compile and run the example source\
    \ code\n\nand I met an exception says \"Retrieving COM factory CLSID {2A45DA6A-F580-4F3F-81D3-F263C4F5C44B}\
    \ component failed due to the error: 80040154\"\n\nThe component if we check \"\
    inproc\" is another dll : eTransmit.dll \nlooks like the interop dll used an external\
    \ reference dll, I am now confused.\n\n\n\n-----"
