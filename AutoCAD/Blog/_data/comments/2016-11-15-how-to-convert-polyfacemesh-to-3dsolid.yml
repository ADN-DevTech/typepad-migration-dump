    1) may be a memory leak if you don''t delete pSubDMesh after calling convertToSolid.

    2) the resulting solid is very dependent on the many MeshPrimitives : first I
    tried to convert a simple "polyfacemesh-box" and the resulting solid was very
    different of a box.

    => instead of a AcDbSubDMesh, I prefer create a AcDbSurface and call AcDb3dSolid::createFrom'

    thank you very much for the code it is very nicely explained.


    However, I am facing a problem when I try to convert the subDMesh to 3dSolid.

    I take an eInvalidContext error from the following function and I do not know
    why.

    pSubDMesh->convertToSolid(false, false, pMeshSolid);


    Do you have any idea why?


    Kind regards,

    Evangelos'

    Hi Thanks for your post,

    &nbsp;

    Can you verify working on your MESH interactively?

    &nbsp;

    <a href="https://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/autocad/learn-explore/caas/CloudHelp/cloudhelp/2016/ENU/AutoCAD-Core/files/GUID-45E37A82-3175-4F20-A5F7-316C46DBEBBB-htm.html">https://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/autocad/learn-explore/caas/CloudHelp/cloudhelp/2016/ENU/AutoCAD-Core/files/GUID-45E37A82-3175-4F20-A5F7-316C46DBEBBB-htm.html</a>

    &nbsp;

    Or you can share the drawing, if there are any self-intersecting entities, operator
    may reject.

    In case of a polyface mesh, I would like to convert it to 3dSolid in order to
    use the Brep functionalities.


    Interactively, you are right the object cannot be converted to solid. So, I think
    there is a problem with the drawing itself.


    What I observed until now is that sometimes drawers use the block reference tool
    to create "3D" shapes. However, this makes the geometry reading through ObjectARX
    very hard. I encountered the following problems:

    - When I encounter an AcDbBlockReference entity I cannot find any attributes for
    it.

    - When you explode an AcDbBlockReference entity you end up with pFace meshes.
    Then, you encounter the problem you cannot convert them to solids.


    You can find the drawing in the following link.

    In addition, if you go to Insert-> Insert you will see the block references I
    mentioned.

    I hope what I wrote is not out of topic.


    Thank you very much for your interest!'

    I have checked the drawing, I suspect the problem could be with one face, where
    it has overlapping vertices.

    I highlighted in screenshot.

    But to use Brep, you can convert it to pfacemesh to surface, apply AcBrMesh to
    surface instead of solid.


    Explode the pFacemesh

    CONVTOSURFACE on the faces you got from exploding.

    Union


    Now you will have single Surface entity, you can use AcBr library.'

    I will try to create an automated process in ObjectARX to handle this type of
    objects.

    I think this would be a good enhancement for your robust code!


    I will let you know if I succeeded!'
