<p>In an effort to further improve the experience our users and developers have with the AutoCAD developer documentation, an update to the AutoCAD Developer Center has been made to make it easier for people to locate the various developer documentation that is available to them.&#0160; This action item originated as a result of the Developer Documentation Survey that was completed by 400+ respondents during the month of March. The survey pointed out that certain documentation was unknown to many of our customers and/or it was hard to discover where we placed it, among a few other items that we are working on improving.</p>
<p>The updates are under the Documentation section on the following page:</p>
