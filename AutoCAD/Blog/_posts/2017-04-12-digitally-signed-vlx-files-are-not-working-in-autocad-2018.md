<p>By <a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/autocad/Madhukar-Moogala.html" target="_self">Madhukar Moogala</a></p> <p>This post to make sure that it reaches all our Publisher community, for some reason digitally signed .vlx binaries are not working, i.e., the binaries are loading but execution commands returns an error.</p> <p>We know the importance and impact of this behaviour, we escalated to Engineering, our development found the root cause and if all set it may be shipped in AutoCAD 2018 update 0.2.</p> <p><strong>Edit :</strong> Thanks to Daniel from Autodesk QA team for correction, instead of AutoCAD 2018 update 2 it should have read AutoCAD 2018.0.2 aka Update 0.2</p> <p>To understand better you can view following screencast.</p><iframe height="590" src="https://screencast.autodesk.com/Embed/Timeline/c6416e11-94a0-44af-bd64-06899a702668" frameborder="0" width="640" webkitallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>
