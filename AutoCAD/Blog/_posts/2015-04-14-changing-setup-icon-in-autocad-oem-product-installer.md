<p>Here is a short blog post about a query from a developer on changing the setup icon for their AutoCAD OEM product.</p>
<p>In the OEM MakeWizard, the company name defaults to "Autodesk". If you leave it unchanged for your product, then the OEM InstallerWizard can automatically start using the "Autodesk" icon as its setup icon. This is regardless of the icon path provided in the OEM InstallerWizard for the setup icon. If you need your company icon to show up in your product installer, please remember to change the "Company name" and rebuild your product.</p>
