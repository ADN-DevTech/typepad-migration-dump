<p>A D N senior manager Cyrille Fauvel write a Slide Library Manager Application for AutoCAD slides/slide Libraries. I thought of sharing the same with all. Please refer the github link <a title="AutoCAD-Slide-Library-Manager" href="https://github.com/ADN-DevTech/AutoCAD-Slide-Library-Manager" target="_self">https://github.com/ADN-DevTech/AutoCAD-Slide-Library-Manager</a> . This Application is a utility which helps you to create, edit, and manage AutoCAD slide libraries. It can read any version of AutoCAD slides, or slide libraries. It can also read any slide format, and convert them into PNG transparent images.</p>

<p>The Github sample has also has a WPF Slide Control. This ‘Slide' control is a WPF control which displays slides under Windows platforms. This WPF control can be included in any WPF project using NuGet. Please refer README section the Github (<a href="https://github.com/ADN-DevTech/AutoCAD-Slide-Library-Manager/blob/master/README.md" target="_self">https://github.com/ADN-DevTech/AutoCAD-Slide-Library-Manager/blob/master/README.md</a> ).</p>
