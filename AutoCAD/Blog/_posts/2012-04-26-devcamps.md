<p><a name="devlabs"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">DevLabs</span></strong></a></p>
<p><strong>&#0160;</strong></p>
<p>Don’t forget about the DevLabs we’re running to coincide with the DevCamps!</p>
<p>DevLabs provide an ideal opportunity to work on your code with the help of an Autodesk expert. Bring your laptop and work on your code as you’d normally do in your own office – the difference is that you have a team of DevTech experts (the same people who answer your questions through DevHelp Online) available to review your code if you’d like, answer your questions, and make suggestions.</p>
