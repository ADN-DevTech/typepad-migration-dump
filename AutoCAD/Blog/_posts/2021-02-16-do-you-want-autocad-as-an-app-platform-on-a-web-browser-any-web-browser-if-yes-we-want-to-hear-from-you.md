<p>The AutoCAD web app team is interested in understanding, in a deeper way, how Autodesk developers are creating solutions for showing drawings, CAD data, floorplans, and objects in a web-first fashion.  
</p><p>Imagine if you could embed AutoCAD drawings and tools directly into your own applications. Help us to determine what to build in the future:
</p><ul><li>What if we were able to expose more AutoCAD capabilities as APIs for you to tailor to your company's needs? 
</li><li>What would you want or need, to allow you to build applications to view, edit, or place objects with precision? 
</li><li>What would you want to keep track of ownership or inventory?
</li><li>Would you like to expand access to your drawing data? 
</li></ul><p>If you are a developer or Autodesk customer interested in assisting Autodesk with this product development research, please answer a few questions here (<a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fautodeskfeedback.az1.qualtrics.com%2Fjfe%2Fform%2FSV_0VbNxcd8uQZNH0i&amp;data=04%7C01%7Cmadhukar.moogala%40autodesk.com%7C526e4e6173124b8d34e008d8ce90c5c0%7C67bff79e7f914433a8e5c9252d2ddc1d%7C0%7C0%7C637486468469220120%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&amp;sdata=%2FLvSmZN2o12onCykoBHlCGf09qO%2B7RIKMVjpqSvxqvc%3D&amp;reserved=0">https://autodeskfeedback.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_0VbNxcd8uQZNH0i</a>).
