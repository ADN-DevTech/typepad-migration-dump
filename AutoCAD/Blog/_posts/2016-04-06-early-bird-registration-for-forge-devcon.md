<p>Early bird registration is due to end on April 15th, so you don&#39;t have much time to buy your ticket at the low cost of $499.</p>
<p>If you&#39;re a student, you can come for free - just sign up for a student ticket using a .edu email address.</p>
<p>We&#39;re still working on the agenda. Visit this link for a list of the classes we currently have planned - <a href="http://forge.autodesk.com/tracks-and-speakers/">http://forge.autodesk.com/tracks-and-speakers/</a></p>
