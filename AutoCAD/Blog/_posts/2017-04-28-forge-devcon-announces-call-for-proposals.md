<p>The Forge Developer Conference (<a href="https://forge.autodesk.com/devcon">Forge DevCon</a>), the largest gathering of design and engineering software developers in the world, is ramping up. This year we are partnering up with Autodesk University (AU). No longer do you need to choose between DevCon and AU. You can do both.</p>
<p>New for this year is call for proposals. We have expanded our efforts and want you to help shape the event. This year is unique as we will be:</p>
