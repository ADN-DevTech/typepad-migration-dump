<p><em>Where Desktop meets the Cloud</em></p>
<p>It’s coming to a city near you and it’s the theme for the
annual Autodesk DevDays Conference and DevLab.&nbsp; Hosted by the Autodesk
Developer Network (ADN), DevDays conferences will be held in cities around the
world from November 2013 through February 2014. </p>
<p>Do you—or any of your
colleagues, create custom applications for Autodesk software?&nbsp; Whether you are integrating your design and engineering tools into
your overall business from sales through maintenance or just getting started—look into joining us at DevDays.&nbsp; We’ll be in 17 cities—from Beijing on November 7<sup>th</sup> to Las Vegas on December 2<sup>nd</sup>
(coinciding with Autodesk University), as well as cities throughout Asia
Pacific, Europe and South America. </p>
<p>A developers-only learning and networking event, the
Autodesk DevDays Conference and DevLab, is the best way for any company doing
commercial or internal software development on Autodesk platform technology to
position for competitive advantage.&nbsp; Our theme “rEvolution – Where Desktop
meets the Cloud” will take you on a deep dive into what’s new in the 2015
desktop products (AutoCAD®, Autodesk® Revit®, Autodesk® Inventor®, AutoCAD®
Civil 3D® and so on) as well as the latest Autodesk® web services and API’s for
cloud and mobile development.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Note that material at any DevDays Conference is forward-looking
and highly confidential so ADN membership is required. &nbsp;If you’d like to
