<p>By <a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/autocad/gopinath-taget.html">Gopinath Taget</a></p>  <p>While researching options to centrally store the presentations and material for the upcoming <a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/autocad/2012/04/devcamps.html" target="_blank">Devcamp</a> events, I researched various options and one of them was using the Amazon <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/s3/" target="_blank">Simple Storage Service</a> (S3) provided by <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/" target="_blank">Amazon Web Services</a>. There are <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/customerapps/Amazon-S3?browse=1" target="_blank">several free tools</a> available for S3 that allows us to browse the S3 storage like any other folder structure.</p>  <p>But one service stood out for me. This is the <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/customerapps/2717?_encoding=UTF8&amp;queryArg=searchQuery&amp;x=0&amp;fromSearch=1&amp;y=0&amp;searchPath=customerapps&amp;searchQuery=S3FM" target="_blank">S3FM</a> web based service. This is a completely browser based service that allows you to upload and download content to your S3 storage without having to download any tool or install any software. All you need to provide is an access key and a secret key. I loved it.</p>  <p>The only thing I was slightly concerned about was that the site has a “Beta” stamp and it appears to have been in operation 2009. I hope the developers are continuing to invest in maintaining this site. Also it would be great if the users were given a choice to provide credentials. I would have preferred to use my login/password rather than my access/secret key. </p>  <p>If you are interested in a desktop based client however, there are several choices. <a href="http://www.cloudberrylab.com/free-amazon-s3-explorer-cloudfront-IAM.aspx" target="_blank">Cloud Berry</a> and <a href="http://s3browser.com/" target="_blank">S3 Browser</a> are a couple I have tried and use on a regular basis.</p>
