<p>By <a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/autocad/gopinath-taget.html">Gopinath Taget</a></p>  <p>It was <a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/autocad/stephen-preston.html" target="_blank">Stephen Preston</a> who first mentioned this to me. He has been developing and debugging on an android device for some time now. It was always a little painful to setup debugging for an Android device on my Windows 7 machine. I have the latest version of eclipse and all the bells and whistles that go with it for android programming. But I could not just “plug and play” my android device into my Windows 7 machine and expect it to just work.</p>  <p>For the Sony Tablet S, I had to download an <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1488822" target="_blank">unofficial driver</a> and install it. I found this after a lot of thrashing around. Similarly for my personal Samsung Galaxy Nexus, I had to look around a lot to find the <a href="http://www.samsung.com/us/support/owners/product/SPH-L700ZKASPR" target="_blank">right driver</a> so Eclipse can recognize it as an Android device for debugging.</p>  <p>Meanwhile, Stephen mentioned that he did not have to do anything to get it to work on a Mac. So I tested it and sure enough, I just had to plug in my Sony Tablet S using the USB&lt;—&gt;micro-USB interface and it just worked. Pure Joy!</p>
