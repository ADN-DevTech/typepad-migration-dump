<p>As you may have seen already, AutoCAD 2014 is coming with a brand new JavaScript API that will allow a new wave of programmers to interact with it.</p>
<p>Whether you are an experienced web developer or a complete newbie in that area, this DevTv will take you through the steps required to get started programming AutoCAD in JavaScript. A previous experience with one of the existing AutoCAD API, such as ObjectARX or .Net is however a plus.</p>
<p>Here are the topics I cover during the presentation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>I. Introduction to JavaScript</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>II. JavaScript API in AutoCAD</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>III. Extending AutoCAD JavaScript API</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>You will also find the samples that I am demo-ing as part of the attached material below. Note: Firefox or Chrome are recommended browsers if you are playing the video using the html link, IE may behave strangely.</p>
