<p>It is my pleasure to announce the launch of the AutoCAD API wishlist survey for 2012. We’re taking a slightly different approach for this year by asking some more general questions and focusing on future technologies, rather than specific AutoCAD features. I hope you’ll be willing to give 5-10 minutes of your time to take the survey – the results will be used to guide the efforts of our engineering team.</p>
<p>Here is the link to the survey - <a href="http://www.zoomerang.com/Survey/WEB22FYFDDAZ88" title="http://www.zoomerang.com/Survey/WEB22FYFDDAZ88">http://www.zoomerang.com/Survey/WEB22FYFDDAZ88</a>.</p>
<p>The survey will remain open until June 22nd.</p>
<p>Update June 26th 2012: The survey is now closed. Thank you to everyone who participated.</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>
