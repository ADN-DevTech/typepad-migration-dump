<p>The ADN AutoCAD Utilities are a set of ActiveX® controls and utilities developed by the ADN Developer Technical Services team to expose functionality that is not easily implemented using the existing official AutoCAD APIs. The controls may be used free of charge for application development and deployment, subject to the terms and conditions defined in the License Agreement.</p>
<p>These are controls that were previously posted to the ADN website that we’re now posting in public.<br />&nbsp;<br />The controls are covered by a license agreement – which must be accepted as part of the installation process. It is important to read the license agreement before using the controls in your own applications.</p>
<p>What you get with this install:</p>
<p>1) The utilities and controls<br />2) Help document and samples<br />3) Merge Modules for the utilities and controls. These are installer modules that you can merge into the MSI installer for your own application, allowing you to distribute the utilities with your applications that use them. Please look up the documentation in the Merge Modules section for more information.</p>
<p>Note: Some of these utilities are OCX controls while the others are provided as ObjectARX® applications. For consistency, none of the utilities are registered during installation of this package. Therefore, please ensure you register these utilities before use. All the ActiveX controls (*.OCX and *.DLL) can be registered by simple running the "regsvr32" command (e.g. regsvr32 AcadLayer.ocx) in the command line. The ObjectARX applications are self registering and would register themselves the first time they are loaded into AutoCAD.</p>
