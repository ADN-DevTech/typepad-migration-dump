<p>AutoCAD customization documentation team is conducting the survey on AutoCAD Developer Documentation. This survey is to collect information about your impression of the developer documentation and to determine our priorities. I hope you’ll be willing to give few minutes of your time to take the survey – the results will be used to guide the efforts of our developer documentation team.</p>
<p>Here is the link to the survey <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/QXNH7VQ">https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/QXNH7VQ</a>.&#0160;This survey will be active till 5/31/2016</p>
