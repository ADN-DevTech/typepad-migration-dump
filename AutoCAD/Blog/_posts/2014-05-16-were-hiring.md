<p>Autodesk is in the process of launching a large number of new cloud services – all of which are designed as platforms for developers to build upon.&#0160; We need to tell the world about these new APIs.&#0160; As the successful candidate, you will join the Developer Technical Services team (our developer evangelist team at Autodesk, and part of our Cloud Platforms Division).</p>

</ul>
<p>To be successful you will have the following attributes:</p>
<ul>
