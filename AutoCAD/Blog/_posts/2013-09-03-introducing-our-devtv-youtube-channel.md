<p>By <a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/autocad/stephen-preston.html">Stephen Preston</a></p>
<p>For your delight and delectation, and as part of our <a href="http://www.autodesk.com/adnopen" target="_blank">ADN Open</a> project, we&#39;ve now created an Autodesk DevTV YouTube channel as a central place for you to browse and view our DevTV screencasts. </p>
<p>At the moment, its mostly a selection of old recordings we&#39;ve posted in other places in the past. Our plan is to post all our DevTV videos there in future, and link to them from our blogs and elsewhere. </p>

<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>Please don&#39;t hesitate to send me your feedback and suggestions on the channel. We want to make it as easy as possible for you to find the information you need (and this is the first YouTube Channel I&#39;ve ever created, so I&#39;m sure I&#39;ve overlooked some usability features :-).</p>
