<p>The Autodesk Exchange Apps Hackathon event is over. We have received more than <strong>180</strong> Apps as part of this event.</p>
<p>On behalf of the Autodesk Developer Network (ADN) team I’d like to say a big “thank you” to all the publishers who has registered and submitted Apps to Autodesk exchange store.&#0160;</p>
