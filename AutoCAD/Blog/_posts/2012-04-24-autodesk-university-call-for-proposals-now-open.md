<p>The AU 2012 Call for Proposals is now open. Click on the link below to go to the AU website to find out more.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve already submitted my usual &quot;AutoCAD APIs: Meet the Experts&quot; panel session proposal (described last year as &#39;the geekiest session at AU&#39; :-D), and I&#39;ve been&#0160;walking around the San Rafael office today pestering some of the AutoCAD senior architects to sit on the panel. I&#39;ll also be proposing a few classes on publishing apps in the <a href="http://apps.exchange.autodesk.com" target="_blank">Exchange store</a>.</p>
<p>Many of our DevTech team will be presenting classes at AU, as usual. We have a few classes on cloud and mobile development in the works this year (surprise, surprise).&#0160;We&#39;ll be there anyway for the Autodesk Developer Network Annual Conference, and its fun to stay on to present and attend a few classes, and to meet lots of programmers using Autodesk APIs.</p>
<p>If you have some expertise (programming or otherwise) that you&#39;d like to share, then why not submit a proposal? We&#39;re always looking for new and exciting classes.</p>
