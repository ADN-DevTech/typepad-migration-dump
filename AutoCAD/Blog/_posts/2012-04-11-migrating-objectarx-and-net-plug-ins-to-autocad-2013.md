<p>Here are two videos documenting the simple steps required to migrate your AutoCAD ObjectARX and .NET plug-ins to AutoCAD 2013. The videos were recorded for the benefit of our Autodesk Developer Network partners during the Beta cycle, which means you’ll see/hear references to AutoCAD ‘Jaws’. Jaws was the codename for AutoCAD 2013 during development, so just substitute ‘2013’ every time you see/hear the word ‘Jaws’.</p>
<p>Download the videos from the following links, extract the files from the zip, and click in the HTML or MP4 file to play the video.</p>
