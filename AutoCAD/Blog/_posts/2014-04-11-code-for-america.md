<p>Earlier this week I drove in to San Francisco to attend a meetup for the &#39;<a href="http://www.meetup.com/DeveloperAdvocates/" target="_blank">SF Developer Advocates</a>&#39; group - my first visit to this group. The meeting itself was interesting - there were about 15 &#39;developer advocates, so it was easy to talk to everyone. But the reason I&#39;m mentioniong it on this blog isn&#39;t for the meetup, its for the organizers.</p>
<p>The meetup was hosted by Code for America - a non-profit organization that helps programmers write code that helps their local communities (and encourages cities to expose data that those programmer scan use). I think this is a great idea, so the least I could do is give them a mention on DevBlog.</p>
<p>So here&#39;s a big Friday Shout Out for:</p>
