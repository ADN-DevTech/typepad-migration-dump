<p>By <a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/autocad/philippe-leefsma.html" target="_self">Philippe Leefsma</a></p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>AutoCAD 2013, codename Jaws, is coming with a brand new feature in the API that will benefit .Net developers: the Dynamic.Net API.</p>  <p>You may be already familiar or read about the new “dynamic” functionality introduced by .Net Framework 4.0. Well, in case you haven’t no worries, this DevTV will take you through the basics and main advantages of dynamic.Net.</p>  <p>The AutoCAD 2013 .Net API is leveraging the dynamic functionality provided by .Net 4.0 by implementing custom logic on top of the DLR or Dynamic Language Runtime, the core supporter of dynamic .Net.</p>  <p>Why is it relevant for you as an AutoCAD.Net developer? We can mention straight away a new simplified syntax when writing AutoCAD.Net programs, for example no need to create transactions to access our database objects when using the dynamic.Net API. Your code will look significantly more compact and easier to read, especially for somebody who start learning the API.</p>  <p>Another significant functionality is the ability to perform LINQ based queries on the AutoCAD Database and its entities…</p>  <p>For a complete overview on the topic, including C# and VB.Net code samples, download the AutoCAD Dynamic.Net API DevTV <a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/autocad/Downloads/DevTV%20-%20Dynamic.Net.zip" target="_self">here</a> !</p>
