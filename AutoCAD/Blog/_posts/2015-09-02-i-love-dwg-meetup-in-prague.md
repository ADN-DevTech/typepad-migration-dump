<p><strong>Working with DWG files using third party libraries? Querying? Viewing? Editing?</strong><br /> <strong>Wrestling with how to expand your solutions to mobile and the web?&#0160; And really want to avoid having to build different/new code bases to support desktop, mobile and web apps?</strong><br /> <strong>Near Prague?</strong><strong>&#0160;</strong><br /> <strong>Join us at the upcoming&#0160;<a href="http://www.meetup.com/I-Love-DWG-Prague/events/225070857/">“I Love DWG” MeetUp</a>&#0160;in Prague on Tuesday evening September 8th.</strong></p>
<p>Autodesk wants to help. Really.</p>
<p>Maybe you are familiar with Autodesk’s&#0160;<a href="http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/index?siteID=123112&amp;id=770257" target="_BLANK">RealDWG</a>&#0160;libraries for reading and writing DWG files. &#0160;But do you know about&#0160;<a href="https://developer.autodesk.com/api/autocadio/" target="_BLANK">AutoCAD I/O</a>&#0160;– “AutoCAD on the Cloud” with much of the power and capability of full AutoCAD but tuned for web development?&#0160; How about the&#0160;<a href="http://developer-autodesk.github.io/" target="_BLANK">Autodesk View &amp; Data web service</a>&#0160;that can help you deliver a customized viewing experience on any device in just a few hours of development time?&#0160; The View &amp; Data web service has a broad and deep API – as well as supporting over 60 3D and 40 2D file formats (most not Autodesk file formats).&#0160; RealDWG, AutoCAD I/O and the translation engine driving the Autodesk View &amp; Data web service are all from the same codebase, too.</p>
<p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/about-the-author.html" target="_self">Kean</a> and I will be showing you a number of sample applications based on the AutoCAD I/O and View &amp; Data web services. &#0160;You’ll get to see how sites such as&#0160;<a href="http://jigsawify.com/" target="_BLANK">http://jigsawify.com</a>&#0160;(AutoCAD I/O) and&#0160;<a href="http://vrok.it/" target="_BLANK">http://vrok.it</a>&#0160;(View &amp; Data) were implemented.</p>
