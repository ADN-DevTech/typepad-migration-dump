you use the Autodesk forums, or if you follow this blog then you will undoubtedly know <a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/autocad/fenton-webb.html" target="_blank">Fenton Webb</a>. That is why I&#39;m writing a post here to announce that - after 13 years serving the AutoCAD developer community - Fenton is moving on to pastures new.</p>
<p>I&#39;m very sad to lose a colleague who joined the ADN team in the same year as I did, but I&#39;m happy for Fenton that he&#39;s found a position with another team at Autodesk where he can work on something new and challenging. Fenton has moved to our installer and licensing team - a team he&#39;s been working very closely with over the last two years as part of his work on the <a href="http://apps.exchange.autodesk.com" target="_blank">Autodesk Exchange store</a> (creating the installer template we use for apps on Autodesk Exchange, as well as the internal tools we use to automate the installer creation process for those apps). Fenton will be working on some top secret projects that I&#39;m not allowed to talk about on this blog.</p>
<p>On behalf of the ADN team and (if I may be so bold) AutoCAD plug-in developers everywhere, I&#39;d like to thank Fenton for his hard work and imagination in serving the AutoCAD developer community over the last 13 years. Hopefully, once he&#39;s settled into his new position, he&#39;ll be able to continue blogging on this site again, and he will be helping us out at AU with several classes in the Developer track and at our DevLab workshop. Bon chance et au revoir Fenton.</p>
<p>Fenton will be very difficult to replace, <a href="http://careers.autodesk.com/san-rafael,-ca/consulting/jobid4357088-senior-developer-consultant-jobs" target="_blank">but we&#39;ll try</a>.</p>
