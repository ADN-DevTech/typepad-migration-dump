<p>We are excited to announce the inaugural
Autodesk<sup>®</sup> Exchange Apps Portathon – a 48 hour virtual web based
coding “festival”.&nbsp; The Exchange Apps Portathon is a community event where
you’ll have the opportunity to work closely with Autodesk engineers in real
time and meet hundreds of other Autodesk software partners from around the
world.&nbsp; It is all designed to help you get your apps ready and published
on Autodesk Exchange Apps.</p>
<p>The Portathon will run for 48 hours,
starting from 12:00 a.m. U.S. Pacific Time (PT) on Friday, September 13, 2013 and
finishing by 11:59 p.m. PT on September 14, 2013. You can participate from
anywhere you have internet access. &nbsp;If you’ve been thinking about
publishing apps in the Exchange Apps store but haven’t found the time then this
event will give you the help you need in real time to get them “out the door”
and start driving the app sales and downloads that bring you or your company
great new customers.</p>
<p>There’s no cost to join the Portathon,
but there is a reward.&nbsp; For all new apps submitted to the Autodesk
Exchange Apps store by midnight on September 14, 2013 and accepted for publication
in the store by October 31, 2013, you will receive US$ 100 per app (for up to
5 apps – US$ 500 total).</p>
<p>Now is the time to decide what apps you want to submit
to meet the midnight September 14 deadline.&nbsp; Register now to participate
