<p>by <a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/autocad/gopinath-taget.html" target="_blank">Gopinath Taget</a></p>  <p>I have been researching Objective C as a part of a class that I am delivering at the AEC and Manufacturing <a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/autocad/2012/04/devcamps.html" target="_blank">Devcamps</a> being held this week and next.</p>  <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objective-C" target="_blank">Objective C</a> is one of several attempts to create an Object Oriented language based off the C programming language constructs (many of us are familiar with other attempts like C++ and Java). Objective C was adopted by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeXT" target="_blank">NeXT</a>, a bay area based IT company founded by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs" target="_blank">Steve Jobs</a> after he left <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc." target="_blank">Apple Inc</a> in the 1980s, as its primary development language. NeXT mainly manufactured proprietary workstations with proprietary hardware, operating system and developer platforms.</p>  <p>In the late 1990s, NeXT was acquired by Apple Inc when then began a multi-year effort to replace its old and aging Mac OS with a new Operating System based on the proprietary NeXT based Operating System. With this came all the tools and trappings of NeXT including Objective C which became the primary language for Mac programming. When Apple Inc started manufacturing mobile devices, it inherited Objective C as its legacy from the Mac programming environment.</p>
