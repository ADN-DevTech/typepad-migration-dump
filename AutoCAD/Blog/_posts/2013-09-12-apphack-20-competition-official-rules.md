<p>The theme of the event is “Connecting Autodesk to the&nbsp; Cloud”<strong>
–&nbsp;and this is open to creative</strong> <strong>interpretation.</strong> Perhaps you
can think of a way to wire our software&nbsp;into your favorite social media network or make use of infinite
cloud computing to carry out&nbsp; CPU-intensive tasks. Or maybe you have a way
to help users better&nbsp;visualize and share their ideas&nbsp;using a web
browser. Build a standalone app for AutoCAD, Revit, Inventor or BIM 360 Glue.
Or build an app that takes advantage of the integration capabilities of BIM 360
Glue with either of the 3 other products: AutoCAD, Revit and Inventor! It’s up
to you. Subject to the Rules and Regulations, submit something &nbsp;you’ve already written or&nbsp;write something
new.</p>
<p>Do you love our products, but you’ve never developed an app
before? No problem.
