<p>By <a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/autocad/stephen-preston.html">Stephen Preston</a></p>  <p><a href="http://au.autodesk.com"><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="/assets/image_227821.jpg" width="500" height="99" /></a></p>  <p>The <a href="https://www.autodeskuniversity2012.com/connect/search.ww" target="_blank">AU 2012 class catalog</a> has just been released over at <a href="http://au.autodesk.com" target="_blank">au.autodesk.com</a>. Go check it out to see some of the great topics and speakers we have lined up for you. This being DevBlog, I’m mostly interested in the Customization and Programming track. Filter for that track and for the product you’re interested in to see the full list of classes that might interest you. </p>  <p>We have our usual range of expert speakers from our developer community and from the ADN team and our product development teams. I’m particularly excited that our AutoCAD software architects team have a significantly larger presence than usual:</p>  <ul>   <li><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/" target="_blank"><strong>Kean Walmsley</strong></a> (it still seems weird to be referring to Kean by his <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2011/12/moving-on-and-yet-not.html" target="_blank">new[ish] job title</a>) has a class and roundtable on cloud and mobile development (presumably drawing on what he learned from his <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2012/06/cloud-mobile-series-summary.html" target="_blank">excellent blog series</a>), and also a class on developing Metro style applications.</li>    <li><strong>Ravi Krishnaswarmy</strong> will be demonstrating the benefits of ‘Platform as a Service’ (PaaS) by demonstrating how to use ObjectARX to integrate AutoCAD with Google Docs.</li>    <li><strong>Christer Janson</strong> will be showing us how to write games in ObjectARX for AutoCAD, using the games he created at the recent internal <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2012/03/in-the-bay-area.html" target="_blank">Autodesk AppHack event</a>. (These are really cool – I had to uninstall them from my computer so I could get some work done).</li>    <li><strong>Albert Szilvasy</strong> will be presenting a class titled “The Confluence of AutoCAD® Mobile, Desktop, and the Cloud”, although past experience tells us that this is no guide to what he’ll actually end up discussing (but whatever it is, we also know from past experience that its going to be something very interesting <img style="border-bottom-style: none; border-right-style: none; border-top-style: none; border-left-style: none" class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-smile" alt="Smile" src="/assets/image_863535.jpg" />).</li> </ul>  <p>I’ll be making good use of their attendance at AU by making them the core of my regular “AutoCAD APIs: Meet the Experts&quot; panel session – a class for which I was proud to have described last year as ‘probably the geekiest class at AU’. This panel is as much about meeting your fellow programmers so you can recognize them when you see them hanging around LAs Vegas bars as it is about asking questions.</p>  <p>I’m also running a roundtable on architecting and publishing apps on <a href="http://apps.exchange.autodesk.com" target="_blank">Autodesk Exchange</a>.</p>  <p>Just from the above mentioned classes, you can see that a key theme for this year is integrating your applications with cloud services, mobile apps (and app stores <img style="border-bottom-style: none; border-right-style: none; border-top-style: none; border-left-style: none" class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-smile" alt="Smile" src="/assets/image_863535.jpg" />). But we also have lots of our more regular AutoCAD API classes (and classes for our other product APIs as well, of course). And for <a href="http://www.autodesk.com/joinadn">ADN Standard and ADN Professional</a> members, we’ll be running our usual DevDays and DevLab events.</p>  <p>Check out all the info posted on the <a href="http://au.autodesk.com" target="_blank">AU website</a>. Early registration for AU members opens on August 28th. See you in Vegas <img style="border-bottom-style: none; border-right-style: none; border-top-style: none; border-left-style: none" class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-openmouthedsmile" alt="Open-mouthed smile" src="/assets/image_274302.jpg" />.</p>
