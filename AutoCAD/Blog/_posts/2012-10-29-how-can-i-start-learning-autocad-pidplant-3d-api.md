<p>By <a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/autocad/marat-mirgaleev.html" target="_self">Marat Mirgaleev</a></p>  <p><strong>Issue</strong></p>  <p><em>I would like to customize AutoCAD Plant 3D for my company needs. Is there any API for </em><em>this? How can get it?</em></p>  <p><strong>Solution</strong></p>  <p>A good point to start with is the page on the Autodesk Developer Center, describing the API for AutoCAD P&amp;ID and AutoCAD Plant 3D:</p>  <p><a href="http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/index?siteID=123112&amp;id=15460551">http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/index?siteID=123112&amp;id=15460551</a></p>  <p>The API for these two products is called Plant SDK and can be downloaded from the page mentioned above. It includes documentation, code samples, include files and libraries for C++ development and .NET libraries.    </p>
