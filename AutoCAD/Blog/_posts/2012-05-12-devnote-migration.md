<p>By <a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/autocad/stephen-preston.html">Stephen Preston</a></p>
<p>You&#39;ll be seeing a flood of blog postings over the next month or so, as we migrate our collection of DevNotes (what we call technical solutions in ADN) from the members-only <a href="adn.autodesk.com" target="_self">ADN website</a> to this blog. Once this is done, we&#39;ll be retiring those DevNotes on the ADN website and writing all our new articles directly on this blog. This also marks our last ever DevNote migration project - updating several thousand DevNotes every time AutoCAD breaks binary compatibility. In future, we&#39;ll simply make a new post if something changes. That means you may have to tweak code you find in very old blog posts in the future.</p>
<p>I also expect the rate of posting to reduce once that migration is done, as we move to blogging about interesting new things we&#39;re working on, and new questions we&#39;ve been asked. Sorry in advance if we overload your RSS feed.</p>
<p>BTW A big thank you to those of you who are already posting comments. We chose a blog format because it allows us to post information quickly - without the overhead of a formal publishing process and its associated proofreading and editorial work. Because of that, you will sometimes find code that isn&#39;t opimized, isn&#39;t localized, and (hopefully very rarely) contains a bug. That&#39;s where the other convenient aspect of a blog comes in: its easy for you - dear reader - to write comments or suggestions, and for us to go back and tweak the code we post if necessary. We&#39;re always happy to receive constructive comments, questions and suggestions.</p>
