sole and absolute discretion, to disqualify any entrant who: (a) tampers with

of class action. By entering the Portathon, each entrant submits to the
jurisdiction of those courts and waives any objection to those courts, whether
on the basis of jurisdiction, venue, inconvenience of the forum, or otherwise.
