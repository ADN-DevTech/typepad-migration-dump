<p>I was totally stunned with&#0160;awe when an engineer at Autodesk showed me the AutoCAD 2014 Easter Egg that they had implemented as a nice surprise for everyone, basically geared to show off the&#0160;latest 3D graphics engine. </p>
<p>After some rather convoluted keystrokes and mouse&#0160;movements (it took me a few attempts which is of course part and parcel of all computer Easter Eggs) I was able to play, wait for it, a full emulation version of Call Of Duty Modern Warfare 3!! Absolutely incredible, I&#39;m sure you agree!!!! I LOVE THIS GAME SO MUCH!</p>
<p>
What really surprised me was how all this happened just from a passing conversation&#0160;with one of the AutoCAD Architects in the tea room a few months back. I had mentioned to him that I had got into a lot of trouble with my wife after receiving the game on PS3 for my birthday a couple of years back and how I then got sucked into played the game every evening for hours on end, for months and months...</p>
<p>All was fine with me playing the game in the beginning, however, my lack of attention towards my better half started to wear thin. The long evenings where I was online using my headset and microphone for the team matches started enduring those heated/embarrassing online &quot;world-wide broad-casted&quot; boyfriend/girlfriend/husband/wife confrontations. This was where my wife could be heard shouting at me from another room in the house, basically, to &quot;stop playing that game&quot;, etc etc and I&#39;d reply by saying &quot;This is the last game honey...I promise...&quot;. Of course, this was followed by all the other gamers empathetically laughing at what they were hearing...</p>
<p>Back to the tea room discussion with the AutoCAD architect - so, I had mentioned over tea how it would be great to be able to play at home and then carry on my score the next day at work somehow. Unbelievably, they actually made it happen!! Not only did the game run perfectly (albeit using my keyboard and mouse via the Unreal Tournament setup), I was even prompted for my PS3 log-in details, which to my surprise actually logged me into the PS3 network (which I thought needed some PS3 hardware to verify...?) Hmm, not sure I should really be talking about this on here...&#0160;</p>
<p>Anyway, there&#39;s no sound, but everything else works a treat!! I&#39;m running Windows 8 64bit but found that on my laptop I did have to re-size my drawing window a little to make it run smoothly, check it out...&#0160; </p>

<p>OK Now; here are the keystrokes and mouse moves that you have to input in order to initialize and run the Egg… Have fun!!!!&#0160;</p>
<ol>
<li>&lt;CAPS ON&gt;</li>
<li>‘A’</li>
<li>Move Mouse about 3 inches to the right</li>
<li>Now Move Mouse about 3 inches down</li>
<li>Move the mouse directly up to form a ‘P’ shape fairly quickly (then don’t touch the mouse again)</li>
<li>&lt;CAPS OFF&gt;</li>
<li>‘r’</li>
<li>&lt;CAPS ON&gt;</li>
<li>‘I’</li>
<li>Now move the mouse directly down about 2 inches and to the right 2 inches making an ‘L’ shape (again, once done don’t touch the mouse again)</li>
<li>&lt;SPACE BAR&gt;</li>
<li>‘F’</li>
<li>Number zero</li>
<li>Number zero</li>
<li>Finally, move the mouse directly down about 2 inches and to the right 2 inches making the ‘L’ shape in one continuous movement (don’t touch the mouse and wait 5 seconds)</li>
<li>You&#39;ll see some text appear on the command line &quot;Egg Initializing, please wait...and up pops the game!&#0160;</li>
</ol>
<p>What an amazing Easter Egg... Enjoy! :-)</p>
