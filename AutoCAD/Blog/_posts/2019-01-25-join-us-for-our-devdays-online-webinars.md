<p>Join us for our special series of webinars where we’ll be going over some of the topics covered last year&#39;s DevCon events in detail (see full list below).&#0160; These webinars are a great opportunity for you to learn about&#0160;<a href="https://forge.autodesk.com">Autodesk Forge</a>&#0160;and, of course, where Autodesk is taking the desktop platforms in the coming year.</p>
<p>Click on the links below to register today for the webinar(s) of your choice.&#0160;All webinars start at 8am PST (4pm GMT, 5pm CET, 11am EST). If the session timing is inconvenient for you to attend (which is true for most of our partners in Asia), you can rest assured we will be recording all the sessions and will post them on the web for your later viewing.&#0160;Registration is open to all except where noted below.&#0160;</p>
