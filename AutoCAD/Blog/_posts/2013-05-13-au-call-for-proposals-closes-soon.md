<p>By<a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/autocad/stephen-preston.html"> Stephen Preston</a></p>
<p>A quick reminder that the <a href="http://au.autodesk.com/?nd=call_for_proposals" target="_blank">AU Call for Proposals</a> closes on May 19th, so you don&#39;t have much time if you want to be considered as a presenter this year. </p>
<p>We&#39;re keen to continue our theme from the last two years of scheduling a significant number of classes about general programming concepts and technologies in addition to classes about specific Autodesk APIs.</p>
<p>(Note that the &#39;Customization and Programming&#39; track has been renamed to &#39;Developer&#39; this year).</p>
