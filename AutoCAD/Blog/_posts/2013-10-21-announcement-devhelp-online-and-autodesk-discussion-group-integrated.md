<p>We are pleased to announce a <strong>significant enhancement</strong> to our Autodesk
Developer Network (ADN) Support service. Apart from asking questions privately
through DevHelp Online, you can now also ask your questions on the <a href="http://forums.autodesk.com/">Autodesk Discussion
Group</a> (Autodesk Forums). Here is the API forums list that integrated
with the DevHelp Online. </p>

<p>Many ADN partners already make extensive use of the <a href="http://forums.autodesk.com">Autodesk discussion forums</a> – asking
API questions on the forums as well as through DevHelp Online in order to
benefit from the advice of as wide a range of experts as possible. But there is
a problem with relying solely on a public forum for support - sometimes you
don’t get an answer to your question. We’re fixing that problem by creating
tighter integration between the Autodesk API forums and DevHelp Online (the ADN
support portal).&nbsp;</p>
<p>From now on, if you ask a question on one of our managed Autodesk
API public forums, you will benefit from the following enhanced support:&nbsp;</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp; Members of the ADN DevTech team can identify you as an ADN partner
on the forum and prioritize answering your questions.</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp; If your question goes unanswered, it is automatically escalated to
DevHelp Online to ensure it receives the attention it deserves.</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp; If you’re not happy with the answer you’ve received from one of
your peers, you can escalate the question to DevHelp Online yourself.</p>
<p>If you’ve not used the Autodesk discussion forums before, we
encourage you to give them a try. You may be surprised at the breadth and depth
of knowledge freely given by the community. With these enhancements for ADN
Standard and Professional partners, you no longer have to choose between asking
Autodesk or asking your forum peers – now you can ask Autodesk and your forum
peers in the same place.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And while you’re visiting the forum, why not browse around and
contribute to some of the discussions.&nbsp;</p>
Taking advantage of this
new service is really easy. The account you already use to login to DevHelp
Online will also allow you to login to the Autodesk forums. If you are an ADN
member, please visit the ADN extranet for<a href="http://adn.autodesk.com/adn/servlet/item?siteID=4814862&amp;id=22170101"> more
detailed information</a> on how to setup your forum account so that you are
correctly recognized as an ADN member and benefit from this enhanced support.
