<p>Autodesk recently finished the first ever Cloud Accelerator where several companies were selected to come into the San Francisco office to work on their applications, which use the Autodesk cloud technology in some way.&#0160; They were able to work directly with the ADN and cloud teams to accelerate the development of their applications.&#0160;</p>
<p>The first event was so successful, there has been another one scheduled for June 1-12. &#0160;The deadline for applications is April 19th, so it’s quickly approaching. Visit&#0160;<a href="http://autodeskcloudaccelerator.com/">Autodesk Cloud Accelerator</a>&#0160;for more information.</p>
<p>Here are some highlights from the last event.</p>
