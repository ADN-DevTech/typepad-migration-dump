<p>By <a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/autocad/wayne-brill.html" target="_self">Wayne Brill</a></p>  <p><b>Issue</b></p>  <p>I am following the instructions from the OEM 2011 Developer's Guide. My install works fine however the readme.chm file that I put in the Docs directory (as instructed) is not being displayed. Is there a way to get the readme.chm to automatically display if I have checked the &quot;View Content&quot; of the readme after the install?</p>  <p><a name="section2"></a></p>  <p><b>Solution</b></p>  <p>Instead of creating a directory named &quot;Docs&quot;, name the directory &quot;Help&quot;. With this change the readme.chm file will be launched after the install if the check box is selected.</p>
