<p>By<a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/autocad/stephen-preston.html"> Stephen Preston</a></p>
<p>Autodesk announced today a call for Beta testers for the
newest addition to our product line – the <strong><em>Autodesk Layout</em></strong> - an Android-based
tablet designed specifically for drafting.</p>
<p>Tablet devices targeted at specific markets are nothing new
– as witnessed by the success of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0083PWAPW/ref=sa_menu_kdpt" target="_blank">Amazon Kindle Fire HD</a> and the <a href="http://www.barnesandnoble.com/p/nook-hd-barnes-noble/1110060426?r=1" target="_blank">Barnes &amp;
Noble Nook HD</a> in the ‘eReader’ domain. With the Layout, Autodesk plan to do
the same for drafting.</p>
<p><a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2012/02/the-autocad-2013-core-console.html" target="_blank">Readers of Kean Walmsley’s blog will be familiar with the
AutoCAD “Big Split” project</a>. This was a very significant architectural
refactoring of AutoCAD to isolate the AutoCAD ‘application logic’ (AcCore) from
the user interface, which has led to the creation of a number new ‘AcCore-based’
products, such as AutoCAD for Mac, AutoCAD WS, and (of
course) the AcCoreConsole ‘scripting engine’ that ships as part of the AutoCAD
2013 console.</p>
<p>Autodesk Layout uses AcCore to implement an Android native
version of AutoCAD. This in turn sits on top of an enhanced Android operating
system, and includes the following enhanced features:</p>
<ul>
<li>All the functionality of AutoCAD on a tablet
device.</li>
<li>The ability to work with DWG files stored
locally (LS mode) or with files stored on the Autodesk 360 server (WS mode).</li>
<li>Full ObjectARX, .NET and LISP emulation,
allowing Layout to load almost any app designed for AutoCAD.</li>
<li>Seamless integration with the Autodesk Exchange
Apps store.
</li>
</ul>
<p>But that’s just the software. The device itself boasts
a groundbreaking flexible (foldable) OLED dsplay incorporating ultra-high
precision touch sensitivity. The OLED screen unfolds from the tablet body and
can be laid flat on a traditional drafting board to create a comfortable and
intuitive drafting environment in the office.</p>

<p><em>Image: Using the Layout flexible OLED display.</em></p>
<p>For ease of input, the Layout offers a range of &#39;touch&#39; input devices:</p>

<p><em>Image: Layout input device options.</em></p>
<p>In the field, the ‘hard’ screen can be used for lower
precision markup.</p>
<p>The Autodesk Layout will initially ship in 3 variants, the
model numbers reflecting the size of the foldable OLED screen (conforming to
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_216" target="_blank">ISO 216</a> standards for easy drafting):</p>
<ul>
<li>Layout A4 – 210mm x 297 mm OLED screen.</li>
<li>Layout A3 – 297mm x 420mm OLED screen.</li>
<li>Layout A2 – 420mm x 594mm OLED screen.</li>
</ul>
<p>Future A1 and A0 versions are planned.</p>
<p>Asked about this announcement at a press conference this
morning, Autodesk representative Cal Brass stated <em>“Autodesk have a long and proud history of
offering best in class solutions for the design community. However, I make a
point of never commenting on technology articles on April 1<sup>st</sup>”.</em></p>

tester.</p>
