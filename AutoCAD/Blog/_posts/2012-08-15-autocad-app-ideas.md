<p>By <a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/autocad/stephen-preston.html">Stephen Preston</a></p>  <p>The <a href="http://apps.exchange.autodesk.com/" target="_blank">Autodesk Exchange Apps store</a> is going great guns now, averaging over 9000 unique visitors a week (and rising). We’re also seeing an increasing variety of apps available on the store. Nevertheless, our store manager is keen for more, more more …</p>  <p>Here is a list of some of the suggestions he’s come up with for app ideas:</p>  <div>   <ul>     <li><strong>Simple Increment Tool</strong>: A simple tool which would increment objects tags or wherever incremental values are needed. This was a favorite suggestion from a recent Facebook survey.</li>      <li><strong>Google Doc Spreadsheet Integration</strong>: An app which would allow viewing/editing of an AutoCAD table in Google documents (spreadsheet). This would open up many collaboration opportunities.</li>      <li><strong>Stretch Reminder</strong>: A simple app which would remind a user to take a break from time to time to stretch and exercise.</li>      <li><strong>.NET Macro Recorder</strong>: A utility which would convert recorded macros to .NET code.</li>      <li><strong>Music Feed</strong>: Plug-in which could allow a user to manage music without leaving their Autodesk project through integration with one of the many streaming music services. (Ed: And automatically choose tracks to suit your mood depending on what AutoCAD commands you’re using <img style="border-bottom-style: none; border-right-style: none; border-top-style: none; border-left-style: none" class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-winkingsmile" alt="Winking smile" src="/assets/image_793150.jpg" />.)</li>      <li><strong>Custom Help</strong>: A tool to share and compile commonly used commands/sysvar in a small office or team. This would replace CAD ‘cheat sheets’ and serve as an in-CAD wiki.</li>      <li><strong>Sketching/Designing in program</strong>: Simple sketching tools within AutoCAD, perhaps integrated with SketchBook Designer. </li>      <li><strong>Preview Handler for Outlook</strong>: Handler which would allow previews of DWG/DWF files attached to emails.</li>   </ul>    <p>But I’m sure that you, dear reader, can come up with some even better ideas (and probably already have). </p>    <p><em>Wait … No … Don’t tell me!</em> </p>    <p>Go ahead and submit your finished app to the Exchange store. It could be the start of a beautiful friendship <img style="border-bottom-style: none; border-right-style: none; border-top-style: none; border-left-style: none" class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-smilewithtongueout" alt="Smile with tongue out" src="/assets/image_277528.jpg" />.
