<p>When you are building automations, workflows, plugins, add-ons, and cloud-services, how do YOU design YOUR APIs? What guides and tools do you use? And what would you love to have to make your process better?<p>
<h4>Who we're looking for:</h4>

<p>Software developers working with Autodesk APIs and SDKs, in the AEC, PDM and M&amp;E industries</p>
<p>My colleague Michelangelo Capraro, is hosting a workshop which is geared towards API users and developers - any of our customers developing tools using any of our SDKs or APIs - and trying to find out if there are things Autodesk can provide to make their work easier. </p><p><a href="https://adndevblog.typepad.com/.a/6a0167607c2431970b02a2eed74ed9200d-pi"><img width="726" height="467" title="image (1)" style="display: inline; background-image: none;" alt="image (1)" src="/assets/image_966776.jpg" border="0"></a></p>
