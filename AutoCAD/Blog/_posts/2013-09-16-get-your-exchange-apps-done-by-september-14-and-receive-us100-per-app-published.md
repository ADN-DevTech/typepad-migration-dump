<p>Do
you have apps you want to publish on Autodesk® Exchange Apps but can’t find the
time to actually do it? &#0160;We have some good news - &#0160;the Autodesk
Developer Network team is going to give you some of our time to help you get
the job done.</p>
<p>You
are invited to join the inaugural Autodesk® Exchange Apps Portathon – a 48 hour
virtual web based coding “festival” that will run from&#0160;Friday, September
13 through September 14.&#0160; The Exchange Apps Portathon is a community event
where you’ll have the opportunity to work closely with Autodesk engineers in
real time and learn from the questions asked by Autodesk software partners from
around the world.&#0160; It is all designed to help you get your apps ready and
published on Autodesk Exchange Apps.&#0160; Note: the event is for “new” apps –
whether you are a first-time publisher or an existing publisher with ideas for
additional apps.</p>
