<p>Kean Walmsley has posted a request for feedback from developers who are using graphics intensive AutoCAD applications. Basically, he wants to hear from you if your plug-in checks whether AutoCAD is running its 2D or 3D graphics engine and then makes use of that information.</p>
<p><em>Reading between the lines, this might make you think that the AutoCAD engineering team are considering some interesting things to do with the AutoCAD graphics engine, but I couldn&#39;t possibly comment on that :-).</em></p>
