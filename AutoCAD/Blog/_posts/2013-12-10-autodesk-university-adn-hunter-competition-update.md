<p>I&#39;m waiting for the AU organizers to give me a full dump of the AU Mobile App activity feed. Once I have that, I will announce the three winners (who will each receive an iPad Mini prize) on the ADN DevBlog and in the ADN DevNews newsletter. Preliminary analysis shows that we have at least three people who tracked down every ADN team member at AU, so I&#39;m expecting the competition to go to a tie break.</p>
<p>Sorry for the delay.</p>
<p>(PS If you&#39;ve no idea what I&#39;m talking about then maybe you should have come to AU ;-).</p>
