<p>It is my pleasure to announce the launch of the AutoCAD Developer Documentation Survey. This survey is to collect information about your impression of the developer documentation and to determine our priorities. I hope you’ll be willing to give 5-10 minutes of your time to take the survey – the results will be used to guide the efforts of our developer documentation team.</p>
<p>Here is the link to the survey - <br /><a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/H72RWJC">https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/H72RWJC</a></p>
