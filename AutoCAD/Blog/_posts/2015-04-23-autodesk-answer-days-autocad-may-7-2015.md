<p>Do you have any AutoCAD® or AutoCAD LT® questions that you’ve always wanted to ask?</p>
<p><br />If yes, then join the first in a series of Ask Autodesk Anything events on May 7, 2015. This event is dedicated to answering your questions about AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT. We’ll have some DevTech engineers attending the event to answer your API questions. The event runs from 6 am to 6 pm Pacific Time and will take place in Autodesk Community. Come spend a minute, an hour, or the whole day in the Autodesk Community to interact directly with the folks who bring you your favourite CAD software!</p>
