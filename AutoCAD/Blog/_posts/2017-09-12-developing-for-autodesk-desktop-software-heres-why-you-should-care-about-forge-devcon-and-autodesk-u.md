<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>You’ve been developing solutions based on Autodesk desktop software for years. Business is booming. Your customers love your products. Why should you care about what’s going on at Forge DevCon?</p>
<p>Or …</p>
<p>You’re a desktop software developer. You have plenty of work stacked up for your company’s next software release. How can you persuade your boss to send you to Las Vegas for a week?</p>
<p>Hopefully, this blog post will give you the answers …</p>
<h2>What’s this Forge thing, again?</h2>
<p>If you’ve been paying any attention at all to Autodesk desktop software releases over the last few years, you’ll have noticed that:</p>
<ol>
<li>Autodesk now has a large portfolio of web (SaaS) applications</li>
<li>Autodesk ‘desktop’ software is increasingly making use of web services and integrations with the Autodesk web applications to deliver new features and increase customer productivity.</li>
</ol>
<p>Putting it simply,&#0160;<a href="https://forge.autodesk.com/">Forge</a>&#0160;is Autodesk’s platform of web services APIs and web components that you can use to extend your desktop software in the same way – or to build your own web applications that integrate with the Autodesk web application products. Think of the Forge APIs as Lego blocks – take the ones you need to build your product, leave the rest on the table.&#0160;</p>
<p>Need to present your customer with an interactive 3D model of your design? Easy. Want to generate a Bill of Materials from a Fusion or Inventor model? No problem. Need to integrate BIM 360 into your own workflows? Done!&#0160;</p>
<p>The Forge APIs are the same APIs that Autodesk use in our own products, so you’re drinking the same champagne as we do.</p>
<h2>Ok, but why will coming to Forge DevCon help me?</h2>
<p>There’s a steep learning curve to climb if you’re relatively new to web development (or even if you know web development, but are new to Forge). Coming to Forge DevCon is a great way to get help to quickly climb that curve, by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Asking for 1-1 help and advice from our team of Forge experts at the Forge Answer Bar.</li>
<li>Working through self-paced tutorials, or working on your Forge projects with help from an expert at our&#0160;<a href="https://autodeskuniversity.smarteventscloud.com/connect/search.ww#loadSearch-searchPhrase=devlab&amp;searchType=session&amp;tc=0&amp;sortBy=&amp;p=">Forge DevLab</a>.</li>
<li>Learning Autodesk’s&#0160;<a href="https://autodeskuniversity.smarteventscloud.com/connect/search.ww#loadSearch-searchPhrase=FDC128455&amp;searchType=session&amp;tc=0&amp;sortBy=&amp;p=">strategy for Forge</a>&#0160;from our Senior Executives and Product Managers.</li>
<li>Attending&#0160;<a href="https://autodeskuniversity.smarteventscloud.com/connect/search.ww#loadSearch-searchPhrase=&amp;searchType=session&amp;tc=0&amp;sortBy=&amp;sessionTypeID=7683&amp;i(41028)=148431&amp;p=">in-depth classes</a>&#0160;on the details of particular Forge APIs (including soon to be launched APIs), and also classes specifically for&#0160;<a href="https://autodeskuniversity.smarteventscloud.com/connect/search.ww#loadSearch-searchPhrase=fdc124076+im124938&amp;searchType=session&amp;tc=0&amp;sortBy=&amp;i(41028)=148431&amp;p=">desktop developers migrating to web programming</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://autodeskuniversity.smarteventscloud.com/connect/search.ww#loadSearch-searchPhrase=&amp;searchType=session&amp;tc=0&amp;sortBy=&amp;sessionTypeID=7682&amp;i(41028)=148431&amp;p=">Listening to early adopters</a>&#0160;explain how they’ve used Forge to create new businesses or transform their existing products.</li>
<li>Meeting members of the Forge team and fellow Forge explorers like yourself.</li>
</ul>
<h2>I’m an AutoCAD developer. How will it help me?</h2>
<p>Well, I already mentioned that we’ll have several classes on&#0160;<a href="https://autodeskuniversity.smarteventscloud.com/connect/search.ww#loadSearch-searchPhrase=fdc124076+im124938&amp;searchType=session&amp;tc=0&amp;sortBy=&amp;i(41028)=148431&amp;p=">migrating your desktop (e.g. .NET) development skills to the web</a>, including how to use the Forge APIs to create ‘hybrid’ add-ins.</p>
<p>If you’re developing products that enhance collaboration, then you can learn how to use the&#0160;<a href="https://viewer.autodesk.com/">Forge Viewer</a>&#0160;to help your customers share and markup DWGs, or to&#0160;<a href="https://autodeskuniversity.smarteventscloud.com/connect/search.ww#loadSearch-searchPhrase=FDC124079&amp;searchType=session&amp;tc=0&amp;sortBy=&amp;i(41028)=148431&amp;p=">save their work (and your application specific data) to A360</a>.</p>
<p>Or maybe you’d like to batch process DWGs using the Design Automation for AutoCAD API. You can even use the&#0160;<a href="https://autodeskuniversity.smarteventscloud.com/connect/search.ww#loadSearch-searchPhrase=SD124720&amp;searchType=session&amp;tc=0&amp;sortBy=&amp;i(41028)=148431&amp;p=">Design Automation API</a>&#0160;to extract your custom application data (for example Xdata or Xrecords) so it can be displayed by the Forge Viewer when it loads your DWG.</p>
<p>And what is this&#0160;<a href="https://autodeskuniversity.smarteventscloud.com/connect/search.ww#loadSearch-searchPhrase=SD124704&amp;searchType=session&amp;tc=0&amp;sortBy=&amp;i(41028)=148431&amp;p=">Project Fabric</a>&#0160;that the AutoCAD team have been working on?</p>
<h2>And what about Autodesk University?</h2>
<p>Forge DevCon runs over two days during AU Las Vegas week (November 13<sup>th</sup>-16<sup>th</sup>). Monday 13<sup>th</sup>&#0160;is a dedicated Forge DevCon day, when we have 25 Forge-focused classes available for you, as well as the Forge Village (networking/expo area), Forge Answer Bar and AR/VR Playground. Tuesday 14<sup>th</sup>&#0160;is a joint Forge/AU day, where another 23 Forge DevCon classes will also be open to AU attendees. Tuesday is also&#0160;<a href="https://autodeskuniversity.smarteventscloud.com/connect/search.ww#loadSearch-searchPhrase=devlab&amp;searchType=session&amp;tc=0&amp;sortBy=&amp;p=">Forge DevLab</a>&#0160;Day. DevLab is an informal workshop where you can drop is for as long as you like to ask questions, work on your projects, or work through some self-paced tutorials on Forge APIs, web development or machine learning – all with the help of experts from the Forge team.</p>
<p>But why go home then? The Autodesk University conference (Tuesday 14<sup>th</sup>&#0160;– Thursday 16<sup>th</sup>) offers a huge expo hall, parties, and hundreds of classes aimed at all levels of expertise and covering almost all Autodesk (desktop and web) products – including a full track of ‘<a href="https://autodeskuniversity.smarteventscloud.com/connect/search.ww#loadSearch-searchPhrase=&amp;searchType=session&amp;tc=0&amp;sortBy=&amp;dayID=7512&amp;dayID=7513&amp;dayID=7514&amp;i(40990)=110843&amp;p=">Software Development</a>’ classes.</p>
<h2>Where do I sign up?</h2>
<p>Read&#0160;<a href="https://forge.autodesk.com/blog/ways-get-forge-devcon-pass">this other blog post</a>&#0160;for details of the different ways you can sign up for Forge DevCon: Forge DevCon only; Forge DevCon + AU; or adding Forge DevCon to your existing registration if you already signed up for AU, but forgot to buy your Forge DevCon ticket.&#0160;Register to AU before October 16<sup>th</sup> (earlier bird offer) and save 425$.</p>
<h2>I don’t live in the US, and I don’t plan to visit. Where else can I learn about Forge?</h2>
<p>Although Forge DevCon at Las Vegas is by far our largest Forge conference, we have several other Forge DevCons around the world, and associated with local Autodesk University events:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://au.autodesk.co.jp/17/forge.html">Forge DevCon Tokyo</a>&#0160;– in Japanese.</li>
<li><a href="https://forge.autodesk.com/devcon-germany">Forge DevCon Darmstadt</a>&#0160;– in English.</li>
<li>Forge DevCon Beijing – in Chinese, and not associated with an Autodesk University.</li>
</ul>
<p>We will also have a Forge booth at&#0160;<a href="http://au.autodesk.com/india">Autodesk University Bangalore</a>.</p>
