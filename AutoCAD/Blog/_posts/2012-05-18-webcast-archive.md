<p>By <a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/autocad/stephen-preston.html">Stephen Preston</a></p>  <p>A quick post to advertise the existence of our <a href="http://www.adskconsulting.com/adn/cs/api_course_webcast_archive.php" target="_blank">ADN webcast archive</a> for those of you who haven’t found it yet. The recordings posted here are of live webcasts, so they are a little raw in places. And some of them are getting a little old now, but there’s still plenty of useful information there.</p>  <p>Talking of recordings, another great resource is the AU Online archive. Here’s a link to the <a href="http://au.autodesk.com/?nd=class_listing&amp;filter_keywords=&amp;chunk=15&amp;filter_track=6&amp;filter_software=&amp;filter_speaker=&amp;filter_year=All&amp;filter_language=English&amp;filter_type=&amp;whichfilter=all" target="_blank">list classes from the Customization and Programming track</a>. Many of these include recordings of the live AU presentations. The rest should at least have downloads of the class handouts. You’ll need an AU Online login to download the material.</p>  <p>Enjoy!</p>  <p>And have a great weekend <img style="border-bottom-style: none; border-right-style: none; border-top-style: none; border-left-style: none" class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-smile" alt="Smile" src="/assets/image_285929.jpg" />.</p>
