<p><a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/autocad/adam-nagy.html">Adam</a>&#0160;passed on a request to me from a private email conversation with Owen Wengerd:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&quot;Please tell Stephen Preston that the blog should at least display recent comments on the main page so that readers can easily check for replies to their own comments.&quot;</p>
<p>Consider me told Owen :-). I&#39;ve just added a widget over on the right sash. Its a bit ugly, but we can keep it if it helps. What does everyone think?</p>
