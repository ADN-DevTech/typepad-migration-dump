<p>The DevTech team maintain a simple <a href="http://images.autodesk.com/adsk/files/autocad_2013_dotnet_wizards.zip" target="_self">AutoCAD .NET Wizard</a> for Visual Studio. Its a great learning aid for when we run training classes, its helpful for beginners, and makes it a lot simpler to debug your plug-ins if you&#39;re using Visual Basic/C# Express - but we deliberately keep it simple so we don&#39;t hide how the API works, or tie people in to a specific application architecture when they start programming that will make it hard to develop their own project templates later.</p>
<p>For those of you who yearn for something a little different, our friends over at <a href="www.theswamp.org" target="_blank">TheSwamp</a>&#0160;have just spotted this alternative AutoCAD .NET Wizard - <a href="http://spiderinnet1.typepad.com/blog/2012/04/use-item-wizards-of-autocad-net-addin-wizard-acadnetaddinwizard.html" target="_blank">AcadNetAddinWizard</a>. This is the first time I&#39;ve come across &#39;<a href="http://profile.typepad.com/spiderinnet1" target="_blank">spiderinnet1</a>&#39;, and I&#39;ve not tried this wizard myself - so I can&#39;t vouch for it personally - &#0160;<a href="http://www.theswamp.org/index.php?topic=41470.0" target="_self">but TheSwamp guys seem pretty keen</a>. (As with anything you download from the interweb - use it at your own risk).</p>
<p>We&#39;ll continue to maintain our simple version. Kudos to spiderinnet for sharing this with the community.</p>
<p>And feel free to let us know if you have something posted somewhere that you&#39;d like to share with the Autodesk developer community. Happy to mention it in this blog.</p>
