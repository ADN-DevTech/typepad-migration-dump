  body: 'Dear Martin,


    I am glad to hear that this looks useful to you!


    I am sorry that I cannot publish executable binaries for legal reasons.


    The best would be for you to have someone at hand with some Revit API knowledge
    and a compiler to create an executable for you.


    That would also enable you to modify it, for instance if there are some hard-coded
    paths or something else that does not fit your needs.


    You could always try contacting Trevor and asking him for the .NET assembly DLL.


    Another way would be to convert it to a macro ... you already have the Revit macro
    editor and IDE installed, since it is part of Revit nowadays.


    Good luck!


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: "Hi Jeremy,\n\nIs there a 'WithEvents' or some equivalent for views/sheets?\
    \  I want to build an app to manage view naming transparently. \n\nWhat you describe\
    \ above is part of the puzzle actually : ) defining elevation view tag names on\
    \ the room name/number.\n\nThe app would basically use rule based criteria to\
    \ create names- like \"AFP01\", \"MFP01\" \"SFP01\" etc. instead of \"floor plan\
    \ - level 1\". This becomes helpful with 'sim' callouts to existing views, or\
    \ sections or details.\n\nI was thinking I might replace the buttons for creating\
    \ callouts, plans, etc. on the ribbon with custom versions, but a withevents would\
    \ be better- intercepting created views/sheets immediately prior to creation and\
    \ naming them, then creating them.\n\nThanks-\nRon"

    Sorry, I don''t really know the difference between these kind of objects. I imagine
    that you can easily solve your task by analysing the project using RevitLookup
    and doing some research yourself.


    Cheers, Jeremy.
