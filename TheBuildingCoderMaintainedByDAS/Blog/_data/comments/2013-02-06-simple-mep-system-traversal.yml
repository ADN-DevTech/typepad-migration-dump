  body: "Hi Jeremy,\n\nThanks for your great Blog and posts. I have a lot of \"Unassigned\
    \ Systems\" in a MEP model and was wondering how to filter them? Following code\
    \ gives me only the well assigned systems but not the rest:\nFilteredElementCollector\
    \ collector = new FilteredElementCollector(doc).OfClass(typeof(MechanicalSystem));\
    \ \nor ... ()typeof(MEPSystem));\n\nThe interesting point here is that Revit identifies\
    \ these systems anyways and shows me them in the system browser. So my understanding\
    \ is that there should be another way of filtering to catch these kind of systems.\n\
    \nRegards"

  body: 'Dear Puyan,


    I cannot say off-hand.


    I would suggest exploring the model in depth using RevitLookup or, better still,
    interactive API exploration using the Revit Python or Ruby shell as described
    here:


    <a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2013/11/intimate-revit-database-exploration-with-the-python-shell.html">http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2013/11/intimate-revit-database-exploration-with-the-python-shell.html</a>


    If you simply create a small new model and ensure that such a system exists, it
    should be pretty easy to find in RevitLookup by snooping the database, and that
    will show you how to retrieve it using a fiitered element collector as well.


    Cheers, Jeremy.
