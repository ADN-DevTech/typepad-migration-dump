  body: I have a question about grayed out commands.  I am looking at my first application
    to create a family and was looking at the DWG family creation sample.  This sample
    is set up to check to make sure the active document is a family document.  However,
    when I go into Revit and create a family document, all the external commands are
    grayed out and I can't get to them.  I have tried all modes and none seem to work.  How
    do you run an external command from the family editor?

  body: 'Dear Steve,


    I do nothing special at all to run a command in the family editor. Just create
    a new or open an existing family document and activate the Add-Ins panel. If the
    commands were greyed out, which they never are, I think, I might select some element
    in the current view and then hit escape a few times or something like that.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: 'Nevermind, I should have mentioned that I was trying in 2009.  After more
    investigation I don''t think 2009 is capable of working with family documents,
    correct?  I tried it in 2010 and it works fine...


    thanks,

    Steve'

    Haha, 2009. Never mind indeed. Yes, you should have mentioned that. As you say,
    there is no API support whatsoever in the family editor context in Revit 2009.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: "some facts I found about \"grayed out external commands\" \nin revit 2010,\
    \ the problem occured to me today, i searched half day , I reinstalled Revit 2010,\
    \ (solved temporarily the problem), then it came back after using my commands.\
    \ compared the content of the registry when there was no problem, and when the\
    \ external commands are greyed out. I do debug my dll, then sometimes i force\
    \ quit revit because i found what i was after. The thing is, revit2009 worked\
    \ great with this, but 2010 do not seem to apppreciate those manners.\n\nthe solution\
    \ for me was in the windows registry.\n\nthe \"HKEY_USER .... Software\\Autodesk\\\
    Revit\\Autodesk Revit Architecture 2010\\...\\Repository\\Statistics\\CleanClose\
    \ key\" is greying out the external commands when it's value is different from\
    \ 0xC (mine was 0x5)\nwhen changing it's value you can correct this otherwise\
    \ it seems stuck greyed out forever."

  body: 'Dear Jean-François,


    Thank you very much for this interesting information. Strangely enough, I have
    never run into this problem, even though I do start Revit from the Visual Studio
    debugger all the time, and just stop debugging at any time I like, so Revit almost
    never gets a chance to shut down properly. Still the problem does not occur. But
    it will certainly be extremely useful to have this information provided by you
    if I should run into the problem some day. Thank you!


    Cheers, Jeremy.'
