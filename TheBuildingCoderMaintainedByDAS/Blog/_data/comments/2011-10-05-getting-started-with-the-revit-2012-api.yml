  body: 'Hi,


    Thanks for providing us with this informative blog. I ran into a problem that
    all of the sample projects that I compile for Revit 2012 have their ribbon buttons
    disabled. Building addins for 2011 used to work fine. Does anybody have an idea
    what might be the cause of this problem?


    Thanks in advance.


    Kind regards,

    Thomas'

    Thank you for your appreciation!


    I have not heard of that problem.


    All I know about greyed out command buttons is summarised in

    Sorry, the Revit API is only available within the context of the callbacks that
    it defines, so you must define an add-in implementing an external application
    or command to use it, cf.

    No, sorry, I cannot help you with installation issues. Please ask product support.
    And I would suggest installing the current version, Revit 2014. It offers significant
    improvements in all areas.


    Cheers, Jeremy.
