  body: "Hi Jeremy Tammik,\n\nI have created a Rectangular Concrete Column using Structural\

    \ the width and depth of the column, however, when i load this newly created family\
    \ into a revit project and try to modified the 'b' and 'h' parameter value, the\
    \ size of the column (width and depth) doesn't show any changes, am i missing\
    \ something here?\n\nThe height of the column created is not constrained to the\

  body: 'Dear Bsyap,


    First of all, please build your family manually once via the user interface before
    you try to do it programmatically. Once you have done that, you can examine your
    manually created family using RevitLookup and hopefully answer some of your questions
    yourself.


    Regarding the modification of ''b'' and ''h'', have you applied the AssociateElementParameterToFamilyParameter
    method as demonstrated in lab 3 above?


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    The Family API labs are available for download from the original discussion of
    the Family API at

    Easier still, they are also available directly in this post. Look for the following

    Nope, no idea. This is probably a Windows Monday morning muddle.

  body: 'Dear Mihai,


    I am not surprised at all that you ran into problems trying to manipulate an RFT
    file telling Revit it was am RFA. I am glad you found the reason and solved it.


    The filtered element collector looks OK to me. When I enter a family file, for
    instance by creating a new one from the Metric Column template, and then use RevitLookup
    to explore the reference places, I see them via Add-Ins > Revit Lookup > Snoop
    DB... > ReferencePlane. So I think the filtered element collector should pick
    them up as well.

    Oh wow, yes, you must, that is the very first thing to install before you start
    doing anything else with the Revit API.


    It is by far THE most important exploration tool for Revit development.
