  body: 'Dear Sangsen,


    That sounds interesting. Can you prove that? How?


    The best thing to do would be for you to submit an ADN DevHelp Online case for
    this so that we can examine it in more depth.


    If you are not an ADN member, please send me a minimal reproducible case by email.


    To answer your question: yes, you will probably get optimal performance by converting
    your code to use an external event instead of the Idling one.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: "Dear Sangsen,\n\nGlad to hear that it works fine in release mode.\n\nI do\
    \ not understand at all what problem you are having in debug mode.\n\nI checked\
    \ with the development team, and we are not aware of Idling being slower.\n\n\
    The older non-default mode should be virtually the same as before. \n\nThe new\
    \ mode will naturally be slower, because it will respond to real idling (system\
    \ Idling) event, which is not always triggered even when the end user is seemingly\
    \ not doing anything. Therefore, the MultiThreading/WorkThread work-thread analysis\
    \ SDK sample uses the old Idling mode.\n\nThe original internal implementation\
    \ has stayed virtually untouched.\n\nNow, when you say 'taking more time', does\
    \ that mean it is not triggered as often, correct? Or is it something else?\n\n\
    Also, when you ask me for help, what on earth would you like me to do? \n\nI can\
    \ pray for you, but I cannot change the internal implementation of Revit  :-)\n\
    \nMaybe you are just observing some side effects of your debugging process, which\
    \ ave nothing to do with Revit at all...\n\nCheers, Jeremy."

    \ think is happening and I don't understand way, maybe you can help me.\n\nWhat\
    \ I'm doing is, from inside the idle event I duplicate a symbol and then I use\
    \ it to create a instance of it, everything works, there is no error, no exception,\
    \ but when I check the result in Revit I see that the instance, witch is a MEP\
    \ family, doesn't have the connector. \n\nI did a debug on the code and I discover\
    \ that the instance that is created have a null MEPModel.ConnectorManager.\n\n\
    This means that the Duplicate method is not working correctly during idle event\
    \ or I am doing something wrong?\n\nIf I do the same thing in a command then the\
    \ connector is there.\n\nThank you."

  body: 'Dear Christian,


    Nope, sorry, I do not know what might be going wrong.


    If it works manually, performing the exact same step programmatically should work.


    Have you tried minimalising your code even further still, to ensure that you are
    not inadvertently toggling some option that requires access to the server?


    Maybe eliminate all option settings except the DetachFromCentralOption one?


    Is the model path independent of central?


    All I know is this, which seems to indicate that it should work:
