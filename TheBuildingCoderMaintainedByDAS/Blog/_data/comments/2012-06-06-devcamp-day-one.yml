    Congratulation with successful finishing of the first day. Hope it was interesting.

    You used my sample. This is cool:)

    It is a pity that I did not have time to finish my ExStroage extension. I think
    you could tell about it in your class.'

  body: 'Dear Veli,


    As far as I know, you can duplicate materials. There are several examples of creating
    new materials from scratch. You can also use the copy and paste API to reproduce
    existing ones. You can access their assets, so presumably those can be copied
    as well. Here is a list of absolutely everything I know about material handling:


    5.5. Material Management and Libraries


    <a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/about-the-author.html#5.5">http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/about-the-author.html#5.5</a>


    5.42. Texture Bitmap and UV Coordinate Access


    <a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/about-the-author.html#5.42">http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/about-the-author.html#5.42</a>


    Or, in other words, I know absolutely nothing, my memory being what it is, but
    I tried to take note and publish it all before forgetting  :-)


    Cheers, Jeremy.
