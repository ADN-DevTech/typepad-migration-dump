    No, sorry, none whatsoever. Do you feel a need for such a diagram? I personally
    do not. It would have to be huge! My walls are all too small! I find the real-time
    analysis and navigation built in to Visual Studio much more efficient. I never
    did understand the people that wanted these things.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: 'I''m trying to print this into a 24x36 so I can actually see what it says.
    when I click on the link "Revit API Class Diagram.png" it doesn''t work.


    Is there a way I can find the one that you can zoom into so I can read it?


    Any help on this would be great :)

    sincerely,
