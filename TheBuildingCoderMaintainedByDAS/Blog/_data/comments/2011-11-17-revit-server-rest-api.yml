  body: "Hi Jeremy, \nI've got an AU Virtual class on this topic this year that people\
    \ might like to check out as an intro:\n<a href=\"http://blog.rodhowarth.com/2011/09/revit-autodesk-university-2011-virtual.html\"\
    >http://blog.rodhowarth.com/2011/09/revit-autodesk-university-2011-virtual.html</a>\
    \ \n\nI've also done a few blog posts relating to Revit Server and the various\
    \ API's surrounding it:\nHow to get a listing of all projects through the Revit\
    \ Server API\n<a href=\"http://blog.rodhowarth.com/2011/09/revit-server-how-to-get-listing-of-all.html\"\
    >http://blog.rodhowarth.com/2011/09/revit-server-how-to-get-listing-of-all.html</a>\n\
    \nReplacing the Silverlight admin tool with a HTML/Javascript version powered\
    \ via the API\n<a href=\"http://blog.rodhowarth.com/2011/10/revit-html-version-of-silverlight-revit.html\"\
    >http://blog.rodhowarth.com/2011/10/revit-html-version-of-silverlight-revit.html</a>\n\
    \nand finally Revit Remote Boot, which is a way I've combined some of the Revit/Revit\
    \ Server API's to enable you to open a Revit server model and run some API code\
    \ on it from a batch file\n<a href=\"http://blog.rodhowarth.com/2011/11/at-last-years-autodesk-university.html\"\

  body: 'Dear Rod,


    Thank you very much for pointing these out!


    Wow! I''m wondering whether these pointers would not be worth promoting to a main
    blog post in itself?


    Hope they get the attention they deserve, and looking forward to seeing you at
    AU!


    Cheers, Jeremy.
