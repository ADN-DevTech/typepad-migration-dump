  body: "Hi,\n\nI am trying to create a new sheet, but having problem to get the ElementID.\
    \ You are using: ViewSheet.Create( doc, typ.Id );\nwhere typ.Id itself is coming\
    \ from the following hard-coded line:\n\nFamilySymbol typ = doc.GetElement(\n\
    \      new ElementId( 143899 ) ) as FamilySymbol;\n\n\nCan you please help me\
    \ to find out where should I get the elementID from?\n\nThanks."

    I really cannot tell. I have not dived deep into Dynamo myself. Please check in
    the forums dedicated to that topic. Thank you!
