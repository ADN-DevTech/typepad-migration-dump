  body: "Hi Jeremy,\n\nI have downloaded and installed the Revit 2015 add-in wizard\
    \ through which I aim to build a command found in your AdnRme Revit MEP 2015.\
    \ (Right-clicking on the project and adding an existing item) The command is 'CmdAssignFlowToTerminals'.\
    \ My problem is I get around 25 build errors once I bring the command in.\n\n\
    The errors include, \n1) The name 'Util' does not exist in the current context\n\
    2) The name 'Const' does not exist in the current context\n3) The type or namespace\
    \ name 'WaitCursor' could not be found (are you missing a using directive or an\
    \ assembly reference?)\n4) The type or namespace name 'ProgressForm' could not\
    \ be found (are you missing a using directive or an assembly reference?)\n\nI\
    \ understand there are certain procedures one must do when migrating the AdnRme\
    \ code, but I am not really sure what those are. Any advice or help would be greatly\

  body: 'Dear Sead,


    It is nice to hear that you are using the add-in wizard and that it is successfully
    completing the task that you ask it to perform.


    Unfortunately, however, your query reveals a complete misunderstanding.


    The add-in wizard generates a completely new project from scratch.


    The AdnRme sample discussed above is an entire finished project.


    You can download it from GitHub and compile it right away.


    In this case, you have no need whatsoever of the wizard.


    There is no need to generate any new commands, they have all been defined already.


    The Util and WaitCursor classes are all already defined and included in the existing
    AdnRme project.


    Just clone it from GitHub and compile right away, in one single click.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    Thank you for your prompt response. After I clone the AdnRme to desktop, you say
    all I have to do is compile the project in one click.

    In my visual studio when I go to debug the and build the project it says that
    the target assembly is missing...when I point the output file to the location
    of the exe/dll it then says that the access to the file is denied. Any suggestions?'

    No, no idea how that might happen. I would suggest working on drive C: only and
    running Visual Studio in Administrator mode. I have never heard of or encountered
    any such problems.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: 'Hi Jeremy,


    Apologies for my rather frustrating posts..


    Ok so I''ve managed to solve that problem by changing the debug setting to release
    and then back to debug. Not sure why that happened. Now moving on, as I debug,
    I get 1 error message:


    "The name ''n2'' does not exist in the current context"


    Any ideas.


    The line of code for that error is as follow...


    Debug.Assert( n2 == n4, "expected to reproduce same result" );'

    Not sure what the above error message could be referring to then.

  body: "Hello again Jeremy,\n\nWas just wondering have you considered releasing a\
    \ Metric version of the AdnRme addin for Revit? or at least for the HVAC portion\
    \ of it. \n\nConverting project units in Revit doesn't really do the job for this,\
    \ as the code is aimed at imperial conversion factors and rounding.\n\nRegards,"

    No, absolutely not.


    Please understand that this is a learning example.


    Converting it to metric is a trivial exercise.


    Please feel free to do so and share the result, if you think it might be useful
    for others as well.


    Thank you!


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    I understand and I do plan on sharing the converted add in as it perhaps might
    be of more value to users from different regions. I do appreciate all your support
    so far and keep up the outstanding work.

    Before you do anything else whatsoever, and before I answer a single further question
    of yours, please work through the getting Revit API started material:


    <a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/about-the-author.html#2">http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/about-the-author.html#2</a>


    That will answer all those questions.


    Have fun!
