    First, thanks a lot for these informations!


    Then, is there another GUID after an installation of RAC 2012 SP1 and where it
    can be found an official list ?


    Thanks in advance'

  body: 'Dear Gab,


    You can use the algorithms described above to find out for yourself.


    You can use also look in the Windows registry path listed above to find out for
    yourself.


    For safety''s sake, I checked for you, and on my machine I do not see any updated
    GUIDs for the SP. They SP2 seems to be using the same GUID as the original installation.


    Cheers, Jeremy.
