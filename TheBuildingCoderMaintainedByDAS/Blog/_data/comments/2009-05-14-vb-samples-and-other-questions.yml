    I don''t have the handy code using SQL Several provider to read an Excel file.


    I will pay attention to reading that. While you might find other code in internet
    to read excel file using SQL Server provider.


    Cheers,

    Congratulations on solving the issue. Is the solution in any way specific to the
    Revit API? If so, it might be interesting to publish it for others to make use
    of as well. Although it sounds to me as if it does not in fact have all that much
    to do with Revit?


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    Actually, this solution is not specific to the Revit API. The problem is, in 64
    bits environment the OleDBJet is not running. So, no way to open a connection
    with a Database like Access, Excel. I did not find a simple way to open with SqlServer,
    so, I''ve resolved the problem with opening a CSV file with StremHeader. The function
    I made is a simple function wich fill a Revit schedule and create non placed rooms
    with a specific column. you can see a sample of it here : <a href="http://www.steekr.com/n/50-17/share/LNK808149057ab0f2411/">http://www.steekr.com/n/50-17/share/LNK808149057ab0f2411/</a>


    Concerning your last sentence, I did not understand it....

    I hope your use of VBA was actually appropriate and not really excessive  :-)  ...
    maybe extensive, as well.


    The scripting language for Revit is anything that supports the .NET framework.
    Prime examples of this are C#.NET, VB.NET, and managed C++. The same applies for
    AutoCAD.NET programming. As Kean Walmsley demonstrates in various posts for AutoCAD,
    there are a many other languages that can also be used, such as Boo, F#, Python,
    and Ruby. Some of these could be used for Revit scripting as well. As discussed
    in previous posts, it is possible to use the .NET functionality to combine and
    translate between different languages:

    VB.NET is a different language from VBA, although there are many similarities.
    Personally, I prefer C# over VB, but that is a question of taste.


    I hope this helps.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: 'Hi Jeremy,


    I want to implement importexport SDK sample in the closing event of REVIT Document.
    For instance I can use it as an ExternalCommand of course.

    But if I try to call the mainform of importexport SDK in DocumentClosing event
    I see that

    The constructor of Maindata need commandData argument as an ExternalCommandata.
    In the context of DocumentClosing EVENT I don''t known how to get this argument.

    Have you a solution or a runaround.

    I use revit 2014.

    Thanks'

  body: 'Dear Daniel,


    The ExternalCommandData argument is only available in the Execute event handler
    of an external command and nowhere else.


    If you look at the ImportExport implementation, you will probably note that you
    do not need all of the ExternalCommandData information anyway.


    You should be able to get everything you need from the current document itself,
    and that is provided as an argument to the DocumentClosing event handler.


    Cheers, Jeremy.
