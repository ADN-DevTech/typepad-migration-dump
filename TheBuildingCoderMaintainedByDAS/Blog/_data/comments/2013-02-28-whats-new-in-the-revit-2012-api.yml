    The next place I would suggest looking is at the routing preferences:


    <a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?q=revit+api+routing+preferences">http://lmgtfy.com/?q=revit+api+routing+preferences</a>


    Do they cover conduits as well?


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    but I am unable to add and retrieve conduit sizes.


    In user Interface we can add Conduits size by selecting Manage > MEP Settings
    > Electrical Settings > Conduit Setting> Sizes.


    Actually I want to add and retrieve conduit size programmatically.

    Thank you for your clarification.


    I discussed this issue with the development team, and there seems to be no access
    to this functionality right now. Sorry about that.


    I raised a wish list item for you, REVIT-20769 [As an external developer, I need
    to read Conduit and Cable Tray Size settings, so I can use them in my add-ins],
    as this issue requires exploration and possibly a modification to our software.
    Please make a note of this number for future reference.


    Thank you for your understanding and patience.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'
