    1.How can i manipulate the tangents of a Hermite spline using API? The constructor
    only take control points in, I can''t find a way to manipulate the tangents, while
    I can access the read only property "Tangents".


    2.How can I construct a curve to represent "parabolic catenary"?'

  body: 'Dear Zhu XiaoMeng,


    Maybe the answer to both your questions is: use nurbs instead.


    I believe that a nurb spline is more powerful than the Hermite and is able to
    represent a catenary curve as well.


    Regarding the "parabolic catenary", that sounds rather strange. As stated in Wikipedia,
    the catenary is mathematically quite different from the parabola:


    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catenary">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catenary</a>


    I do see a mention of the term "parabolic catenary" in


    <a href="http://www.2dcurves.com/exponential/exponentialhc.html">http://www.2dcurves.com/exponential/exponentialhc.html</a>


    As far as I can tell, a so-called "parabolic catenary" means exactly the same
    thing as "catenary".


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    I really appreciate the things you provided especially the Wikipedia link.

    I''m now taking your advice and working on how to use nurbs instead. Oh, GOD,
    it''s really a hard work...

    I''ll come back for more helps!'

    I have problem while debugging. I''m using Visual C# 2010 Express with Revit Architecture
    2011. I managed to do a debuging only at main class. But when it called other
    class, it ignore all the breakpoints. It seem that the application doesnt work
    properly. I already followed all the tips and trick that u mentioned in your blog.


    Thanks a lot for your attention.

    I am still using Visual Studio 2008 myself, so I cannot offer any first-hand advice.
    All I can point at is the information that you have probably already seen in

    Revit add-in projects for Visual Studio 2010 are provided in the following discussions:

    You might be able to install and test those projects on your system and see whether
    they work for you, then analyse the difference to your solution which does not
    work properly.

    the approach you describe here, it was possible under Express 2008, so Microsoft
    may have took that away from us... Obviously debugging without breakpoints presents
    very little interest :(
