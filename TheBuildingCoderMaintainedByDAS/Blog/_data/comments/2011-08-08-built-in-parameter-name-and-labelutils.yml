  body: Jeremy, your blog is awesome.  I had exactly the same question as this poster
    and your answer of “GetLabelFor” was spot on what I needed.  Thank you very much
    for producing such a wonderful Revit API resource.

  body: 'Dear Anatoly,


    Thank you for your interesting question and suggestion.


    Sorry I took so long to respond, I have a large backlog of cases and comments
    and stuff.


    The only thing I can think of to simplify and simultaneously complexify it would
    be to apply pattern matching between the parameter name and the enumeration names.


    For instance, you could split the parameter name on white space and search for
    an enumeration name that contains all of the fragments.


    That would be a pretty reliable way to ensure they match, wouldn''t it?


    And fun and elegant too, I think.


    That might even be worth a blog post on its own, I think.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    Thank you for your appreciation. I''ll pass it on to Joe as well. I am very glad

    Yes, the whole stair implementation was substantially updated in Revit 2013:
