    ¿Que tal?


    As far as I know, you can close all views except the very last active one using
    the Document.Close method.


    If worst comes to worst, you can even force Revit to close the last document as
    well, although that is a very risky undertaking and not recommended for production
    use:

    I hope this helps.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    Hmm, no, there is not much I can do based on that information.


    I would suggest taking a look in the debugger and seeing what is going on.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: 'Dear Celticblue,

    Yesterday I came across the same problem.

    I found out that if the linked DWG file has been linked to the current view only,
    you don''t have Access to the elements.

    If you link the DWG without "current view only" the code works fine.


    Cheers,

    Matthias
