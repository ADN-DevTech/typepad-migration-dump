  body: 'Hi Jeremy,


    this workaround may be adjusted for hosted elements.

    Moving windows or doors may cause errors if the translation is too large (element
    would leave its host''s boundaries) or if the moving direction is locked for the
    element. For example, windows cannot be moved into the Wall.Orientation direction.

    For windows, XYZ.BasisX may be replaced by XYZ.BasisZ.Multiply(tinyAmount).'

    Thank you very much for that very valid comment! So important that I added it
    above as well, to ensure it is not missed, in case of just reading the main section
    and skipping the comments.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    additionally, if the element is a rooflight, the moving vector is depending on
    the roof''s normal vector.

    Moreover, thinking of a window hosted in a FaceWall which can be bent in two directions.

    There would be a different moving vector for each possible LocationPoint. After
    you have moved the Element from A to B using a vector that is valid for moving
    from point A, just this vector, negated, may be inappropriate for moving the element
    back from B to A because it is not a valid moving vector regarding point B.

    Hope I expressed it the right way.'

    Sure, I see what you mean.


    Considering the complexities of moving hosted elements along curved surfaces,
    it might be worth while checking whether some other element modification may be
    easier to accomplish, if this functionality is important to you. Maybe something
    like temporarily changing the type might also work.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    This is off what is being discussed but i need help with this. I am created a
    navisworks plugin which will enable me connect to a web interface and get some
    data. The problem is that the plugin will not load into navisworks. How do i find
    my way around this?'

    Sorry, I have no idea about Navisworks at all. Please submit a case through the
    Autodesk Developer Network ADN DevHelp Online, if you are a member, or try one
    of the Autodesk discussion groups or some other peer forum if not:
