  body: "Hi Jeremy..\n\n  1. In Revit 2013, \n       Create floor and apply hosted\
    \ areaload.Set floor alignment as Bottom of slab and force value as Fz = -1.00.\
    \ Hosted areaload direction changed to (bottom to top). The direction is only\
    \ for bottom alignment.\n\n I think in revit 2012, it works fine for any alignment\
    \ and for -1.00 force value.\n Please confirm me ..this is a Revit bug or not?\n\
    \n 2. Please explain about Revit coordinate system and explain how to convert\
    \ any point into other coordinate system.\n\n\nThanks"

  body: Hi. If you apply area reinforcement, the boundary can't be turned off. In
    2012 it works fine. In 2013, the path reinforcement boundary works fine. Is this
    a bug, or am I missing something
