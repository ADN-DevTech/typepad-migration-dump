  body: 'Hi Jeremy,


    as we can see, the 2013 constructor needs a viewFamilyTypeId.

    There is a ViewFamilyType.DefaultTemplateId, so perhaps we can get a proper "Section"
    Symbol by this method instead of finding it by name.


    This would be more reliable, I think.

    Could you check this out ?


    Cheers,

    Rudolf'

  body: 'Hi Leo,


    what can we see in the picture ?

    It seems that we are in a section view itself and see the section line of another
    section view.


    In fact, we see the *viewer* of the other section view.

    Every time you generate a new view section, there will appear new viewer representations
    in your existing views, so you need to hide them by category.

    Something like:

    viewSection.setVisibility(BuiltInCategory.OST_Viewers), false);

  body: 'Hi Leo,


    you can hide elements in different ways.

    As I said before, you can hide elements by category.

    In your case, just use RevitLookup to determine the Category of the element you
    want to disappear.

    As you will see, reference lines have the Category "OST_ReferenceLines", so try
    this:


    viewSection.setVisibility(BuiltInCategory.ReferenceLines), false);


    And so on.


    Of course you also can hide/unhide *single* Elements. In this case, just use viewSection.HideElements(elementIdList).


    Bye,

    Rudolf'

  body: 'Hi Leo again,


    so just identify the category of the element you want to hide, using RevitLookup.


    It may be that you confuse ReferenceLines with ReferencePlanes, whose twodimensional
    representations may appear as lines although they are planes, depending on the
    view.


    Hope that helps.

    Yes, sure, the new view API certainly provides more control than ever before.


    Here is a new post discussing some aspects of this:

    Does that answer your question?
