    Do you know if there is a way to find out via the API whether the ''Display the
    contextual tab on selection'' option is checked or not?


    Best regards

  body: 'Dear Simon,


    Thank you for checking. Nope, sorry, not that I am aware of. I filed a request
    for you: SPR #234101 [API wish: check for ''Display the contextual tab on selection''
    option].


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    Thank you for your appreciation.


    It is always safer to submit a case to ADN. That guarantees you an answer and
    makes it official.


    By posting a comment to the blog, you throw yourself at my whim and mercy. Also,
    I may simply be away, or occupied, or dead.


    Submitting an ADN case should be no more effort, really. Sorry if you find that,
    and hope you can find a way to optimise it for yourself.


    Cheers, Jeremy.
