  body: 'Hi Jeremy,

    I urgently need your help, I managed to get my ACA 2011 working with VS 2010 Express
    (thanks to your valuable posts), and started working on ACA.NET after watching
    your 2 last web-casts. I am facing a problem with the Graph class when running
    AecWallSystemSampleMgd (see code below)


    Manager mgr = new Manager(db);

    Graph theGraph = mgr.FindGraph(wall);


    I am always getting null value for theGraph object, when I debug the mgr.GraphCount
    is always 0.


    I need the Joints,Sections and Connections to develop automatic details generation
    of ICF system.


    Any help in this regard will be highly appreciated and also if you have any resource
    regarding ICF wall system in ACA would be very helpful'

  body: 'Hi Jeremy,


    The issue of intersecting walls is problematic.  The trick would be to insert
    a pre-processing step to identify intersecting walls and split the secondary wall
    (if it can be identified) into two walls--it makes sense to do so from a construction
    standpoint although from a drafting standpoint, it makes things more cumbersome
    since you now have to drag multiple walls instead of one when adjusting the design.'

  body: "Dear Chuck,\n\nYes, sounds feasible to me. Also, please note that in Revit\
    \ 2012, you have the option to allow and disallow wall end joins. \n\n\"The new\
    \ WallUtils class methods DisallowWallJoinAtEnd, AllowWallJoinAtEnd and IsWallJoinAllowedAtEnd\
    \ provide access to the setting for whether or not joining is allowed at a particular\
    \ end of the wall. If joins exist at the end of a wall and joins are disallowed,\
    \ the walls will become disjoint. If joins are disallowed for the end of the wall,\
    \ and then the setting is toggled to allow the joins, the wall will automatically\
    \ join to its neighbors if there are any.\"\n\nCheers, Jeremy."

  body: FYI, I've come across a couple of examples where walls are joined at a T,
    if I select one of the walls, neighbors.count is 2 (if I delete the wall that
    is reported as joined, neighbors.count is still 2, so the regenerated wall graph
    thinks the remaining wall is joined to the selected wall).  Unfortunately, I can't
    show you the file as it is proprietary :-(  Have you come across this situation?

  body: 'Dear Chuck,


    The ElementsAtJoin method will only report neighbours at the end points of the
    wall location curve; the Revit API help file states:


    "Get all elements joining to the end of this element''s location curve or change
    the order of elements participation in the end join with this location curve''s
    end."


    Therefore, if walls join in a T shape, the wall connecting at the midpoint will
    never be reported by this method.


    To detect neighbour walls which do not connect at the endpoint of the location
    curve, you can use an intersection filter, e.g. as shown by the Geometry2012 sample
    demonstrating the new Boolean operations available in the Revit 2012 API and presented
    at the last DevDays conferences:
