    in fact, the text does not give an answer how to display a single *point* at all.


    What I mean is that there is no AcDbPoint3d equivalent in the Revit world, and
    it cannot be workarounded by drawing ModelCurves since there is a minimum length
    for creating them.


    As far as I know, even using the AVF, you cannot draw single points. But even
    if that is possible:


    For debugging purposes, it would be useful to have a selectable object, but since
    AVF objects are not selectable (excepting the legend, I think), you could not
    check any XYZ values using RevitLookup, for example.



    Cheers,

    Rudolf'

    Right, I should have said marker, not point.


    You could use AVF and a self-defined font to draw the XYZ information  :-)


    Or you could use my self-defined tooltip to display it:
