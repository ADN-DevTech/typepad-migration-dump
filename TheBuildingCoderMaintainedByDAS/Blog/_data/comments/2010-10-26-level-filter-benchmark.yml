  body: "Hi Jeremy, \n\nI'm using Revit 2013. I can't get the family instance from\
    \ a specific level (example Level 2) by using your code. As in Revit 2013, I'm\
    \ using View to get the level. But if the view is not the active view, I can't\
    \ get information about family instance. Can you help me on that? \n\nThanks."

  body: "Dear Tshau,\n\nIt is easy to select all family instances on a level, and\
    \ there are lots of samples here on the blog showing how to do that. Look a bit\
    \ harder, please. \n\nActually, you can also look in the Revit API help file RevitAPI.chm\
    \ and at the description and sample code provided for the ElementLevelFilter class.\n\
    \nCheers, Jeremy.\n-----"
