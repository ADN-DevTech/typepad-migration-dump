  body: "Hi Jeremy,\n\nthank you for posting this solution! \nI tried another approach,\
    \ which also seems to work. I accessed the Instance Geometry of the Geometry Element.\
    \ Is there any difference between Symbol Geometry + Transform and Instance Geometry?\n\
    \n\n Autodesk.Revit.Geometry.Element geoElement = geoInst.GetInstanceGeometry();\n\
    \n                        GeometryObjectArray geoInstObjectArray = geoElement.Objects;\n\
    \n\nCheers, Christian"

    Is it possible to get the actual storage size of any Revit element as it is sized
    in its Revit file?'

  body: "Dear Jeff,\n\nI am not aware of any such possibility. I would also assume\
    \ that the storage size depends on a huge number of factors. If there is some\
    \ specific element that you are interested in, I would try the following:\n\n\
    1. Create an empty project and save it in a file A. \n\n2. Create a certain number\
    \ N elements of the type you are interested in, preferrably at least a couple\
    \ of thousand, and save that in a file B.\n\n3. Calculate the file size used per\
    \ element as (size B -  size A) / N.\n\nCheers, Jeremy."

    \ have a function that when loading a project one could optionally parse each\
    \ element size when it is not yet in its runtime loaded state. \n\nJeff"

    What an unusual request. What do you need this for, please?

    Seems like a very strange thought to me. Sorry, I cannot suggest anything beyond
    what I said above.

    is that possible to get stair vertics to make reinforcement plugin for it ?'

  body: 'Dear Basel,


    You can easily find out for yourself. Simply select a stair object and use RevitLookup
    to snoop the current selection. If you can read the stair geometry and access
    its solid, you can get the vertices from there.

    I followed the above code and was able to retrieve the nested geometry solid.
    Any chance you could post a few pointers how you''d go about transforming the
    solid to the instance coordinate system?'

    I used the <i>getTransform</i> method

    answer was staring me right in the face the whole time!'
