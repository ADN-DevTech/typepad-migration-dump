  body: 'Yeah good info, but please tell me HOW TO use reflector.  I ran my exe and
    I get little box with no way to do anything.  It does provide me with nice but
    ugly unsolvable errors that say "The remote name could not be resolved: ''reflector.re-gate.com''".  I''m
    not trying to go anywhere remote.  The app is local.  Do I access it through Visual
    Studio?'

  body: 'Hi Jeremy,


    there is another good tool, http://www.icsharpcode.net/OpenSource/SD/

    a open source ide for .Net. This also can convert from c# to vb.

    And it supports debugging of assemblies like the one for Revit, when you have
    to start an external program. The express editions from visual studio can do this
    out of the box.


    Cheers,

    Tim'

  body: 'Hi Tim,


    Thank you for the valuable pointer. Do you actually mean "cannot do this out of
    the box"? However, there is a trick to debug in the express addition as well,
    some small twist in the xml project file, I think, documented in Kean''s blog,
    I think, isn''t there?


    Cheers, Jeremy'

    I simply start up Reflector, for instance by typing C:\bin\reflector.exe on the
    command line, and then open an assembly file by selecting File > Open.

    I followed this guide <a href="http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/index?siteID=123112&id=20132893">http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/index?siteID=123112&id=20132893</a>
    to debug in express.


    btw, reflector is now owned by redgate. Are you still using Lutz version or  the
    redgate version?


    regards, Rey'

    Thank you for a relevant question.


    I use very little commercial software, actually, but in this case I did go and
    get the updated version.


    I am currently using .NET Reflector 6.


    Cheers, Jeremy.
