  body: 'Hi Berria,


    I am really quite surprised by your question. Surely you have seen some of the
    examples of iterating over collections in the labs? Simply search for the string
    GetAllFamilySymbols throughout the labs and see how the results are iterated there.
    One prime example is in Lab3_3_DetermineInstanceTypeAndFamily.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: 'Hi Jeremy,


    First, thanks for the amazing work here on your blog. It''s a valuable information
    source for people working with Revit API. It already saved me some good hours
    of work!


    I have a fairly simple question:


    I want to get start and end XYZ points for beams and columns. Beams and slanted
    columns are easy, as they have a LocationCurve where I can use get_EndPoint(1).
    But for regular columns, I''m subtracting base from top offset to get its length
    and then add it to start''s Y value.


    Is that the most reliable way to do it, or there is a easier way to get endpoint
    from a vertical column?


    Thanks,

    Rafael'

    Thank you for your appreciation!


    I have a fairly complex answer  :-)


    If it is a structural column, you could access its analytical model. That would
    give you the analytical start and end point.


    You could also query the column geometry and analyse that. You should be able
    to determine the long edges, and you could calculate the average of their start
    and end points, respectively, to obtain your own beam start and end point.


    It depends a bit on how you define start and end point, of course  :-)


    Apart from that, your approach sounds perfectly valid as well.


    Yet another way might be to determine the start point from the location point,
    possibly find the direction vector either from that as well, or from the geometry,
    e.g. the normal vector of the face containing the start point, and then use that
    together with the Length parameter, if it has one, to determine the end point.
    I like that better than what you describe, but I don''t know whether it would
    work. Please test and let me know.


    As you know, there is often more than one way to achieve something:
