  body: 'Hi Jeremy, this is a very interesting post, thanks.

    From this example I assume that the project north is used a reference to find
    the south orientation.

    I was wondering what the impact on this code would be if the project north differs
    from the true north setting? I gues you would need to find the angle between project
    and true north and then correct the results accordingly?

    I would be very interested in seeing how you would handle this.

    Thanks!'

  body: 'Hi Tom,


    Very glad you like it, so did I. And thank you very much for this very relevant
    question. We will be addressing that correction for project north pretty much
    the way you describe in an upcoming post, so please hold on a bit until we get
    around to that. According to my current plan, it is part 8 of the series  :-)


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    I posted the solution for handling the project location and project north rotation:
