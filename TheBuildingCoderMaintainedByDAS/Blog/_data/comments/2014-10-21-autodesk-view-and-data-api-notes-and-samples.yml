  body: "Is there any \"Demo\" webpage to show-off what this View API can do?\n\n\
    Its a pity there are almost zero sample projects in an actually working internet\
    \ environment. I thought by now this would have been set up. Because clearly there\
    \ has been alot of work been put into this...The website <a href=\"https://developer.autodesk.com/\"\
    >https://developer.autodesk.com/</a> simply points to the git hub and but require\
    \ some study to make them work...even images on Autodesk website are not working\
    \ API but simple images. \n\nOur company is investing in new ways of showing our\
    \ Revit models, and I suggested the View API, however since I could not show any\
    \ impressive working model. I cannot convince anyone to invest in this...\n\n\
    Probably not the best place to mention this, but its frustrating every time I\
    \ see View API in the title. Would like to see more demo pages..."

    Sorry to hear that you are not finding the samples you need.


    This is indeed not the perfect place to mention this, but perfectly ok.


    The best place to ask for more appropriate samples is in the dedicated  Autodesk
    View and Data API discussion forum:


    Autodesk Community - Web Services API - View and Data API discussion forum

    I would suggest submitting this comment there as well and see what the team has
    to say.


    I am pretty sure that all you need is already available somewhere.


    If there is anything missing that you need, we will certainly be glad to provide
    it!


    Cheers, Jeremy.'
