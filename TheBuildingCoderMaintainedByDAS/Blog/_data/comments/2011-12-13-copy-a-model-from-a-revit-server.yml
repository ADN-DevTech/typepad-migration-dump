  body: 'Is it possible to do the reverse? For example, could I copy a file from a
    file-share and upload it to Revit Server? Sort of like uploading it, but in a
    programmatic way?


    Feel free to email me if you need to!'

  body: "Hi John,\n\nI asked ADN is very question about a month ago. Here's the answer:\n\
    \nUnfortunately, Revit Server REST API cannot move files between the server and\
    \ the local machine - no download, no upload.\n\nYou can use the Revit API to\
    \ download files, but not to upload.\nThere is also an utility that enables you\
    \ to create local copies: \"<Revit folder>\\Program\\RevitServerToolCommand\\\
    RevitServerTool.exe\"\n \nHowever, programmatically uploading is not yet possible\
    \ way at the moment."

    \ for a client to see if this is possible. Sad that it's not, but not the end\
    \ of the world right now (for me). \n\nHopefully we'll see this functionality\
    \ in the future; would be useful for sure (HINT HINT Autodesk...).\n\nThanks!"
