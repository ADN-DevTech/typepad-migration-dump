    Is there a way to export a revit architecture project to gbxml via revit API ?
    I already manage to do this with Revit MEP. How can i define spaces and zones
    in revit architecture ?


    Best regards.'

  body: 'Dear Hamid,


    As always, you should explore an optimal solution for this through the user interface
    first, before thinking about possibly automating it.


    Are you sure that it is possible at all to create spaces and zones when using
    Revit Architecture?


    Those are non-architectural MEP objects.


    The method to create them programmatically through the API is identical, regardless
    what flavour of Revit you are running in.


    The gbXML export is also identical in all flavours, via Document.Export( string,
    string, MassGBXMLExportOptions ).


    Cheers, Jeremy.
