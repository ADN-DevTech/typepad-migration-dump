  body: 'While the above example extracts the "used" Omni Class numbers from the elements,
    it does not produce the same result as the built in tool. For example, if this
    process is used on a 2009 revit drawing that has been converted to 2010 it will
    find nothing, while for the same drawing, the export utility fills the OmniClassNumbers
    table with all available codes.


    I have asked how the built in tool does that, but have as yet not gotten a response.'

    I see how your code queries the information, but is it possible to write/overwrite
    the Omniclass code and description to a family?'

    As far as I know you can specify any OmniClass code you like when you define your
    own family, so you should have complete control over it at that point.


    Have you looked at the file OmniClassTaxonomy.txt in the Program subdirectory
    of the Revit installation folder?


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: 'Dear Jeremy,


    I''ve looked the OmniClassTaxonomy.txt file in the subdirectory of Revit and I
    have two questions:

    The first, the numerical codes contained in this text file (in the Revit 2011)
    and the official ones (www.omniclass.org) do not match. Do you know why?

    The second one, if you change the values of the codes in this file then the relationship
    will turn into a non standarized one. Am I right?


    Regards, Gons.'

    Nope, I do not know why the codes used by Revit do not match the ones defined
    by www.omniclass.org.


    And yes, I assume you are right, but I am not a product usage expert, so you would
    be better advised to ask someone more knowledgeable than me.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    Revit 2011 seems to use the older OmniClass Table 23 from 28/3/2006, not the updated
    version from 24/6/2010 published on www.omniclass.org.

    Thank you for the pointer to the Revit Genome Project. I cannot say much about
    it, being purely API focused. Looks commendable  :-)
