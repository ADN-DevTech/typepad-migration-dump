    \nI created the Wall with the material structure with Finish1.\n\nPlease teach\
    \ me, how to extract the elements which belongs to OST_WallsFinish1 Category."

  body: 'Dear Kamalanathan,


    As you already heard from Joe Ye on your ADN query 1267461 [Extracting Elements
    belongs to sub category], the OST_WallsFinish1 category does not have any corresponding
    elements in the Revit database. The wall layer Finish1 has this category, however
    there do not exist any corresponding Revit Element derived class instances.


    Since the FilteredElementCollector can only extract instances of classes derived
    from the Element class, there is no access to the wall layer objects you are targeting.


    Cheers, Jeremy.
