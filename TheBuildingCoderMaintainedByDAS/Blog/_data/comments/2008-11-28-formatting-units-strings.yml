    Hm... I am create parameter "Length" type (project unit setup for length "Feet
    and fractional lines" rounding ''to the nearest 1/32" ), and I set random double
    value...

    When I am trying use AsValueString() to retrieve string, data returned correct,
    but only not rounded correctly... like (123'' 3 47/256")

    am I something missing? How to round length or other parameter type data? hope
    for your respond...'

    AsValueString performs the same rounding as Revit does for the user interface.
    What is ''correct'' is a very debatable topic. If you are not happy with the Revit
    formatting, you should not use it. Instead, use AsDouble to retrieve the raw database
    value in the standard database unit and round it and format it any way you please.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: 'Hi Jeremy.

    I have a strange behavior of AsValueString method. All sources and you also wrote,
    that:"AsValueString performs the same rounding as Revit does for the user interface".

    In Revit UI I have several properties:

    Fitting Outside Diameter = 206.4 mm

    Center to End Label = 115.9 mm

    etc.

    But when I try to get values of these parameters through AsValueString it returns
    respectively:

    Fitting Outside Diameter = 206 mm

    Center to End Label = 116 mm

    Do you have any idea what could I miss or do wrong?

    (I''m working with Revit Architecture 2014).


    Thank you,

    Olga'
