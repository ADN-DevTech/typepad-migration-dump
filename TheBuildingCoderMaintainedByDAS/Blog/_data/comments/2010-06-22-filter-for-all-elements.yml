  body: 'Hi Jeremy,


    I have one question for you about manually selecting elements from drawing (windows
    select, user interface side). Why there''s limit of 16383 selection objects? Do
    you have any ideas regarding this one?


    Cheers'

    Oh no, are you serious? Progman is an ADN member, as far as I know ... could you
    please submit an ADN case for this, so I have a handle to use to follow it up
    with the development team? Thank you!


    Regarding that number, a short integer has 16  bits. The maximum positive value
    for a signed integer is 2^15 - 1. The number you mention equals 2^14 - 1. Interesting.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    I also came up with number 2^14 when though about it yesterday, which is quite
    strange. I submitted ADN case about this issue, you can find it under Progman
    cases.

  body: 'Hi Jeremy,


    I knew that we can export data from project element using RDBLink. The problem
    is we want to keep all data from different project in one database. Is it any
    other way to do that? Do I need to create API to do that?


    Thank a lot.

    I would not suggest that you create an API, just use the existing one that we
    provide  :-)


    Yes, you can reproduce the RDBLink functionality using the Revit API, and in that
    case you have full control over how the data gets exported, of course.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    Regarding to export data from element to database, why "Export>>ODBC Database"
    and "Revit DB Link" gave a different result?

    When using "Export>>ODBC Database", i got 183 tables. Using "Revit DB Link", i
    got 234 tables.


    Thanks,

    As ar as I know, these two applications have nothing whatsoever to do with each
    other, so they represent the contents of the Revit model in completely different
    individual ways.

  body: 'Hi Jeremy,


    Thanks for all your great posts, this is a fantastic resource.


    I''d appreciate some advice though, how could I filter all elements that have
    been generated from an IFC Import.  The built in paramater IfcGuid will be set
    to a value.  I''ve tried with a filter and rule like this with no luck.

    FilterRule fr = new SharedParameterApplicableRule("IfcGUID");

    ElementParameterFilter filter = new ElementParameterFilter(fr);


    Any help appreciated.  Thanks in advance,

    Jon'

    \nI think you can filter for anything you can access through RevitLookup. \n\n\
    If you see the data identifying the IFC imported elements there, then you can\
    \ filter for it. \n\nAny further luck so far?\n\nCheers, Jeremy.\n-----"
