  body: 'Dear David,


    I am very glad it is useful to you, and thank you very much for your appreciation.


    I do think that the code should work almost unmodified in Revit 2009 as well,
    actually. The filtering used there was introduced in the Revit 2009 API and remained
    unchanged in Revit 2010.


    Cheers, Jeremy.
