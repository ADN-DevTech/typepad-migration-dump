  body: "Dear Jamie,\n\nI am sorry to say that that the Visual Studio \"Edit and Continue\"\
    \ feature does not work with Revit 2010. Currently, the only known workaround\
    \ is to develop code in VSTA, which offers the ability to modify code interactively\
    \ in the same Revit session. \n\nPersonally, I set up the Visual Studio project\
    \ to start up Revit with a testing project loaded. Then I can hit Alt-D-E in Visual\
    \ Studio to stop debugging, and F5 to start up debugging again, continuing in\
    \ the same project exactly where I left off. That is efficient enough for me.\
    \ Sorry for the bad news.\n\nCheers, Jeremy."

    Do you know if ''Edit and Continue'' will be back in a subsequent release or update?


    thanks

  body: "Dear Ed, \n\nThe development team have looked at the issue very carefully.\
    \ They know what is causing it and how important it is for developers, but it\
    \ would be a lot of work to change it. It is scheduled to be done, but nobody\
    \ can say exactly when the fix will happen.\n\nCheers, Jeremy."

  body: 'Be sure you set your text editor to UTF-8 encoding.  I was using one that
    was set (by default) to UNICODE. Every time I started Revit MEP 2010 the whole
    file would be rebuilt, thus losing paths and other valuable information.


    This took quite a while to figure out.  A warning message from Revit would have
    been MOST helpful.


    Thanks, Jan'

  body: 'Dear Jan,


    Thank you for that hint. I can imagine that that took a while to discover. I myself
    often use the simplest possible, Notepad with an ANSI encoding, and I have not
    had any problems with that.


    Cheers, Jeremy.
