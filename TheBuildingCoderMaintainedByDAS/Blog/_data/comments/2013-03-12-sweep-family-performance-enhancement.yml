    The discussion seems to illustrate the workaround for Revit''s regeneration lag
    but doesn''t answer his initial query.  Can you further explain why his initial
    attempt took so long for Revit to produce?  It seems odd that the same approach
    using Revit and Rhino resulted in about 2 days time difference!  I too want to
    know how to avoid forced/automatic regenerations if possible.


    Thanks,

    Joe'

    Thank you very much for catching this.


    Yes, you are absolutely right, and this "stray regeneration happening in sweep
    creation" definitely needs to be hunted down and removed.


    I am putting together a reproducible case based on the original slow solution
    to submit a case to the development team.


    Cheers, Jeremy.
