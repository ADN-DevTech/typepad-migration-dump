  body: 'Hi Jeremy,


    Is it possible to change project information id?

    How Revit generate this id?

    Is it possible that Revit generate the same id to different project?


    Thank you,


    abidrahmat'

    What exactly is the ''project information id'' for you?


    There is no mention of any such thing in the Revit API help file or developer
    guide.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: 'Hi Jeremy,

    Sorry for not being detailed.

    In Revit, each element has ID including ProjectInformation table (I got it after
    export into database). The ProjectInformation shall keep ProjectIssueDate, ProjectStatus,
    ClientName, ProjectAddress, ProjectName, ProjectNumber, DocumentGUID value.

    I read in the Revit''s forum; it said that there are possibility that another
    element in a different model may have element with the same id.

    My application need to store a few model in one database and the id should be
    unique.

    In that forum, it did mention about "unique id".

    Do I need to add one more parameter in model to keep unique id? Or I can simply
    change the element id?'

    \ used to store an identifier in an external database and to retrieve the exact\
    \ same element in the future if it still exists. This id can be passed the to\
