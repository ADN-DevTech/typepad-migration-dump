    I am able to rotate Family in different Mech(Ex. East,West,North,South Mech) programmatically
    but for this i have create separate  Method to calculate Rotation angle and axis
    for each Mech.



    Is there any common method or property to find Rotation angle and axis which will
    work on all Mech .


    Thanks & Regards

    Namit Jain'

    What a strange word you are using, ''Mech''... what does that mean?


    Anyway, I do not think the Revit API provides such a method directly, but you
    can certainly create one yourself using the methods provided by the Transform
    class.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'
