  body: "Dear Malcolm,\n\nThe thickness of a wall is determined by its type. To change\
    \ between different thicknesses, you need to switch wall type using the Wall.WallType\
    \ property. To define a type with a new wall thickness, you can duplicate and\
    \ modify an existing type. This is demonstrated in \n\n<a href=\"http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2008/11/creating-a-new-family-symbol.html\"\

  body: 'Jeremy,


    Thanks for your informative blog.


    I''ve been trying a few ways to create walls that have faces that are tapered,
    not just profile edges as shown in this example. As you probably know, your example
    will not work if you specify differing Y values for the profile curves (at least
    I haven''t been successful). Is there currently a way to do this in the API? So
    far in my examination of the API, the best I can hope for is to create a geometric
    Form with tapered faces (using the API) and then in Revit (not the API) use the
    massing tools to create a wall from a mass face.


    Do you have any thoughts or suggestions on this matter?


    Thanks for your time,


    Deric'

  body: 'Dear Deric,


    Thank you for your appreciation and your interesting query. Tapered which way,
    I wonder? Do you mean that the wall profile in plan view is tapered, or the wall
    cross section, i.e. in a section view perpendicular to the wall location line?


    Next question: can you create the kind of wall you require through the user interface?
    If not, it almost certainly cannot be done through the API either. If so, could
    you please briefly describe how? Thank you!


    I saw a case about creating a stone wall that tapers as it ascends, i.e. reduces
    in thickness. To create such a battered wall through the user interface, one can
    use the in-place family tools and make an extrusion or sweep. In another case,
    I saw mention of using the vertical compound wall system, and specifically top
    and bottom extensions.


    In Revit 2010, we have the new family API which offers a lot of possibilities
    for standard families, but unfortunately it does not cover in-place families,
    nor system ones such as walls.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: 'Hi Jeremy,


    Thank you for your response. My apologies if I wasn''t clear regarding the taper
    direction. I am referring to a taper in cross section. Here is a link to a simple
    example of what I am trying to achieve:


    <a href="http://www.dericwallace.com/tapered_wall.jpg">http://www.dericwallace.com/tapered_wall.jpg</a>


    The way that it is done through the user interface is to first create a mass that
    has a taper in cross section. Then, using the Wall By Face command in the Massing
    tools, I select the desired wall type in the selector, then I click on the tapered
    face.


    I have examined the possiblity of creating a wall via the API and getting the
    top edge and moving it in the XY plane but the method "MoveSubElement" only applies
    to Form objects. This leads me to believe that I will not be able to fully achieve
    what I would like using the API only. Instead I would have to use the API to create
    these tapered masses then apply a wall to a face using the user interface.


    I think using an in-place wall family for this is not desirable as I would not
    be able to get the wall layers as you can see in the above link. As you have said,
    in-place families are not covered in the API.


    Thanks again,


    Deric'

    Thank you for the sample image, it helps a lot to explain. I would actually not

    of being vertical. I am checking with my colleagues about this and will get back
    to you when I have some news.

  body: 'Dear Mike,


    You can explore this as follows:


    Create a new wall and look at its parameters, e.g. using the Revit API Introduction
    labs built-in parameter checker. One of the parameters is


    WALL_KEY_REF_PARAM ''Location Line'' Integer read-write


    It has an initial value of zero. Looking at the wall properties in the UI, I see
    that the location line property is set to centre line. If I change the property
    to ''Finish Face: Interior'' through the UI and then look at the parameter again,
    its value has now changed to 3.


    You should be able to invert this process, i.e. set the built-in parameter WALL_KEY_REF_PARAM
    to have a value of 3 through the API, and that should correspond to ''Finish Face:
    Interior''.

    You can get lots of X, Y, Z coordinates for stairs and ramps by querying them\
    \ for their geometry. The question is what coordinates exactly are you interested\
    \ in?\n\nNormally, I would suggest querying the ramp for its location as well,\
    \ but I do not see that property properly exposed on the ramp object, or at least\
    \ it does not seem to be a LocationPoint or LocationCurve instance, and therefore\
    \ the data is probably inaccessible through the API.\n\nCheers, Jeremy."

  body: 'hi Jeremy,

    i posed an issue on the thread of November 17, 2008 Wall Elevation Profile regarding
    create new wall w/ CurveArray of more than one "loops" (inner loops are edges
    of the window/door opennings), sometimes it won''t generate new wall even though
    temporary model lines generated from CurveArray looks OK.

    i don''t know what exactly causes such issue, sorting of inner loops is my best
    guess, if so, then what is the rule of loops? outer loop in one direction and
    all inner loops in another direction? or how to make CurveArray of wall profile
    correct if inner loops exists?

    my case is simple:

    1) select wall which has window/door(s).

    2) use solid/edge method to get points/lines list (from your sample).

    3) convert to CurveArray.

    4) create new wall w/ opening(s) of window/door(s).

    works great most of time.

    very appreciated for your help!'

  body: 'hi Jeremy,

    even though i''m not quite sure if i''ve already figured out, but seems whenever
    the 1st edge of outer loop is perpendicular to the 1st edge of inner loop, the
    NewWall won’t work for the CurveArray based on outer loop + inner loop(s), after
    i add the following code to “shift” around inner loop(s), then i works, don’t
    know why?

    // v1 - vector of 1st edge of outer loop

    // v2 - vector of 1st edge of inner loop(s)

    // vertices - inner loop

    while (Math.Abs((v1.Angle(v2) * 180 / Math.PI - 90)) < 0.00001)

    {

    vertices.Insert(0, vertices[vertices.Count - 1]);

    vertices.RemoveAt(vertices.Count - 1);

    v2 = vertices[1].Subtract(vertices[0]);

    }'

  body: 'Dear Ning,


    Thank you for this interesting question. I already discussed it with some colleagues,
    and the consensus is that it should probably work. Could you submit a complete
    working Visual Studio solution and the source code that you are using together
    with examples of situations of where it works and does not work? Thank you!


    Cheers, Jeremy.'
