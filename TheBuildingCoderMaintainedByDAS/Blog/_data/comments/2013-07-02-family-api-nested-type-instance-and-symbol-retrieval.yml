  body: 'Hi Jeremy,

    I just posted here and it didn''t seem to complete? Anyway I would like to set
    the grid datum graphics property to <none> OR uncheck the datums at each end whichever
    I can achieve? Is this possible?

    cheers,

    Nik'

    I just see this one single comment of yours here, plus the other one on


    <a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2013/06/family-api-add-in-load-family-and-place-instances.html">http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2013/06/family-api-add-in-load-family-and-place-instances.html</a>


    I don''t know enough about the grid graphics details to answer your question off-hand.


    In general, I would suggest creating the different desired configurations manually
    and comparing them using RevitLookup, BipChecker and more in-depth explorations
    using the Python or Ruby Revit shells.


    That way you can see whether the different settings are reflected in any element
    parameters or properties, and hopefully use those to control them as well.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    I have accessed the nested family symbols from a family instance and I am getting
    types of door, the wall host and no nested door panels. Then I changed the nested
    family to shared and next time I invoke the external command the panels show up
    in the taskdialog as a nested family symbol. Can I get non-shared nested fs from
    a family instance and how?


    cheers,

    Frank halliday'

    I have exactly the same request as Frank.

    Do you have an idea of what could be done ?


    Thanks a lot.
