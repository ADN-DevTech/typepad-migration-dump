  body: "Dear Andy,\n\nYes, sure, absolutely possible. On the other hand, you should\
    \ also be aware that every exception handler is resource intensive and will significantly\
    \ slow down execution and consume resources. \n\nAn exception handler should be\
    \ designed to handle unexpected, exceptional cases only. \n\nExceptions should\
    \ be exceptional:\n\n<a href=\"http://www.jacopretorius.net/2009/10/exceptions-should-be-exceptional.html\"\
    >http://www.jacopretorius.net/2009/10/exceptions-should-be-exceptional.html</a>\n\
    \nDetermining whether a duct is round or not should not be exceptional, this is\
    \ standard. How about simply querying the Connector.Shape property?\n\nTherefore,\
    \ it is normally sufficient to implement a single top-level handler at the level\
    \ of the application mainline, e.g. in the external command Execute method. \n\
    \nCheers, Jeremy."

  body: "Hi Jeremy. I found another way getting the multishape transition type inside\
    \ the DuctType.\nOval Duct = Multishape RecttoRound is null;\nRectangular Duct\
    \ = Multishape OvaltoRound is null;\nRound Duct = Multishape RecttoOval is null;\n\
    \nIt works fine for me:\nParameter ovaltoround = tipod.get_Parameter(BuiltInParameter.RBS_CURVETYPE_MULTISHAPE_TRANSITION_OVALROUND_PARAM);\n\
    \                Parameter recttooval = tipod.get_Parameter(BuiltInParameter.RBS_CURVETYPE_MULTISHAPE_TRANSITION_RECTOVAL_PARAM);\n\
    \                Parameter recttoround = tipod.get_Parameter(BuiltInParameter.RBS_CURVETYPE_MULTISHAPE_TRANSITION_PARAM);"

  body: 'Dear Rolando,


    Thank you very much for this very useful info.


    Would you like to provide a minimal sample RVT project and a minimal source code
    snippet exercising this?


    Then I''ll promote this to a main blog post, since it looks like the cleanest
    solution to date and should be made as easy to find as possible.


    Thank you!


    Cheers, Jeremy.
