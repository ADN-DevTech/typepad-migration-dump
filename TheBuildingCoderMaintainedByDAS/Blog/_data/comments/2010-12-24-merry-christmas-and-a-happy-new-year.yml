    Can you please help me to create a new ViewSheetSet object.


    My Intention is to create a new ViewSheetSet, which will be displayed in the Export
    DWG dialog.'

    \ to use \n\nforeach (ViewSheetSet viewSheetSet in m_doc.ViewSheetSets) ...\n\n\
    or \n\nViewSheetSet newSheetSet = printMan.ViewSheetSetting.CurrentViewSheetSet;\n\
    \nboth of which access existing view sheet sets only.\n\nCheers and Happy New\

    \ I am having few more doubts.\n\nDoubt 1:\nI tried to ViewSheetSetting::SaveAs\

    \ tell me that whether it will help me to make a clone of ViewSheetSet.\n\nDoubt\
    \ 2:\nI want to display the preview of selected view. I tried with ExportImage\
    \ function. But I am getting flickering(or Repaint - with Current view cleared\
    \ in Project preview Area). Please clarify that is it possible to generate the\
    \ preview of View without using ExportImage? If the answer is No then Please clarify\
    \ that is it possible to prevent the Flickering in Project preview."

    1. As said above, I am not aware of any possibility at all in the Revit API to
    create a clone of a ViewSheetSet.


    2. I am not aware of the flickering you describe. If you are an ADN member, please
    submit a DevHelp Online case so that we can explore this further. Actually, it
    would be useful even if you are not, so we can examine and fix this issue.


    You can create a preview of your own, of course, using the Windows API to take
    a snapshot of the current screen or a specific window, although it is obviously
    more work than using the built-in Revit API method, and of course we are interested
    in getting this method to fulfill all your needs properly and reliably.


    I googled for the search keys ".net screen snapshot", and the many hits I received
    all included screen snapshot utility source code.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    Sorry! My reply is late.


    Since We are ADN member, I will post in DevHelp Online.


    I think, If we use the Snapshot utilities(in .Net or VC++), In case of any window
    exists on our view, then the window existing area cannot be retrieved.


    Anyway I will post it in ADN soon.'
