  body: "Hi Jeremy,\nI had the issue with auto-sizing gridview columns also.\nI did\
    \ a little research, and found that it's easier to set it per column (hope this\

    \ ByVal mode As DataGridViewAutoSizeColumnMode)\n        dgData.Columns(column).AutoSizeMode\
    \ = mode\n    End Sub\n\n     mainForm.SetDataGridColumnWidthMode(2, DataGridViewAutoSizeColumnMode.DisplayedCells)\n\
    \                    mainForm.SetDataGridColumnWidthMode(3, DataGridViewAutoSizeColumnMode.Fill)"

    \ case?\n\nI did, and it appears that due to my usage of the DataSource property,\
    \ I have no columns in that sense.\n\nThe Count property of Columns is zero, so\
    \ attempting to make calls like this throws an exception:\n\n  dg.Columns[2].AutoSizeMode\n\

    \    = DataGridViewAutoSizeColumnMode.Fill;\n\nCheers, Jeremy."

  body: 'Hi Jeremy,


    Ah, sorry that didn''t help. (I didn''t test it.)

    The thing I used it for was printer devices, their status, and queue length etc
    (read-only), so a DataTable was a perfect Datasource for that.


    From what I read about the column count on the datasource (list) issue, it''s
    to do with late-binding of data - so I guess your solution works best!!


    I hope you''re having fun in Toronto!


    Kind regards,


    Matt'

  body: 'Hello Jeremy,


    I didn''t understand the above example completely.

    I have questions like: which file are you talking about ? there is no namespace
    and the filename + extension.


    I am a very layman person, just started working 2 days before on Revit 2016.


    Need to ask you how to get started with creating a solution (class library / usercontrol
    library / wpf application) and connect with Revit, there are no proper guidelines
    for this.


    Can you make a layman blog post for me and for the starters.

    I am very desperate to learn this tech.'
