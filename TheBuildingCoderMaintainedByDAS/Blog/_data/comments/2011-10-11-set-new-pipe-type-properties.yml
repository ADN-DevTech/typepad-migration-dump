  body: The heart of any plumbing system is pipe. Understanding different types of
    pipe fittings are compatible with one another, and particular types of connections
    are the most secure and appropriate to carry particular types of substances does
    however require expert advice.

  body: 'Dear Jeremy Sir,

    I m stuck at one point in Revit Mep 2013 that i did in Revit Mep 2012.

    I m not able to set default Junction for pipe type.

    In 2012, RBS_CURVETYPE_DEFAULT_TEE_PARAM did the work, but not in case of 2013.

    Please Help.


    Regards,

    -Nitin.'

  body: "Dear Nitin,\n\nIn Revit 2013, you have to use the new routing preferences.\n\
    \nThe routing preferences enable you to select your preferred pipe and duct fitting\
    \ types for various materials and sizes. It can be used to set routing preference\
    \ policies for end users and query fittings and segments used for given size criteria.\n\
    \nThe RoutingPreferenceManager class is used to manage routing preference rules\
    \ for segments and fittings or query the fitting or segment chosen by Revit for\
    \ a given size condition. The MEPCurveType class now provides a RoutingPreferenceManager\
    \ property to access the main routing preferences object for that type. This is\
    \ currently only support by the derived PipeType and DuctType classes.\n\nRouting\
    \ preferences choose the first symbol in a rule list matching the given criteria.\
    \ To ensure that a certain symbol is chosen for a given scenario, you can either\
    \ set appropriate size criteria, or temporarily re-order the rules using the RemoveRule\
    \ and AddRule methods.\n\nProgrammatic use of routing preferences is demonstrated\
    \ by RoutingPreferenceTools SDK sample discussed below. \n\nCheers, Jeremy.\n\
