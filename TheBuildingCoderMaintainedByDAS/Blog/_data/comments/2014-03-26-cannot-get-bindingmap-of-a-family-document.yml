  body: 'Jeremy,

    Thanks for the help, removing the binding made it possible, but has brought up
    another issue. It is saving the changes in the family level, not the project level.
    If the user makes another change, say adding another shared parameters, it will
    add the change to the family itself but not the family within the project. I am
    assuming what happens is the first time we place the family it updates the parameters
    first and inserts the family but without binding it any changes after the model
    is placed does not update. We are trying to resolve this, but any tips would be
    appreciated.

    Thanks,

    Brad'

    Thank you for the appreciation. I am glad it helped.


    It sounds like you need to force Revit to reload the family.


    It may refuse to do so if it is under the impression that nothing relevant changed.


    In that case, you may need to force the reloading even more, e.g. by deleting
    the existing instances in the project, including its symbols and the family definition
    itself.


    Cheers, Jeremy.
