    How do I do this (Create Section View Parallel to Wall)without creating new section
    views, ie by changing only the crop box of an exisitng view.



    Regards,

    Hep'

  body: 'Dear Hep,


    In the code above, I create a bounding box and pass it into the view creator method
    CreateSection.


    To modify an existing view, simply set up the same bounding box and assign it
    to the view SectionBox property instead.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: "Hi Jeremy,\nHave you been outdoor adventuring much lately?\nHere is a question\
    \ I have been googling and had no success on so far. \nDo you know of a better\

    \ confused when it sees a second floor and create a view with a height close to\
    \ the top of the floor rather than the ceiling?\n\nheres an example of my code:\n\
    ==============================\nElevationMarker marker = ElevationMarker.CreateElevationMarker(doc,\
    \ viewFamilyTypes.First().Id, xyz, elevationScale);\n             \n         \
    \   \n//create 4 internal elevations for on each marker index\nfor (int i = 0;\
    \ i < 4; i++)\n                     {\n                    \nViewSection elevationView\
    \ =\n marker.CreateElevation(doc, floorView.Id, i);\n\ncheers,\nNik"

  body: 'Dear Nik,


    Thanks for asking. No, not as much as I would like and need, I''m afraid. Too
    many comments on the blog, and other queries  :-)


    No, I have never heard of such an issue before. How strange.


    It also seems a bit strange to me to create the marker first, and then use that
    to drive the elevation. Sounds like a very user interface oriented sort of approach.


    Have you tried to create the elevation all on its own? And add a marker afterwards?


    Alternatively, you should actually be able to create the new elevation anywhere
    you want and then modify its Z coordinate later to anything you like.


    I hope this helps.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    I was in a Mountaineering club in Adelaide, however I have been kept busy by my
    firm and as such have done one rail trail since moving to Brisbane.

    I will give your approaches a go and will let you know what works.

    Thanx again,

    \ to make this little app run.\n The problem is when the wall is not located in\
    \ a 0 elevation level, in this case, the new section view appears some distance\
    \ up respect the wall (the Y coordinate appears to be wrong, X and Z are correct).\
    \ I have tried to understand all the steps you made, but i miss myself in the\
    \ transformation of the coordinates from the wall's bounding box to the models\
    \ coordinates, and i am afraid that there is the problem but dont know hot to\
    \ solve.\nThe next step for me is to isolate the wall in the section view and\
    \ apply a view template to this view. (some suggestions will be apreciated )\n\

  body: 'Well, i have found a way to avoid my problem.

    In the part where you create the new sectionbox, if you add the minZ and the maxZ
    to the new min and max points, you are adding a full level height more. I noticed
    thath if my wall level is 10 meters, the new view appears 10 meters upper of where
    it has to appear...


    This are my "new" min and max, and they work.

    I also changed the lenght of the view to adjust to my wall.


    XYZ min = new XYZ( -w / 2, - offset, -offset );

    XYZ max = new XYZ( w / 2 , h + offset, offset );


    Now, i am trying to select the new sectionview, apply a view template and isolate
    the wall... and have no idea of how to do it hehe'
