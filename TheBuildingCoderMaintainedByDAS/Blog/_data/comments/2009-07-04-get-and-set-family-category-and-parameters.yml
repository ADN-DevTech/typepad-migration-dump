  body: "Dear Jeremy,\n\nI have a similar question:\n\n'Part Type' is a property (form\
    \ a Pipe Fitting) in a family document, like 'OmniClass Number' is. \n\nHow do\
    \ I get access to it from my main document? \n\nMy main document contains code\
    \ to calculate the radius of pipes & fittings in a Sanitary Symstem. There's a\
    \ difference in PipeFittings (elbows, cross, transition,... = 'Part Type'), with\
    \ causes the code to change for some fittings. I want to filter them with the\
    \ 'Part Type'- property.\n\nThnx anyway,\nDorien"

  body: 'Dear Dorien,


    Thank you for the mail and sorry for not picking this up earlier. There is a PartType
    property on the MechanicalFitting class, but other for elements I do not believe
    that there is any access to this property except the view that you mention when
    looking at it in the family document, so you will have to find some other way
    to identify the different types of fittings. Sorry about that as well.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    Actually, you are in luck: yes, it is.


    Please refer to the following little note in


    <a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2013/04/whats-new-in-the-revit-2014-api.html">http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2013/04/whats-new-in-the-revit-2014-api.html</a>


    <b>Families & content</b>


    <b>Family category</b>


    The property


    <ul>

    <li>FamilyBase.FamilyCategory</li>

    </ul>


    can now be set.  This allows the category of an family being edited to be changed.


    Cheers, Jeremy.
