  body: "Good Morning Sir,\n\nExcuse me for being so insistent, but I just want to\
    \ know if I have any chance to get some feedback on the topic concerning the font\
    \ and width change that I've posted about one week ago.\n\nI don't have any idea\
    \ about how it works, how long it takes and/or how long is your list of questions\
    \ to answer, but it would be really great to know if there’s any hope to have\
    \ an answer.\n\nI thought initially that maybe the question is so stupid that\
    \ it isn’t even worth an answer, but it seems that is quite relevant, because\
    \ I saw that Avatech have that nifty utility called Change Case, and I assume\
    \ that if it’s possible to scan the model and change the text case, it should\
    \ be possible to change the font and most probably the width too.\n\t\nI have\
    \ a reasonable VBA and VB experience and I’m OK in VB.NET, but I can’t find any\
    \ suggestion or chunk of code, although I've tried also on Autodesk's Revit API\
    \ forum. I apologise again for insisting on this, but we need it very badly.\n\
    \nThanks again for your time,\n\nConstantin"

    No worry about the insistence. I''m sorry to say that I have not seen your comment,
    nor can I find it anywhere when searching for "thebuildingcoder constantin" or
    going through the list of comments to the blog. When and where did you post it,
    please? Can you provide a link to it, or maybe simply repeat your question?


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: 'Dear Jeremy,


    Interesting post as always. Thank you.


    I''m intrigued, though: Is your contributor suggesting that SOA should be used
    for all Revit API development, or just for certain applications?


    Other reading on the web seems to suggest using SOA for more loosely-coupled areas
    of development (at the ''edges'' of your solution), while keeping to an OO approach
    within the core of your solution.


    I look forward to the trailed article!


    Regards


    David Wood'

    I am glad you like it, and so do I. I am publishing the follow-up article today,
    and it will include an example add-in and source code. If you look at that, I
    think all will become clear.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'
