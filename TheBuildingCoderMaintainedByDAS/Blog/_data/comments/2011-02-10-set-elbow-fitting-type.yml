    I have a question to you. Could you tell me how to use Revit API to delete families
    types, such as fill patterns and line patterns. Pleae give me some examples if
    you have talked in your blog before. Thanks'

    I have checked the website, but I still need more help.


    Now I am doing a project to develop a application which is used to delete fill
    patterns, object styles, line styles, line patterns, and materials. It should
    work similar to Revit Architecture deleting them. I do not know how I can use
    Revit API to implement it.'

    Really, I cannot say much more than I already did about this. In the post I point
    to above, Chuck was looking for something very similar to what you are aiming
    for. You might want to contact him and ask him for some consulting services to
    implement what you need, if you are unable to do it yourself.


    Cheers, Jeremy.
