  body: 'HI Jeremy,


    The default version of webbrowser control in winfrom and WPF  application is 7,
    that''s why you have JavaScript problems.


    The solution its to change default IE version of webBrowser control to IE 9 or
    IE10


    To control the value of IE Emulotator of WebBrowser Control, using the registry,
    add the name of executable file (revit.exe) to the following setting and set the
    value to match the desired IE version.( 9000 for IE 9 , 10000 for IE10)



    HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Main\FeatureControl\FEATURE_BROWSER_EMULATION->revit.exe
    = (DWORD) 00009000



    I have a code that allows you to add the key automatically, want you that i add
    it in GitHub Project?

  body: 'Dear Jabir,


    Thank you very much for the information and your kind offer.


    Since this is just a minimal simple sample, I do not think it needs any additional
    bells and whistles, really. That will just make it harder to understand and not
    be an efficient use of your time.


    Also, that is really a pure .NET issue that has next to nothing to do with the
    Revit API.


    I think your hint above should be enough for anyone interested in taking this
    further.


    I assume that the solution that you are suggesting to add is amply documented
    online already as well, isn''t it?


    Thank you!


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    Thank you for your reply.


    Yes the solution is amply documented on the internet, for people interested simply
    search <b>".NEt browser emulation"</b>.


    The MSDN page that deals with the subject is:
