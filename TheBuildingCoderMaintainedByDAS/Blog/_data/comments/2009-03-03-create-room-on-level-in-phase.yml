  body: 'Dear Antonio,


    Have you checked the PhaseCreated property? According to the section 12.3 ''Phase''
    in the SDK developer guide ''Revit 2009 API Developer Guide.pdf'', the Phase Created
    property has the following characteristics:


    - It identifies the phase in which the component was added.

    - The default value is the same as the current view Phase value.

    - Change the Phase Created parameter by selecting a new value from the drop-down
    list.


    Does that work for you?


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: 'Dear Antonio,


    I just started a new Revit project and created a room using the default settings.
    The Phase property in the element properties dialogue in your screen snapshot
    shows ''New Construction''. The PhaseCreated and PhaseDemolished properties are
    indeed both null, at least as far as RvtMgdDbg tells me. But the parameters that
    you mention are not null for me:


    ROOM_PHASE     Phase     110001 ''New Construction''

    ROOM_PHASE_ID  Phase Id  110001 ''New Construction''


    These are both ElementId properties. I do not see a ROOM_PHASE_NAME property,
    however. This is in Revit Architecture 2009, build 20080915_2100.


    I created another phase named ''Phase 1'', set the view property Phase property
    to that, created another new room, and determined that its parameters also return
    the expected value:


    ROOM_PHASE     Phase     130449 Phases ''Phase 1''

    ROOM_PHASE_ID  Phase Id  130449 Phases ''Phase 1''


    Cheers, Jeremy.'
