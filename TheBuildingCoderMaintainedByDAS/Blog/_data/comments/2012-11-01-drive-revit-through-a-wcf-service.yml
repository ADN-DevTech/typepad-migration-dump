    \ increase latency by a second. You can try different values of sleep and see\
    \ how it affects the CPU usage."

  body: 'Dear KR,


    Thank you for your valid and helpful suggestion.


    It all depends on your needs, of course: immediate response to the Revit task
    request versus overall load on the CPU.


    When in heaven''s name are we ever going to be allowed to keep our cake and eat
    it too?


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    I was hoping that we could do more with the ExternalEvent when it was introduced
    with 2013. As you know, it does require the user to be active in order to be raised.
    It would be nice if this was not the case. Hopefully in 2014.

    I also don''t think that ExternalEvent would help. <a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/files/devcamp_2012_2-3_asynchronous_interactions.pdf"><b>External
    Events are internally still based on Revit idling</b></a>

    In my opinion the only correct subscribing and unsubscribing idling event can
    avoid CPU loading.

  body: 'Hi all,


    there are sitations where OnIdling event won''t be fired.


    Think of error or warning dialogs.

    In fact, each dialog which remains opened will block the event.


    Additionally, there are types of views in which no transactions can be performed,
    for example all 3D views (excepting "{3D}") plus list views.


    If you want Revit to show an element, think of handling the "Looking for good
    view" dialog which needs to be closed before proceeding, anyway.


    Best regards,

    Rudolf'

    I think you do not mean *all* 3D views except "{3D}", only all *perspective* views.

    I know very well that API may be *active* in zero document environment.

    But of course there is no document database to work with, so there is no much
    sense in performing commands on this level, except opening files or returning
    some application level data, e.g. Revit product info, version etc., of course.

    You could open an unlimited number of *background* documents. That should give
    you enough to play with. Who needs a user interface, or a human user, for that
    matter? Just another source of errors and confusion.  :-)

  body: 'Hi Jeremy,


    I''ve done *both* so far:

    driving Revit from outside (11/12/13) and creating/opening (family) documents
    in the background.


    When editing documents, it may happen that user interaction is needed.

    We cannot handle all possible errors by the failure API (many, many BuiltInFailure
    definitions, and think about overriding the default settings accidentally; in
    fact we could suppress even severe errors without the user even noticing it).

    So of course I who needs a user if you could do the job using a script ;-)

    But no, noo, there will always some dialogs which must be handled by user.

    Auto-clicking them, will be difficult because of localization issues and because
    of the fact that Revit (and its plug-ins) may use a mixture of WPF and WinForm
    controls. See UIAutomation for further information ;-)



    Cheers,

    Rudolf'

    Downloading the code, I installed the Revit 2013 in window sever2012 R2, Anything
    I tried!!!!!


    But there is a problen "RevitExternalAccessClient.exe cannot connect Revit & revit
