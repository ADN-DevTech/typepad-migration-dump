  body: "Hi Jeremy,\n\nI am trying to set viewsheet parameters from a text file, and\
    \ have a mysterious exception upon commit.  I have an error handler that does\
    \ not capture an error, so am at a loss and have begun breaking things apart.\n\
    \nI read the values from a text file, so my outer loop is a streamreader.ReadLine()\
    \ call\n\nThen I loop through my viewSheets collector to find the right sheet.\
    \  It strikes me that I may be better off using LINQ to find the particular sheet,\
    \ but cannot find a suitable example.  I am assuming that Revit won't allow a\
    \ sheet to have a Sheet Number that is not unique (untested assumption for now).\n\
    \nSo here is what I'm doing, but the compiler doesn't like it.  Can you help?\n\
    \nstring[] linearray;\nViewSheet vQuery;\nFilteredElementCollector Sheets = new\n\
    \    FilteredElementCollector(doc).OfClass(typeof(ViewSheet));\n\nvar query =\
    \ from element in Sheets\n    where \n    element.get_Parameter(KeyParameter.Text).AsString()\
    \ == linearray[0]\n    select element; //linearray is a split (\\t) on the ReadLine\n\
    if (query.Count.AsValue() > 0) //doesn't like this\n    vQuery = (ViewSheet) query.ElementAt(0);\
    \ // I know this is wrong . . . how do I get the actual sheet?\n\n\nThanks for\
    \ your help!"

  body: 'Dear Paul,


    First you talk about an exception. That is a runtime error.


    Then you say the compiler is complaining. That is a compile time error, and not
    an exception.


    Anyway, I would suggest that you search for some examples of using the .NET generic
    templated collection extension method FirstOrDefault in conjunction with a FilteredElementCollector.


    <a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?q=FirstOrDefault+FilteredElementCollector">http://lmgtfy.com/?q=FirstOrDefault+FilteredElementCollector</a>


    I use that myself on a regular basis, and I think that does exactly what you need.


    LINQ will not be any better than anything else.


    The only thing that makes a difference performance-wise is whether you use the
    Revit filtered element collector functionality, which is very fast, or something
    based on .NET that post processes the results of the former. That is significantly
    slower.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    I am looking to read xml data into a revit addin. Are there any Revit specific
    tutorials I could possibly read up on?

    There are about umpteen zillion .NET XML libraries you can use, plus this functionality
    is provided by the standard .NET framework:

  body: 'Hi Jeremy,

    Why do we need to set the transaction property to read-only? How can I edit the
    family doc to acquire it''s path then famdoc.close() it in readonly mode as this
    causes an exception.

    cheers
