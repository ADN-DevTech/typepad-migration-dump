    Could you verify this?

    ....The Revit 2010 subscription packs provide the same minor fixes and enhancements
    and the web update 2 plus significant additional new features........


    I asked the question through Autodesk Support Request and they responded saying
    that the two need to be installed separately (WU2 and Advantage Pack)

    Thank you.'

    Yes, I can confirm this. Here is a statement on this from Anthony Hauck, Revit
    Design Product Line Manager:


    Confirmed. If you have access to both, installing the Subscription Release Pack
    is sufficient to receive both the bug fixes of UR2 and the feature enhancements.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: 'Dear Prasad,


    I finally received a thorough explanation for the current and future situations
    with IFamilyLoadOptions.


    This is an interface class which provides call-back functionality for specific
    family load situations through the two events OnFamilyFound and OnSharedFamilyFound,
    called when a family or a shared family being loaded was already present in the
    target document, respectively.


    They do both take an output argument in which the event handler has the opportunity
    to specify whether the existing family''s parameter values should be overwritten,
    so it looks as if they should be just what you need to handle the situation you
    describe.


    Unfortunately, this does currently not work the way one might expect. Once a family
    has been loaded into the project, it will not be reloaded later, even if it was
    modified, and attempting to use this event handler throws an exception.


    Ultimately, we would like the family to be reloaded if it has been edited, even
    if it is already loaded. That behaviour will be provided in a future release.


    Sorry for the bad news.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: 'Jeremy,

    I have installed the x86 version of the subscription pack.  I tried accessing
    the new keyboard shortcut utility you mention above, however, I am unable to locate
    it?  The feature summary states to review the user guide, however, there is not
    an updated user guide to download. Any ideas?

    Thank you

    Travis'

    Nope, sorry, no idea. I copied the text quoted above out of whatsnew_architectureq3.pdf
    and assume that the same is provided in whatsnew_mepq3.pdf and whatsnew_structureq3.pdf
    as well. Good luck hunting it down.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    Gamal Kira now provided some sample code which actually does show the IFamilyLoadOptions
