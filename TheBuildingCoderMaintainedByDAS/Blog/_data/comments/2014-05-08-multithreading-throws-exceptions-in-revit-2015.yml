  body: 'Hi Jeremy,


    Also in a single threaded context Revit 2015 will raise various exceptions where
    2014 didn''t.


    1. Subscribe to the UIControlledApplication.ViewActivated event;

    2. Start Revit 2015 and open f.i. 10 3D views in tile mode; (My model had linked
    models, maybe this matters)

    3. Switch rapidly the ''Visual Style'' of each view;

    After circa 10 times, Revit will crash.

    has a machine with at least 2 cores these days. Your users will thank you. Your
    developers will thank you even more. The light, you have to see the light, damn

    Yes, absolutely. Great suggestion. Please refer to this recent discussion on the

  body: "Hello:\n\nI was wondering if the DirectX 12 API will effectively enhance\
    \ overall performance in Revit. Sorry if I sound ignorant in any way. I do not\
    \ know about any programming or its framework.\n\nI hope DirectX 12 will help\
    \ utilize all new high-end hardware capabilities to there possible potential.\
    \ Because, most of the time when there is a big Revit file when waiting while\
    \ it generates/processes. I noticed that all my hardware isn't running at desired\
    \ higher levels that could potentially make the process much faster. Therefore,\
    \ my point is that the hardware is being under utilized... I see this for all\
    \ programs/games not just Revit.\n\nIf DirectX12 API is going to implemented with\
    \ Autodesk products. When do you think it will be released? I know the official\
    \ DirectX12 will be released by the end of this year. Also, will this only support\
    \ Windows 8+?\n\n(The hardware I am referring to is: CPU, GPU, (HDD/SDD/mSATA)\
    \ read/write speeds, RAM I/O)\n\nMy 'Uber' Laptop Specs:\n\nBrand/Name:\tMSI GT70\
    \ Dominator Pro-1039\n\nProcessor:\t 4th Gen Intel Core™ i7-4940MX Processor Extreme\
    \ Edition (8M Cache, 4 Cores, 4.00GHz)\n\nHDD Drives:\t3 x 128GB mSATA (Super\
    \ RAID 0 v.2) + 1TB 7200 RPM Hard Drive (For Storage)\n\nGraphics:\tNVIDIA GeForce\
    \ GTX 880M GDDR5 (8.0GB) + Intel® HD Graphics 4600\n\nMemory:\t32GB DDR3 1600MHz\
    \ (Four 204Pin SODIMM Sockets)\n\nPrice: \t\t$ 3,999.00 U.S. Dollars\n\n\nComments:\n\
    \n- Will multiple mSATA/SSD (as Super Raid 0) improve performance when working\
    \ on a Central file (disregard network usage)? So far I haven't seen to much of\
    \ a difference when compared to regular HDD except when opening/saving files.\
    \ \n\n- What will be the best stripe size to set the RAID 0 to? I am curious about\
    \ how this will affect large Central files.\n\n- What kind of RAM provides the\
    \ most performance. Right now I have 32GB of DR3 1600MHz that came with the laptop.\
    \ I am not sure what brand it is. Thinking about trying out Corsair Vengence Pro\
    \ DDR3 2133 MHz 4 x 8GB. Do you think RAM performance is a large factor to speed?\n\
    \nI know its not a 'workstation' certified computer, because it contains a gaming\
    \ video card. However, this thing is a monster and is actually much faster than\
    \ than any computer or certified 'workstation' I have ever used. I am very supprised\
    \ when I see any wait time while views/tasks generate or process, because all\
    \ of the hardware is barely being utlized... Not once have I seen anything reach\
    \ 100% performance capacity except when I was upgrading 5 files to Revit 2015\
    \ and had VMware Workstation running all at once.\n\nOverall, I love this laptop\
    \ very much when, because I hate any possible lag or sluggish performance. I wish\
    \ I had one of these at the office too.."

    We came across the same issue described in Question 2 and submitted a ticket in
    ADN, the case NO is :10402895  (a project is attached in the ticket)


    I tried the workaround you suggested using Application.DoEvents() but the problem
    is the form has to be modaless which is not what we want.


    Update Revit parameter in the background while running windows form with progress
    bar will not crash Revit before 2014.  Any solid workaround for providing status
    update in the front while   call time-consuming API  at the same time?'

  body: 'Dear Limin,


    You absolutely cannot safely perform any modification on the Revit database or
    use the Revit API in any way whatsoever. even for read-only purposes, except in
    a valid Revit API context:


    Here is the final word on that:


    <a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2014/11/the-revit-api-is-never-ever-thread-safe.html">http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2014/11/the-revit-api-is-never-ever-thread-safe.html</a>


    A valid Revit API context is provided by Revit by a callback function, e.g. execution
    of an external command or in an event handler.


    The workaround is clear and simple: implement an external event.


    As far as I know, this has also been clearly communicated to you in the ADN case
    you raised.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: 'Jeremy,


    Thanks for the explanation. But the workaround uses modeless form, that means
    user still can make change through Revit UI while .net API is called,isn''t that
    less protected?


    Did you run the project I attached with my ticket? as you can see, it''s not multi-thread
    of Revit,  it''s just one thread of Revit running in the background while a modal
    windows form update status in the front. I''m surprised Revit will crash in such
    a case  since 2015.'

    I finally got it compiled and tested successfully on Revit 2015.


    I created a pull request to update your repository with my changes.


    Can you pull them, please?


    I will happily publish this. Looks useful.


    Thank you!
