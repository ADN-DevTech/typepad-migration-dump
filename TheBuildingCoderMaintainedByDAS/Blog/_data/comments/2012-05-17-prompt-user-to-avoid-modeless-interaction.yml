    I have the same problem that is described in question of this post (show and select
    element - properties panel not updated correctly).


    In your answer you said this:

    "The only way I know to safely achieve what you are aiming for is to make use
    of the Idling event or the new external event framework."


    I tried your suggestion. I changed the ModelessDialog example from samples of
    Revit 2013 SDK. I added one more operation to it that should select and show element,
    but the problem remains: element is selected and shown but properties panel is
    not updated.


    Do you have any suggestion how to solve this problem?


    Thanks, R.A.'
