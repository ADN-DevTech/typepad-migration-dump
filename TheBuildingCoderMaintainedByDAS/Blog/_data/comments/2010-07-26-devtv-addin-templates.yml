  body: 'Dear Zhu Xiaomeng,


    I am sorry to say that there is no API access to create an in-place family.


    You can however create a new family document in memory using the Application NewFamilyDocument
    method, populate that with the required elements, and load an instance of it into
    your project, all without ever saving it to disk.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    I''m going to modify my old RevitIniFileEntries console routines to open the .addin
    file and replace the hardcoded path with the [InstallLocation] of an AddIn. This
    is a workaround because nobody can tell me how to use the RevitAddinUtility.dll
    in a console app to write the .addin file directly from within an installer. the
    example uses a Windows form app with buttons, which is totally useless for installations
    (where the RevitAddinUtility.dll needs to be used). I''ll let you know when it''s
    done.'

    \nFrom that, I get the strong impression that the RevitAddinUtility.dll can be\

    I have tried using this addin template, Is it possible to use it to create .addin
    files as a process or is it just a reference material to show how to use it? I
    noticed it allows me to save the project as something else, but i can''t seem
    to get the newly generated addin file to run or show up when i launch revit! I
    wonder if I am missing something which i should know about?'

  body: 'Dear Jenny,


    I suggest that anybody who wants to make use of these templates first learn the
    basics of creating and installing and launching and debugging  a minimal Revit
    add-in by hand. You can learn the basics of the Revit API very efficiently by
    downloading the Revit SDK, looking at Chapter 2, Walkthroughs, and working through
    the DevTV recordings. All of these are available on the Revit Developer Center:


    <a href="http://www.autodesk.com/developrevit">http://www.autodesk.com/developrevit</a>


    That will answer all your questions much more completely than I can do here.


    Please also note that I later posted my personalised updated versions of the DevTV
    templates:

    thank you very much for this template, it really helps making the process smoother.

    one problem though, i converted a while ago to Visual Studio 2010 and the template
    does not work with it anymore.

    i have followed the template migration guideline(<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc512930.aspx)">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc512930.aspx)</a>

    the the VS conversion wizard can''t seem to find the "Microsoft.VsSDK.targets"

    i would really appreciate your help in this matter'

  body: "Jeremy,\n\nThank you very much for providing the DevTV Add-In Templates.\
    \  I'm still struggling just a bit with them to get them to fully work properly.\n\
    \nAt work we exclusively have Revit 64-bit only and when I utilize the template-\
    \ I have to keep changing the paths that are default to the debugging location\
    \ for Revit.exe as well as the reference locations to the RevitAPI.dll and RevitAPIUI.dll.\n\
    \nwhen I look at the TemplateRevitCS.csproj that is a part of the .zip package,\
    \ I see this as:\n\n$(ProgramFiles)\\Autodesk\\Revit Architecture 2011\\Program\\\
    Revit.exe\n\nBut whether I keep it as the above or change it to...\n\nC:\\Program\
    \ Files\\Autodesk\\Revit Architecture 2011\\Program\\Revit.exe\n\nThe debug location\
    \ still comes up as C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Autodesk\\Revit Architecture 2011\\\
    Program\\Revit.exe\n\nBut in reality my location is:\n\nC:\\Program Files\\Autodesk\\\
    Revit Architecture 2011\\Program\\Revit.exe\n\nSo once I utilize the template\
    \ - then go to Project - Properties - Debug section and manually browse to that\
    \ location then the project debug location is fine.\n\nThen I have to go to the\
    \ Reference section of my solution - where I see RevitAPI and RevitAPIUI with\
    \ a yellow exclamation mark and have to re-assign such as well to C:\\Program\
    \ Files instead of C:\\Program Files (x86).\n\nYou can also note as part of looking\
    \ at the .csproj file provided - it shows:\n\n\n      False\n      $(ProgramFiles)\\\
    Autodesk\\Revit Architecture 2011\\Program\\RevitAPI.dll\n      False\n    \n\n\
    Which above is stating that its 32-bit via the x86.  So I thought I could merely\
    \ change the x86 to x64 and save the file but that didn't work successfully either.\n\
    \nCould you either re-post adjustments to the template files to get it to work\
    \ with an exclusive install of 64-bit Revit?   I'm just learning and do not know\
    \ how to correctly edit such templates for Visual Studio?"
