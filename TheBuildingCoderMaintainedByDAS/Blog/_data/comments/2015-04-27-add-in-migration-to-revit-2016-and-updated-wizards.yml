    \ doing the job in 2015).\nAlso, I've checked with the sample from the SDK and\

    The SetBarResult method is marked as obsolete:


    <a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/img/SetBarResult_obsolete.png">http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/img/SetBarResult_obsolete.png</a>


    You will have to redesign your add-in to use a newer method.


    Sorry about that.


    For any  additional queries on this, I woulod suggest that you provide a reproducible
    case so we can explore it in more depth:

  body: 'Hi Jeremy,


    indeed is marked as obsolete the SetBarResult method that''s receiving a string
    as resultType, but not the one receiving LinearResultType (see in your attached
    image).

    As for a reproducible sample, you can use the "StoringResults" sample from Revit
    SDK 2016\Structural Analysis SDK, together with its revit project "ResultsInRevit.rvt".

    You''ll notice that the same sample is working in Revit 2015, but not in 2016;
    in 2016 only the "Other" result are shown in Results Explorer dialog.

    I''ve realized that for pushing a different kind of results, I have to created
    a different package, but the current implementation is making All value from ResultsPackageType
    obsolete.

    I am new to coding the Revit API and Starting with the 2016 edition is creating
    problems for me as a newcomer.


    I am trying to add a Parameter to a project by adding parameters from a shared
    parameter file and binding them to a category by name.


    I was using this code as a starting point point but hitting a no overload error,
    presumably because of changes in the API.

    As I am a beginner using revit I am not yet comfortable using the Shared Parameter
    changes and would appreciate any help I can get to jump-start.


    Thank you,

    I have to make a WPF form plug-in, where form is having a Infragistics grid that
    will fetch the data from Revit, how to achieve it ?

    In layman terms, when I go to External Tools, I click on the addin / plugin, and
    the WPF form opens with Infragistics Grid having the data of current project.


    Can you please tell me something about this ?'

    Thanks for the reply.

    But, here comes another problem before having a look over above url.

    I created a HelloWorld.dll and added it as plugin in Revit 2016, working successfully.


    <b>Problem:</b> I want to debug the code (well it''s just 2 lines for now) but
    Revit 2016 is opened and closed at the time I run my VS class library.


    I have given proper path name as to run external command.


    Need your inputs on this.'

    I didn''t understand the example completely. (<a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2014/06/the-revision-api-and-a-form-on-the-fly.html)">http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2014/06/the-revision-api-and-a-form-on-the-fly.html)</a>

    I have questions like: which file are you talking about ? there is no namespace
    and the filename + extension.


    I am a very layman person, just started working 4 days before on Revit 2016.


    Need to ask you how to get started with creating a solution (class library / usercontrol
    library / wpf application) and connect with Revit, there are no proper guidelines
    for this.


    Can you make a layman blog post for me and for the starters.

    I am very desperate to learn this tech.'
