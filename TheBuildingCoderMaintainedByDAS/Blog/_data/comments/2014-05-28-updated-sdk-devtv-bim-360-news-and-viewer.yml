  body: 'Hi Jeremy,


    I have to do some silent task(like AutoCAD pushDBMode, popDbmod), on opening the
    revit project file. I meant to say that save confirmation dialog should not occur,
    because of my task.


    Is it possible to do like this?

    Yes, of course this is possible.


    Here is a whole bunch of discussions on topics related to detecting and handling
    dialogues and failures:

    \ not clear, I think so.\n\nPlease refer the following case in AutoCAD:\n1. Open\
    \ the drawing.\n2. On Document_Created event do the following task.\n    PushDbMod\
    \ -> do some task -> popDbMod.\n3. If the close the drawing, No confirmation will\

    \ by us, will be hidded to user.\n\nIs the above case possible(Because in recommended\
    \ posts will suppress the dialogs or save the drawing)?\n\nSo Sorry, If I am wrong.\n\

    Thank you for the clarification.


    Revit does not provide an equivalent of the AutoCAD DBMOD variable.


    In order to modify the Revit model, you need to at least start and commit a transaction.


    That will mark the database as modified, and there is no way to suppress that.


    Please be aware of the deep and far-reaching paradigm differences between Revit
    and AutoCAD:
