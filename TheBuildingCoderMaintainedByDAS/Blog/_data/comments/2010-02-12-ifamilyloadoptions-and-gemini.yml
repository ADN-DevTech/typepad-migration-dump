  body: 'Hi,


    I hope I understand correctly what are you trying to tell us: that this example
    should show us how to deal with annoying "Family Already Exists" dialog box.


    If that is correct, then your example does not do the job - I still get the dialog,
    when this code is executed:

    if (doc.LoadFamily(filename, out family))


    If I didn''t understand your post, then I would like to ask you, to provide us
    with the example, how to programmatically suppress "Family Already Exists" dialog
    box.


    Thank you and keep up the good work!'

  body: 'hi Jeremy,


    i had the exact same issue regarding dynamically change family and reload into
    current project.


    just wonder if there''s better way other than using redundant modeless dialogue
    and then supress it (i assume it can be supressed, right?), i''m using 2011 API
    now.


    i already filed an ADN request, and mentioned this issue to Joe Ye, along w/ your
    blog''s link to this particular issue.


    very appreciated for your clarification.


    have a great weekends!

  body: 'thanks Jeremy for your reply.


    what i means is -> in 2011 API, do we still have to call the LoadFamily method
    outside of a command context? i tested yesterday, seems it''s still the case,
    so i used modeless dialogue just as your RevitTest sample, but i don''t need that
    modeless dialogue indeed, that''s why i call it redundant modeless dialogue.


    very appreciated for your help.


    cheers.

  body: "Dear Ning, \n\nNo, you no longer have to call it outside the command context\
    \ in Revit 2011, as far as I know, it should work completely normally now.\n\n\
    The only issue that you need to be aware of in Revit 2011 is as designed: when\
    \ you reload a family, nothing happens unless the family really has been modified\
    \ since it was last loaded.\n\nTherefore, this call is not executed either unless\
    \ the family really was modified since it was last loaded.\n\nThat has confused\
    \ some users, and that is the only issue I am aware of nowadays. Maybe this is\
    \ the same thing you have run into as well?\n\nCheers, Jeremy."

  body: 'jeremy,

    Just need more details about "IFamilyLoadOptions" in 2011, I tried using the example
    you have posted here, options work in 2011, and we dont need to call them outside
    the project, But, if i am trying to reload(overwrite existing) family into the
    project I still get the warning box asking the user to select "overwrite the existing
    family and its parameters" (somehow i thought "IFamilyLoadOptions" should have
    taken care of this) how can i resolve this problem?'

    \ implementation was derived from both ExternalCommand and IFamilyLoadOptions,\
    \ and obviously implemented all the required methods: Execute, OnFamilyFound and\
    \ OnSharedFamilyFound. The latter two were simply:\n\npublic bool OnFamilyFound(\
    \ \n  bool familyInUse, \n  ref bool overwriteParameterValues )\n{\n  return true;\n\
    }\n\npublic bool OnSharedFamilyFound( \n  Family sharedFamily, \n  bool familyInUse,\

    \ true;\n}\n\nDoes that help in any way?\n\nCheers, Jeremy.\n-----"
