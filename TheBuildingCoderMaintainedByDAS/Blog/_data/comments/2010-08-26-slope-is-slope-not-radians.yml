  body: As a minor correction, slopes are unitless, which is to say that using feet,
    meters or parsecs for your project will all provide identical results. It's easy
    to see that  6"/12" = 0.5 = 152.4mm/304.8mm. This is really nice because you do
    not have to account for differing units in the calculation.
