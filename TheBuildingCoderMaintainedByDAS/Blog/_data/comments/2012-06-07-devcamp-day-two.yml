  body: I hope you don't have made the same mistake on Options dialogue WPF custom
    extensions like it's on AutoCAD. Can I cancel the closing of the dialog in the
    OnOK event handler if data entered by the user are not valid? Like the Cancel
    property of the FormClosingEventArgs?

  body: "Dear Maxence,\n\nIndeed, you cannot cancel the closing of the Options dialogue\
    \ from a custom tab extension OK handler.\n\nBecause there are many tabs in the\
    \ options dialog, it would be rather hard to figure out on which page an error\
    \ happened. \n\nImagine that you edit many items in many pages and introduce many\
    \ errors, and then click OK. How would you solve all these problems, even given\
    \ the chance to cancel the closing?\n\nMy suggestion is to report the error or\
    \ invalid input data immediately, or implement a better UI design to avoid invalid\
    \ input completely, e.g. restricting the input controls to selective widgets such\
    \ as combobox, scrollbar, checkbox, etc.\n\nLook at the standard Revit input control\
    \ under Options : General : Journal File Cleanup : When number of journals exceeds,\
    \ and try to input anything but a number in it. It immediately reports \"Unacceptable\
    \ Character - You can only type a number here.\"\n\nI am sure your users would\
    \ appreciate that kind of immediate feedback as well.\n\nCheers, Jeremy."

  body: 'Hi Jeremy,


    I would like to create such an embedded view, but I want to embed and control
    the view that is used in GbXML export dialog.


    Namely, this is the "Analytical View" that shows the contact surfaces between
    spaces and walls, and that is used to make analysis computations.


    What is the best way to do that ?

    Tanks ;)'

  body: 'Dear Vi Lo,


    The only serious API support for presenting a view of a Revit model is provided
    by the PreviewControl component:


    <a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/about-the-author.html#5.7">http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/about-the-author.html#5.7</a>


    The only input and programmatic control over the preview control is through its
    constructor taking the document and a view.


    Basically, this means the following: you can use the preview control in the way
    you wish if and only if you can also set up a Revit view that displays the model
    just like that.


    Can you?


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: 'Thanks you Jeremy for your help.


    I''m currently investigating to find if the "GbXML view" can be recreated within
    the user interface.


    If I understand you well, if I manage to do that I will be able to do the same
    via API.
