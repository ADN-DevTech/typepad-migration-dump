    if a FamilyInstance is line-based, its Location may be a LocationCurve instead
    of a LocationPoint.

    In this case it may be useful to test if the middle point of its curve is in room.


    Bye,

    I wanted to ask a question, not related to your above post.  However I believe
    you have handled this before.  i am looking for some guidance.


    I have some walls in a drawing, and I have command that will insert beams across
    the walls.  When the beams are inserted I would like to modify their analytical
    line but in order to do that I need to get elementsatjoin for the beam, which
    returns nothing.  However when the command ends I can select the beam I just inserted
    and get the elementsatjoin then.  I have already tried to regenerate the drawing
    in my code but this still does not help.  Do you have any insight?  How can you
    get elementsatjoin form a beam that you just inserted through code?'

    ... or the entire curve, even, or whether the curve intersects the room boundary,
    or whatever.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    Yes, you definitely need to regenerate in between. If that is not enough, it sometimes
    helps to split the operation into several separate transactions and commit them
    in between as well:
