  body: 'Hi Jeremy,


    I have a similar issue where after creating a extrusion I cannot get a valid reference
    to a planar face of that extrusion in order to add a connector to it. The following
    statement throws a null object exception even though I can get the properties
    of that face prior to this statement. Regenerating keeps telling me that its set
    to automatic even though I have it called out as manual.


    Dim connSupplyAir As DuctConnector = RevitFIF.NewDuctConnector(m_planarFaces(4).Reference,
    DuctSystemType.SupplyAir)


    sorry for the vb, I know your a c# guy :)


    thanks!'

  body: 'Dear Steve,


    Yes, that sounds like a similar issue. How about creating the extrusion in one
    transaction, closing that completely, starting up a new separate transaction afterwards,
    and determining the reference and creating the connector in the second one?


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: "Hi Jeremy,\n\nChinese Spring Festival is coming to end and I'm back to Revit\
    \ again. But this time I would ask question on behalf of Zhao Hu, one of my friends.\n\
    \nZhao's scenario is to create about 80,000 sweeps in Revit in one shot. Per his\
    \ test, it will take about 20 hours, while his workmate can achieve it in Rhino\
    \ within 10 minutes. Zhao expects that Revit could do faster. \n\nAs Zhao's test\
    \ was done in an open family document (with UIDocument), I tried to use in-memory\
    \ document but it still take about 18 hours to draw all 80K sweeps.\n\nZhao noticed\
    \ that although all the drawing work is done in a single transaction, it seems\
    \ that Revit tries to regenerate the document after there are sweeps created already\
    \ automatically. We did set the RegenerationOption to be Manual. We say it because\
    \ we saw Revit progress bar in the bottom-left corner indicates it.\n\nOur questions:\n\
    1. can we prohibit Revit's automatic regeneration?\n2. more straightly, do we\
    \ have any approach to get the job done faster?\n\nThanks a lot! And Happy Chinese\
    \ Snake Year!\n\nBest Regards,\nDavid Tan"

  body: 'Dear David,


    Happy New Year to you!


    Welcome back to Revit development!


    As I already just answered Hu Zhao, there may be a stray regeneration happening
    in sweep creation.


    If you can demonstrate that (with a sample that creates something less than 80,000
    sweeps, please :-), please provide a reproducible case to prove that which I can
    submit to the development team for further analysis.


    It is also worth asking what the use case is for 80,000 sweeps in one family.
    Are you possibly modelling things so detailed that that a building model with
    multiple instances of this will have performance problems?


    Maybe you could add an image of what you are creating to motivate the development
    team by helping them understand.


    Thank you!


    To answer your questions:


    1. Nope, no way you can stop that, afaik.


    2. Nope, not that I know.


    Sorry about that.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: 'Hi Jeremy,


    Thanks for your clarification!


    About the scenario, I don''t have more details at this moment. Hu Zhao just told
    me that it''s one of his study subjects. I''ll talk with him about it later and
    see what we can provide to you furthermore. I don''t have the code or testing
    data on this machine, but I''ll send them to you via email tomorrow, as well as
    an image.


    P.S. as you might already know, Hu Zhao is in Zurich now. And thanks for Internet
    which makes me as "close" to you as him :)


    Best Regards,

    David Tan
