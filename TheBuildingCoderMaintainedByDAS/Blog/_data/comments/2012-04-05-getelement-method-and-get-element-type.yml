  body: I am also in the process of upgrading some existing code in Revit 2012 and
    was running into an issue. I was previously using famiysymbol class to reference
    light fixture types.  In the process of upgrading my FamilySymbols to ElementTypes,
    I noticed that the Family property is missing.  It is no longer an option in the
    API as it was with FamilySymbol.family and I did not see any reference to it in
    the DB snoop (although Light Fixtures are still classified as FamilySymbols in
    Revit 2012). Any idea how I can access the family of an ElementType? Thanks.

    In C#, you can use
