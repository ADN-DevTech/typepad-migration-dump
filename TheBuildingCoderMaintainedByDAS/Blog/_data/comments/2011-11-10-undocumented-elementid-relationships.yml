    according to the Sketch theme, I must add that the Sketch.Profile property is
    readonly, so neither stairs nor FilledRegions can be modified this way.


    *sigh*



    Cheers,

    The best-laid plans of mice and men gang oft agley...


    The best way to obtain access to data not yet provided by the Revit API will always
    remain submitting a wish list item and waiting for a while for the official implementation...  :-)

    wise words.

    But even if we cannot *modify* a stair this way, we can get *more* information
    than we would get if we just read the stair''s parameters or properties.


    For example, using the longest CurveArray in the Sketch.Profile of a stair, we
    can combine it with the number of steps and in the result, we can get the 3D data
    of each step''s front side.

    The Curves in the profile won''t give us the correct z data because the sketch
    is just a  projection, but using the stair''s height and number of steps, we can
    get the z distances for each step.

    The steps'' 3D LocationCurves.



    Bye,

    Rudolf


    See you in Munich :-)
