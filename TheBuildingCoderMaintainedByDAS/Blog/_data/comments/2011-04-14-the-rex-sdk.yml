  body: 'Dear Revit,


    As you can see from the screen snapshot above, the "Revit 2012 API Developer Guide.pdf"
    is included in the Revit 2012 SDK.


    That in turn is part of the Revit product installation package. Search for RevitSDK.exe
    in the subdirectory Utilities\SDK of the temporary installation files.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    I am glad to hear from you too, and nice to know that you are Chinese :-)


    Joe Ye says that you are copying and translating a lot of Revit API information
    on your web site. Maybe you should contact him and ask him for permission to re-post
    these contributions.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'
