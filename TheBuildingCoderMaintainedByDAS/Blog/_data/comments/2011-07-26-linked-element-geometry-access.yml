  body: 'Hello Jeremy Tammik


    In here, I want to ask some question about the workset in Revit Architecture 2011.


    when I create the workset in revit 2011, and I can set the specific workset visible
    or hidden in the view.


    if I set the specific workset hidden, How can I get the element in the workset
    that is set to be hidden in the view.


    I know that in revit 2012 ,it provide some relative method to resolve thie question,
    but in revit 2011 , I can''t find them!


    Therefor, I hope you can give me some example code which how to get the element
    in workset by RevitAPI 2011.


    Best Regards

    Ian'

    These methods are new in Revit 2012, and are not available in Revit 2011.

    But I want to ask whether it exists other methods to find the element in workset

  body: 'Hello sir,

    I am getting problem to get a real time view(like in case inserting door on a
    wall,after selecting the door, i am not getting the door view of moving along
    with the mouse cursor only getting cursor and if click on wall directly it will
    inserting.) before placing family inserting.


    my code is like this:


    public Autodesk.Revit.UI.Result Execute(ExternalCommandData commandData, ref string
    message, ElementSet elements)

    {

    ..........

    try

    {

    trans.Start();

    Family family = null;

    FamilySymbol symbol = null;

    if (doc.LoadFamily(@h4, out family))

    {

    foreach (FamilySymbol s in family.Symbols)

    {

    symbol = s;

    }

    View view = uidoc.ActiveView;

    Reference r = sel.PickObject(ObjectType.PointOnElement, "Select");

    Element elem = doc.GetElement(r);

    Wall wall = elem as Wall;

    XYZ globalPoint = r.GlobalPoint;

    XYZ levelPoint = new XYZ(10, 10, 1);

    Wall wall = doc.GetElement(r) as Wall;

    FamilyInstance instance = doc.Create.NewFamilyInstance(levelPoint, symbol, wall,level,StructuralType.NonStructural);

    }

    trans.Commit();

    }

    catch (Exception)

    {


    }

    return Result.Succeeded;

  body: "Hello Jeremy!\nCould you give me please your advice in next problem:\nI have\
    \ a big model with several linked files. One of this link is reflected (mirrored)3\

    \ so I'm getting all links, their transformation and then convert each linked\
    \ model (processDocument method):\n\n foreach (RevitLinkInstance linkInstance\

    I cannot say off-hand, so I am asking the development team for you.


    One other thing you might try, though, depending on what you are exporting, and
    how and why:


    Use the custom exporter framework.


    It includes data for linked files.


    In fact, it includes everything that you see on the screen, honouring your view
    specific setting:

    \ was absolutely in other place.\nI was wrong when thought, that property HasReflection\

    The reason for the disappearance of the mirror links was very easy - they just\
