  body: 'Jeremy,


    Thank you for your wonderful site. I think I have a bit of a different type of
    problem for you though.


    I am working on importing custom made walls (exported as DXF files) and would
    like to import them into revit so that they act as walls instead of a normally
    imported object. However, changing the family type of an imported file to a system
    family such as a wall seems to be about impossible. I have looked into importing
    it as something else, such as a window, but still have had no luck actually getting
    the imported object to behave like something else. Besides creating a new family
    and defining all parameters manually, is there anyway to get an imported object
    to behave like an already defined type?


    Thanks,

    Will'

    Thank you for your appreciation.


    Glad you like it.


    Your question is not all that different, though.


    Other people have done similar things in the past, even created entire university
    campuses and cities:

    As far as I can tell, I think the easiest way for you to go would be to implement
    an add-in to create the new wall elements programmatically directly in Revit.


    Forget about DXF, just import the wall type, start and end point (or more complex
    curve data, if non-linear), top and bottom constraints (if vertical), and Bob''s
    your uncle.


    Here is a somewhat related wall creation sample:

    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    Unfortunately, I need to keep the exact look of the wall intact. The DXF/DWGs
    I''m using are the product of a very specialized wall generator, the ShopFloor
    app. Is there any way for me to maintain the design characteristics of the imported
    CAD file while also giving it the ability to act as a wall within revit?


    Thank you for your time,

    Will
