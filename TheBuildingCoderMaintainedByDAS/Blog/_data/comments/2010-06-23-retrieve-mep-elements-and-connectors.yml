    Keep us up to date with what happens with this code and where it goes Jeremy!


    Nice work.

    Thank you for your appreciation and encouragement!


    I will certainly keep up with this and keep you up to date as well.


    Another important step in the implementation of this tool is described in today''s
    post:


    <a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2010/06/revit-parent-window.html">http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2010/06/revit-parent-window.html</a>


    This topic is on generic technology to handle a modeless dialogue, so not MEP
    specific.


    I am still working on the full and final description of the complete application.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: 'Dear Manish,


    Since families are user defined, it is hard to say anything for sure at all.


    Here are some features that were added related to families and their origin in
    Revit 2013:


    1. SpatialElementCalculationPoint


    This class provides access to the "Room or Space Calculation Point" seen in families.
    The Spatial Element Calculation Point is graphically showed as a location point
    marker with a "snake" line from the origin of the family. If the Spatial Element
    Calculation Point is turned on, this point will be used as a search point for
    room and space relations for all instances of this family. The API offer creation,
    read and modification options for this object type.


    2. NewFamilyInstance validation


    Some validation has been added to overloads of NewFamilyInstance(). This validation
    is intended to prevent use of the incorrect overload for a given family symbol
    input. For specific details on the exceptional conditions which

    will be validated, consult the documentation.


    3. Family.PlacementType


    This new property provides information about the placement type for instances
    of the given family. PlacementType roughly maps to the overloads of NewFamilyInstance.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'
