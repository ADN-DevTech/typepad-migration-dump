  body: 'I apologize if you actually quoted me in this post’s title, Jeremy, but it
    is not exactly correct that the entire Revit API is NEVER thread safe. There are
    in fact a few functions that ARE thread safe. For example, the ExternalEvent.Raise
    is thread-safe, naturally.

  body: The issue is not the API, the problem is the UX. Have to want to solve the
    UX before concurrent techniques could be applied to the public API.

  body: 'Dear Arnošt,


    Thank you very much for noticing and pointing this out!


    It was no direct quote, just an assumption based on the preceding discussion.


    Thank you for pointing out that exceptions do exist.


    I added that to the main blog post body to ensure that fact is not missed.


    Cheers, Jeremy.
