    I just installed Revit Structures, Architecture 2011 and the SDK, but I can not
    find RevitAPI.dll and RevitAPIUI.dll in their installation folder or anywhere
    else on my Computer!

    Where are they?'

    Apparently the installation utility creates two program folders for Autodesk_Revit_Structure.
    One directly on C:/Autodesk/ and the other on C:/Programs Files/Autodesk. The
    dlls are under the C:/Programs Files/Autodesk (as they should be), and not in
    C:/Autodesk where I was looking!'

  body: 'Hi,


    Im guessing if its possible to use the Revit API to create an external program
    that launch Revit, opens a rvt file , modify some parameters and then renders
    it.

    Is it possible or it can only be used to create add-ins?


    Thank you very much,


    Alvaro'

    Right you are, the directory structure under C:/Autodesk contains temporary installation
    files. Glad you found the right place!

  body: 'Dear Alvaro,


    I am sorry to say that your guess is wrong, and the API can currently only be
    used to create add-ins.


    You may be able to achieve what you want anyway, by launching Revit by some other
    means and then making use of an add-in that is launched on start-up or when the
    initial document is opened. Please refer to numerous posts on this subject, e.g.


    <a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2010/04/asynchronous-api-calls-and-idling.html">http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2010/04/asynchronous-api-calls-and-idling.html</a>


    Journal files may also help.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    I am a Revit API newbee and would like to learn from you. Followed some of your
    example and Audesk''s sample codes, I am able to create a tab, panel and commands
    to load a family symbol.  However, I do not know how to 1) set the loaded family
    symbol as the current default symbol; 2) how to place a loaded family symbol,
    e.g., the column, into the project at around the mouse point; 3) how to get the
    XYZ of the current mouse point position?


    Thank you in advance for the help.'

    Can you give a VB example of how to search through a Revit document for different
    structural elements (Structural Beams, Columns, Floors, Walls and Footings)? I
    have used before the 2009 RstLabs, but now it has to be modified for the new 2011
    API. Can we now use regular VB.net collections (that can be iterated using For
    Each)?

    Thank you for your help.'

  body: 'Dear Karl,


    I believe you cannot programmatically define which symbol should be the current
    default, so you will have to forget number 1, I''m afraid.


    Regarding number 2, you might want to have a look at the method UIDocument.PromptForFamilyInstancePlacement
    to prompt the user to interactively place one or more instances of a particular
    FamilySymbol.


    Regarding number 3, you can use Selection.PickPoint to prompt the user to pick
    a point on the view active work plane. You cannot query the current cursor position
    without picking, though, except using the Windows API, but that will not give
    you access to any Revit coordinates. There is actually no way to determine a 3D
    position from a 2D mouse cursor without additional picking or some other assumptions
    about how the mouse cursor should be projected into the model.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    is there a way to get the settings of the "column top''s connection types or the
    "column base''s connection types"in the structural settings dialogue which the
    user define.

    for example the user set 3 structural connection types for  COLUMN TOP ,and set
    5 structural connection types for COLUMN BASE,how can i get the 3 types or the
    5 types , for now i can only use the filter to filter all the structural connections
    types ,but can not classify them.'

    Are you aware of the StructuralSettings class? I was under the impression that
    it provides access to all the properties affected by the Structural Settings dialogue.
