    I do not believe that the Revit API currently provides directly support for the
    insertion of revision clouds.


    You could try launching the built-in Revit revision cloud command programmatically
    instead.


    Look for UIApplication.PostCommand in

  body: 'Jeremy,


    Thanks for your response.


    I read through all of the links you''ve provided and I also tried custom exporter
    xml. It looks great but I still can''t find a thermal properties of my model''s
    elements in the exported xml file.


    I made a little research by Revit LookUp and figured out that thermal mass/resistance
    are linked to my geometry through "object type" and its parameters. So I guess,
    custom exporter exports just parameters that appear visually (texutre, glossiness
    etc.) but not linked parameters such as thermal properties. Is it right, Jeremy?


    If yes, is there alternative ways to obtain these thermal parameters with geometry?
    Or I need to export geometry and thermal properties separately and then (somehow)
    link them together?


    Thank you

  body: 'Dear Alexey,


    What you say makes a lot of sense.


    When you implement your custom exporter, you can easily query the element providing
    the geometry for its type, and query that in turn for the required properties,
    and combine all the data of interest in you output in any form you like.

    and ran into some problems with the ''My first Plugin'' tutorial.

    Using the MS VS s/w (express 2013? i think, under crap win 8.1), and typed in
    the first plug in code, but refuses to build...

    i thought i might have to ''downgrade'' to the 2010 version, since that appears
    to be what the tuts are based on, but it appears others have done this exercise
    with 2013 versions...

    the other confusing part is, .NET is apparently installed in several flavors,
    but none of them appear to work with the build...

    is there something stupidly obvious i am overlooking ?  not conversant enough
    with this to know where i am going wrong...'

    It sounds perfectly possible to me.


    If you need to interact with AutoCAD and you have both AutoCAD and Revit installed
    on the machine, you can make use of the AutoCAD.NET API from within your Revit
    add-in.
