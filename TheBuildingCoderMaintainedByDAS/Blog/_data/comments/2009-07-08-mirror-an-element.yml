  body: 'Dear Henrik,


    Thank you for the interesting query. I like it so much that I created a new post
    to answer it:


    <a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2009/07/retrieving-newly-created-elements.html">http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2009/07/retrieving-newly-created-elements.html</a>


    Here is another question that came up regarding the Mirror operation:


    Question: Is there a way to apply mirror an existing element without creating
    a new one?


    Answer: No, Mirror will always create copies of the existing elements passed in.
    To work around this, you can store their element ids before mirroring, and then
    delete them afterwards.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    I just discovered ElementTransformUtils.MirrorElement and I have to modify the
    mirrored element.


    Is there something like (entlast) in good old days?

    Nice to hear from you through this medium as well!


    Yes, the good old days are always with us!


    In the Revit API context, you can easily build your own (entlast) method by temporarily
    subscribing to the DocumentChanged method:
