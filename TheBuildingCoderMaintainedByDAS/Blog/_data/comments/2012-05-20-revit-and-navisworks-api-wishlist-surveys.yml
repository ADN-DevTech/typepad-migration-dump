    I think this is the right place to avoid those sentences in the future releases:


    "I''m sorry but this task cannot be done using Revit API at all"


    "Yes it can be done, anyway, but this workaround is not recommended"


    "Don''t try this at home"

    ...and so on.


    Bye,

    Rudolf'
