  body: 'Hi Jeremy,


    The Document.Close() in the 2011 API did/does close my active document. The same
    code does not work in Revit 2012 :( With the above logic, how can I click the
    ''application R'' button then select Close?


    Thanks,

    Dan'

    Oh, so you could use Document.Close to close the active document in Revit 2011.
    How strange. Others went to more effort to achieve this, by sending a Ctrl + F4
    keystroke:

    In Revit 2012, I believe you can close the active document as well or even better
    ... but probably you will not need to, in your case, since the solution I just
    posted is simpler and more elegant:

    Yes, sure, this is perfectly possible. For example, please refer to the command
    Lab2_0_CreateLittleHouse in the Revit API labs XtraCs Labs2.cs module:


    <a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2012/04/xtra-adn-revit-2013-api-training-labs.html">http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2012/04/xtra-adn-revit-2013-api-training-labs.html</a>


    It creates a little house as shown in several posts:

    The data for creating the walls and other BIM elements can come from anywhere.

  body: 'Dear Russ,


    If you are trying to send keys to Revit to launch a command, then of course this
    will not work as long as your modal form is still open, since this means that
    your own command is still active. Revit can only run one command at a time.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: I was able to use Press.Keys() to update the Properties window from my modeless
    dialog.  I first noticed that after selecting an element from my modeless dialog
    that I was able to hit the command to initiate the modeless dialog again and voila
    the properties updated to match the selected element.  Since the form was already
    open, it recognized that and ignored the rest of the application.  So by using
    Press.Keys() I send the shortcut command to initiate my modeless dialog after
    selecting the items in the UIDocument.  This has worked great so far.  It's much
    better than the other workaround of opening a family.  Thanks!

    That sounds great! Thank you for letting us know. If you could package that as
    a generic stand-alone reproducible sample, I would love to test and publish it
    for others to enjoy as well. Thank you!


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: Most of the work I do is in 2014 still.  I updated the ModelessForm_ExternalEvent
    sample for 2015 and realized the problem was corrected now making the workaround
    not needed for 2015.  Seems as though the new UIDocument.Selection.SetElementIds()
    fixed it.
