  body: 'Hi there Jeremy,

    for the passed few months i have been reading your blogs once in a while, pure
    out of curiousity. i have been working with Revit some time now, i a really want
    to dive more into the coding part of it.

    now i saw that you have put the source for download, but when trying to juist
    build it, and add it to the revit menu i get this error:


    "Revit cannot run the External Command "buildingcoder". Contact the provider of
    this external tool with the information below:


    system.typeloadexeption while creating instance of ''buidlingcoder''in "C:\.....\buildingcoder.dll

    could not load type ''buildingcoder'' from assambly ''buildingcoder, version=2.0.0.0,
    Culture=neutral, Publickeytoken=null"



    now, i dont have much experience with coding and building dll files, so i might
    be making some really stupid mistakes.

    Cheers

    Dante'

  body: 'Dear Dante,


    There is lots of material answering your question in the Getting Started category
    of this blog. I suggest you look there. Before you try to install the Building
    Coder samples, it will help to implement and install your own minimal plug-in.
    The best way to learn to do that is probably to watch and work through the DevTV
    presentation:

  body: 'Hi Jeremy,


    is there a way to position or move the label of a Dimension?


    We got that possibility in the interface: we select the Dimension and we can drag
    the label around.

    I''ve looked at the Dimension properties and functions and could not find anything
    about the positioning of the text.


    Thanks for your insight !

  body: 'Dear Gregory,


    Congratulations on getting it to works with detail lines.


    NewTextNoteCreationData is nothing more than a driver for creating large numbers
    of text notes, so it adds no functionality that is not available through the NewTextNote
    method.


    I don''t know about the text label creation. At least I cannot find any open wish
    list items for it, so I would assume you can create them.

    That sounds feasible to me. Short of going ahead and doing it, however, I have
    no additional guidance to provide on this, and I don''t have time to try implementing
    it right now.


    Good luck and best regards, Jeremy.'

    If you really need serious help urgently, I suggest you contact a professional
    consultant.


    I am only doing this for fun, you know.


    If the column is vertical, it would normally go from one level to another, wouldn''t
    it? So you can obtain its height from the level Elevation property.


    One way to get references is to shoot a ray along the column axis and retrieve
    the top and bottom faces using FindReferencesByDirection:

    I am working with macros for Revit. Above code did not work for macro. Please
    suggest code to label dimension for macro.

    You can dimension a pipe length just like any other Revit element.


    For your convenience, I put together a new topic list on creating dimensioning:

    Sorry, I am not aware of any significant differences between executing this as
    a stand-alone add-in or a macro.
