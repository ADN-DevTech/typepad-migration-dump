    to add a mechanism to families and/or projects that allows authors to lock, password
    protect, or digitally sign models?


    It seems the infrastructure is in place and just needs the interface put into
    the core Revit platform.'

    With Data Storeage on a workshared project, if a user attaches or edit a data
    store I''m assuming that the other users will not have access to that new information
    untill that user syncs with central?


    Cheers

  body: Hi Jeremy, I have noticed when a user reloads a family the extensible storage
    is reset, however when a family is reloaded via code the extensible storage is
    retained, is this your understanding? Regards Chris

  body: 'Dear Christopher,


    Hmm. That sounds a bit strange. I would not assume that any such difference is
    intentional. Could you provide a reproducible case to demonstrate this? I.e.


    <ul>

    <li>A complete yet minimal Revit sample model to run a test in.</li>

    <li>A complete yet minimal Visual Studio solution with add-in manifest so that
    we can compile, load and run the application with a single click and explore its
    behaviour live in the sample model you provide.</li>

    <li>Detailed step-by-step instructions for reproducing the issue.</li>

    <li>Specification of the exact behaviour you observe versus what you expect.</li>

    </ul>


    Thank you!


    Cheers, Jeremy.
