    Following this post and the possibilities you commented us on the training this
    week, I would like to know how much data a parameter can store. As you know in
    Autocad the XData has a limit. I really liked your idea to store a xml tree structure
    on a parameter with our custom data instead of many different parameters.


    Thanks a lot for the training the last three days, it has been a fantastic time.


    Cheers, RJ.'

    How nice to hear from you again so soon, and I am very glad you liked the training.
    I also enjoyed it very much.


    The technique of storing large amounts of structured data encoded into XML and
    then further encoded into a string using base64 encoding has been used successfully
    for some pretty large data sets. As far as I know, the only limitation is memory
    size, but of course Revit has never been tested in this context. So please be
    aware that you are using this technique at your own risk! I am planning to post
    on this topic quite soon, and will provide a detailed code sample when I do so.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    I noticed for certain special parameters I can''t access the value.

    For example with Lighting Fixtures, there are parameters like Light Loss Factor,
    Initial Intensity and Initial Color. The value field is a button, which opens
    a special window.

    Do you think it''s possible to access the value of these parameters?'

    Thank you for posting your query as a comment instead of just sending a mail,
    that helps keep things sorted and in place, and ensures that others can share
    and participate in our conversation.


    As far as I know, the only element properties accessible through the Revit API
    are the ones that are listed through the element viewer mentioned above. These
    do include some properties that are not present in the element Parameters collection.


    Have you tried to list the properties of one of your lighting fixture instances
    using this tool?


    I had a look at one lighting fixture instances in my installation, but I did not
    see the properties that you mention.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    These parameters I mentioned above are available when there is a Light Source
    Definition in the family and can be found under the Type parameters.


    When I use param.Definition.ParameterType.ToString on these parameters, the result
    is "Invalid". The value of these parameters is "0" and it''s an Integer (checked
    that with Parameters.StorageType.Integer)

    Thank you for the update and clarification. I am exploring this issue and found
    that it merits an own post, which I plan to submit next week. I hope you can wait
    until then. I wish you a nice weekend.

    Just a quick question, I was having trouble with your code above, were you executing
    this all through VSTA and the macro editor built into Revit, or through MS Visual
    Studio with DLL com links to Revit?  And was this the entire code required? Any
    clarifications would be greatly appreciated!


    Thanks,


    Brandon'

    I don''t know exactly which "code above" you mean. In any case, I almost never
    executed any VSTA code myself at all, I always use the plug-in style implementation
    as illustrated by The Building Code samples.

  body: 'Hello, Jeremy.

    In my project I''ve found parameter of particular Element that doesn''t exists
    in Element.Parameters collection.


    You wrote: "Sometimes an element will have other parameters attached to it as
    well, which are not listed in the ''official'' collection returned by the Parameters
    property. To explore all parameters attached to an element, one can make use of
    the built-in parameter checker." And nothing more. Can you explain that means
    these parameters?


    In my case I need to get length of any element if length exists. I wrote next
    code for it:

    <a href="http://pastebin.com/GgKFmxdD">http://pastebin.com/GgKFmxdD</a>

    At first In BuiltInParameters I find parametes that contains "LENGTH" word. Then
    I check if this BuiltInParameter exists in element. If it exists return value
    of this parameter. The problem there are no length parameter in element.Parameters
    but a can get it via element.get_Parameter.

    Of course I can get length of the element enumerate each parameter and check parameter
    for length but I''m curios about these "strange invisible" parameters.


    Best regards, Victor'

  body: "Dear Victor,\n\nYes, there are lots of parameters attached to elements that\
    \ do not appear in the 'official' Element.Parameters collection.\n\nYou can retrieve\
    \ them using any of the standard Element.Parameter property overloads. Yes, it\
    \ is a property, and yes, it still takes an argument, and yes, it does not exist\
    \ in C#, because it is called get_Parameter there. All a bit strange. The overloads\
    \ are \n\nParameter(BuiltInParameter) Retrieves a parameter from the element given\
    \ a parameter id. \n\nParameter(Definition) Retrieves a parameter from the element\
    \ based on its definition. \n\nParameter(Guid) Retrieves a parameter from the\
    \ element given a GUID for a shared parameter. \n\nParameter(String) Retrieves\
    \ a parameter from the element given its name. \n\nSo if the parameter you are\
    \ looking for is named \"Length\", you can retrieve it using that name.\n\nI would\
    \ recommend you not to do so, however, because this makes you code language dependent.\n\
    \nBetter is to determine exactly which built-in parameter corresponds to it and\
    \ use that instead.\n\nHere is a code snippet with a loop that shows how to retrieve\
    \ all parameters from an element. Actually, it may not retrieve all, but it mostly\
    \ retrieves more than the official Parameters collection contains:\n\nArray bips\
    \ = Enum.GetValues(typeof(BuiltInParameter));\nParameter p;\nforeach (BuiltInParameter\
    \ a in bips)\n{\n  try\n  {\n    p = elem.get_Parameter(a);\n  }\n  catch { }\n\
    }\n\nThis kind of loop to retrieve a value for each and every built-in parameter\
    \ enumeration value is also used by the RevitLookup 'Built-In Enum Snoop' in the\
    \ Snoop Parameters dialogue and my own built-in parameter checker:\n\n<a href=\"\
