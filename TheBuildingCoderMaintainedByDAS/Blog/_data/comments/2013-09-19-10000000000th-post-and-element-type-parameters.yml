    How can I access the element content of a family instance. I am working on an
    addin that automatically pick all the model lines that are contained within the
    user-selected family instances. Thanks?

  body: 'Dear Long Nguyen,


    It is simple and the blog presents numerous examples of this.


    You can also look at the Revit SDK ElementViewer sample.


    Basically, simply traverse element, FamilyInstance, geometry, symbol, instance,
    geometry.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: "Thanks Jeremy,\n\nUsing your hints, I finally managed to retrieve all the\
    \ model lines in the user-selected family instances. But I now I am facing another\
    \ issue. My aim is to use these lines for form creation. The NewExtrusionForm\
    \ method requires a array of references to these lines. However the Reference\
    \ property of these lines are null (the documentation says that this property\
    \ is non-null only when the line is obtained directly from an element, while in\
    \ my case, the line is a geometryCurve contained within a Family Instance object).\
    \ So how can I get around this. \n\nI notice that in the Revit GUI the user can\
    \ use the tab key to manually select these lines and click on the create from\
    \ button on the ribbon to create the desired form. Basically I am trying to reproduce\
    \ this process programmatically, because the project we are working on has lots\
    \ of such lines and the user cannot manually pick all of them by hand (with a\
    \ lot of tab-key pressings) :)\n\nCheers,\n\nLong"

  body: 'Dear Long Nguyen,


    Thank you for the appreciation. I am glad it helped.


    Did you set ComputeReferences to true when retrieving the family instance geometry?


    If that does not help, and your line comes from the family instance geometry,
    you may have to recreate a true model line in the current project from it and
    use that.


    Before you do anything at all, talk with a product usage expert and find out what
    the correct way is to do this manually in the user interface!


    Cheers, Jeremy.'
