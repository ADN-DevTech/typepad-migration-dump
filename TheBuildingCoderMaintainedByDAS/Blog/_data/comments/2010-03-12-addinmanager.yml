    How does one get AddInManager to appear in Revit?


    Thanks.'

    Sorry I was so slow in answering...


    The add-in manager is part of the standard Revit SDK, and you will find it in
    the ''Add-In Manager'' subdirectory of the main SDK installation folder:


    Directory of C:\a\lib\revit\2010\SDK\Add-In Manager:

  body: 'Very nice post. Finally got to use it after I found it in the RTM version
    of the SDK for 2011 (I was using the pre-release version previously and it wasn''t
    included).


    However, whenever I need to make a change to my code, I didn''t need to change
    the project name, unload the previously loaded dll and reload the new dll, as
    stated in the post. All I did was make my changes in my code, build it, and re
    run it using the AddInManager, which makes this an even better tool.'

    Thank you very much for pointing that out!


    Yes, this post was written before I was able to talk openly about Revit 2011 in
    public, which is why I had to keep quiet about the improved functionality of the
    updated version.


    Just as you say, the AddInManager now allows recompilation and dynamic reloading
    of an already loaded add-in, which should significantly facilitate some debugging
    operations, especially if they require setting up some complex context in the
    Revit project for testing.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    Thank you very much for your notes.


    No, I had not noticed this change. I don''t use the AddInManager regularly myself.
    I just start Revit from the Visual Studio debugger, test, and restart if I have
    a need to edit and recompile.


    If I really needed immediate edit-debug cycles without restarting Revit, I would
    isolate the bit of code I am working on an move it temporarily to a SharpDevelop
    macro, then move it back to the external add-in when I finished.


    Does the compilation to a separate folder solve the issue for you?


    Congratulations and thank you for letting us know.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'
