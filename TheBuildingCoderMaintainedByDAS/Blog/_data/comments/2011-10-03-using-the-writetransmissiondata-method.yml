  body: 'Hello,

    First of all i''m sorry for my poor english (French don''t like to learn other
    languages...). I''m new in making some plugin for revit and I use your web site
    all days to improve myself. But i have a problem with external file management.
    I''m able to ready links but when i want to change the path it makes me an exception.


    Autodesl.Revit.Exceptions.InvalidOperationException: Failed to transmit TransmissionData.


    It happens when revit performs this command : transData.SetDesiredReferenceData(...


    Do you have an idee of what i have to do?


    Thank you,


    V.'

    Don''t worry, your English looks absolutely fine to me!


    I am glad to hear that the blog is useful, and thank you for your appreciation.


    Sorry, I have no idea what might be going wrong at your end.


    The code above should work and make a successful call to the SetDesiredReferenceData
    method. Are you using it differently somehow?


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    I finaly found the problem. The code (or something else i did) only work on a
    closed file.


    Thank you for all you make for beginners.

  body: 'Dear Stefano,


    Thank you for your appreciation.


    I am glad that the code presented here helped with part of your task.


    Are you saying that TransmissionData.SetDesiredReferenceData method does not work
    in your case?


    Can you provide a reproducible case for that, so we can explore it further?
