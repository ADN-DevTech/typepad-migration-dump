  body: 'A couple years ago I bought a pair of active studio monitors to listen to
    music in my laptop. That and a decent audio adapter made all the difference inaudio
    formats too obvious.

    I started ripping my CDs to FLAC, but later gave up on  that, and now I have almost
    everything in WAV(PCM). Storage cost is no longer an issue nowadays and PCM =>
    FLAC only reduces file sizes to 50%, which is peanuts with today''s disk drives
    capacity.

    As all audiophiles wannabes, preserving the audio file in it''s purest format
    became paramount.

    As for the awkward quality discussion between FLAC and PCM as both are lossless
    formats, I found subtle differences listening to both formats. In the end, even
    media players (and their codecs) make the difference, as well as their output
    devices.

    I am currently using Foobar2000 with ASIO output. Give it a try, as Foobar is
    considered the most technical player and I am sure you will like the treeview
    organization setup. Here is an example:


    $if($and($strcmp(%genre%,Classical),$strcmp(%codec%,PCM)),%<artist>%| %composer%  |
    %album% )


    And it rips everything with Id3s, including WAVs.
