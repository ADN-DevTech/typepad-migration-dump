  body: "Thanks Jeremy and Victor Chekalin for sharing this utility.\n\nI used this\
    \ today and everything works fine except one minor issue. \n\n.SetLongDescription\
    \ for button description takes few seconds to show up. Why is that? \n\nWhen I\
    \ hover over normal Revit buttons, quick+short description comes up very quickly\
    \ and then detailed description comes after few seconds. \n\nIs there a way to\
    \ add .SetDescription (equivalent of .Tooltip?? standard Revit ribbon creation)\
    \ method to add quick & short description?\n\nThanks\nRahul"

  body: "Hi, Rahul.\n\nGlad you like my RibbonUtil and found it useful.\n\nCan you\
    \ provide some code how do you set quick+short description for a button? SetLongDescription\
    \ method use LongDescription property of PushButtonData class.\n\nAs I undertand\
    \ you want set Tooltip as well. I can add this method later. Or you can download\
    \ source code and add this method yourself.\n\nRegards, \nVictor."

  body: 'Hello,


    Thank''s a lot to Victor for this.

    The pros for this :

    - own tab in Revit, and not in add-ins

    - easy to use


    Just one thing miss :

    - combobox


    Starting C# for Revit, I''m not competent enough to add this in he code.
