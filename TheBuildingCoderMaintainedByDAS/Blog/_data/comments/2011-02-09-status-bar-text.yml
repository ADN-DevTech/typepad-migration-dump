  body: 'Hi Jeremy,


    Can we use UIFramework.RevitApplicationFrameStatusBar.SetText("Testing"); static
    function to change the status bar text.


    I tried this but it is not working.


    Is it possible to display the progress indicator using the static function "UIFramework.RevitApplicationFrameStatusBar.SetProgressIndicator()"?


    Thanks

    Rajeswara Rao'

  body: "Dear Rajeswara Rao,\n\nI forwarded your query to Rudolf, and he says:\n\n\
    I haven’t tested this yet. \n\nI know that there are many undiscovered methods\
    \ in UIFramework.dll, but there may be other people who spend their time to evaluate\
    \ them.\n\nNo time to do this...\n\nSo I don’t know the answer.\n\nBut I would\
    \ be happy if anyone could find it out and shares his knowledge with us ;-)\n\n\
    So please, Rajeswara, be our guest  :-)\n\nCheers, Jeremy.\n-----"
