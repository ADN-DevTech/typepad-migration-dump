    A Question: if you return "Cancelled" or "Failed" for the automatically generated
    transaction, does this still roll back the changes made in the manually created
    nested transaction? i assume it would.'

    Good question! I would assume so too. On the other hand, I follow the maxim of
    the German sayings "traue niemand ueber dreissig" and "vertrauen ist gut, kontrolle
    ist besser": "trust nobody over 30", and "trust is good, checking it out is better".


    If you really want to know for sure, you cannot trust me or any documentation.
    The only place to put your trust is in the source code and your own foolproof
    testing.


    So please check it out and let us know.


    We''ll trust your resulting statements on it  :-)


    Cheers, Jeremy.
