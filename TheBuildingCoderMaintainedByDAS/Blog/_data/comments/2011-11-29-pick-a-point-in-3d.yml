  body: 'Hi Jeremy,


    you may extend this method for measuring purposes.


    Pick two different points and calculate the three distances in relation to x,
    y and z axis plus the direct distance between the points.


    For Example, in my German AutoCAD there is a command called "Abstand", this means
    "distance" in English.


    Befehl: AB

    ABSTAND

    Ersten Punkt angeben:

    Zweiten Punkt angeben oder [Mehrere Punkte]:

    Abstand = 30.3549,  Winkel in XY-Ebene = 339.45,  Winkel von XY-Ebene = 0.00

    Delta X = 28.4242,  Delta Y = -10.6531,   Delta Z = 0.0000


    This AutoCAD command returns much more than only the direct distance between two
    points, as you see.

    I think this method could easily implemented via Revit API, too.


    So what would you say ?



    Cheers,


    Rudolf'

    I think you can do this with just one call. When you pick a face, the reference
    also includes a point that indicates the place you picked.

    Is there a command to work with camera perspectives instead of isometric view
    in Revit?


    Thank you,

    Hola, ¿que tal?


    You can look at Chapter 18 Views in the developer guide to see what you can do
    programmatically to set up and manipulate views. That includes creating and activating
    a perspective view.


    On the other hand, you should be aware that Revit disables add-in commands and
    use of the API when a perspective view is active:
