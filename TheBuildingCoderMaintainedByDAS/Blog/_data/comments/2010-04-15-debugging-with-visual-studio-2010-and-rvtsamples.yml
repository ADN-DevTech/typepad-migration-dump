  body: 'I have followed the above instructions to use Visual Studio 2010 with Revit,
    but my Breakoints in Visual Basic do not work. The Execute function in Visual
    Basic 2010 runs, opening Revit but it does not stop at the break points.

    Any ideas why?

    I am using .NET Framework3.5'
