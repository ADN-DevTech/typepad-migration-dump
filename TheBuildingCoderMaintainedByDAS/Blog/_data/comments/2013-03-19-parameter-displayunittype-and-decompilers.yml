  body: 'I''m a bit sceptical that the (> 100) check will always be a valid approach
    for future Revit versions. A more robust approach may be to combine a try loop
    with intelligence as to what parameter types have previously been tried and caused
    the exception i.e. at run time you store parameter types that have caused an exception
    to a collection and then query that for the current parameter type before inspecting
    it''s DUT.  Therefore if you are testing 100 things of the same parameter type
    then you only cause an exception once (although 100 exceptions might be quicker
    than looking through a list of integers 100 times).


    I''ve read that the problem in general with extensions to objects you don''t control
    is that they stop working when the people that do own the objects add methods
    to them with similar signatures. I imagine the easy way around this would be to
    ensure that the argument signature to the extension is one that can''t be inherently
    duplicated, say if it contained a required input argument of an object type found
    only within the extensions class itself. The more convenient these extensions
    are the more you use them and thus the more of a nightmare it becomes when Autodesk
    add a method to one of their classes that duplicates the signature of your existing
    extension. You''ll obviously only get the error at runtime and you may not get
    the error at all because the duplicated method may return acceptable results for
    some random situations.'

    I like your moniker  :-)


    I also like your scepticism and careful forward thinking.


    Thank you very much for two very valid suggestions!


    Furthermore, looking through a list of integers can be speeded up by converting
    it to a dictionary.


    Cheers, Jeremy.
