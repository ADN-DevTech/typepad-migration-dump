  body: "Dear Anthony,\n\nPlease have a look at this post:\n\n<a href=\"http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2010/05/detail-curve-must-indeed-lie-in-plane.html\"\

    \nYou should be able solve your issue using the NewSketchPlaneContainCurve method\
    \ described in \n\n<a href=\"http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2010/05/model-curve-creator.html\"\
    >http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2010/05/model-curve-creator.html</a>\n\
    \nBy the way, you seem to be obtaining your two line endpoints p and q from an\
    \ existing line in the first two lines of code. You then proceed to create a new\
    \ line using the same points. That seems like a waste of effort to me. Finally,\
    \ you create a model curve based on the latter. Maybe all of that can be achieved\
    \ in one fell swoop using the CreateModelCurve method I present in the latter\
    \ post.\n\nPlease let us know whether it works. Thank you!\n\nCheers, Jeremy."

    Billiant, My app now works perfectly.


    I''m generating some model lines from a topo surface, this enables our users to
    edit the top of retaining walls etc to follow the ground line cut away by building
    pads.


    See link below for finished code.

  body: "Dear Fizze,\n\nWhen you say 'get area', do you mean calculate the area? That\
    \ is a common algorithm which I implemented in the method GetSignedPolygonArea\
    \ presented in \n\n<a href=\"http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2008/12/2d-polygon-areas-and-outer-loop.html\"\
    >http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2008/12/2d-polygon-areas-and-outer-loop.html</a>\n\
    \nYou cannot create a Face instance yourself, because it is basically a read-only\
    \ object returned by the Revit geometry library when you query existing building\
    \ elements for their geometry.\n\nCheers, Jeremy."

    I''m trying to use this class inside a Revit 2014 Macro, and I''m getting a lot
    of reference errors and warnings.

    Being a complete newbie in this field, I feel lost.

    Does this code still apply to 2014 API or should something be changed for it to
    work?'

    As you can see for yourself above, this code was published in 2008.


    It needs adapting to run on Revit 2014.


    However, the Creator class introduced and listed above is included in The Building
    Coder samples, and they are up to date on GitHub:
