    Thanks for cleaning up and sharing. It is always enlightening to watch one''s
    written code with some logic applied - even for this small sample.


    Most progress in my short life as a revit-api developer is related to the comprehensive
    knowledge base provided by your blog, so I''m to be able to contribute. Hopefully
    I will get the opportunity again.


    Best regards

    - Peter'
