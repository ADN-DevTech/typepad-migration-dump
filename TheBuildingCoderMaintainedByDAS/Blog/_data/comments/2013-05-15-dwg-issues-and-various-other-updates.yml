  body: While linking to CAD files (SAT) with API, there exists no option to indicate
    that placement should be produced with concern to "Auto-on common coordinates"
    (not centre or start, translated from Russian). May be such a hiden option realy
    exists?

  body: 'Dear Valdemar,


    Is this possible through the user interface?


    In general, if a feature is not available in the product through the user interface,
    then the Revit API will not provide it either.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    Yes, that is my take on this.


    I guess you would have to launch the explode command via PostCommand or something.

  body: 'Dear Pavel,


    Please describe exactly what you are trying to achieve, and how, and what behaviour
    you are observing.


    The best and clearest way is normally by providing a minimal sample project and
    a reproducible test case, i.e.


    <ul>

    <li>A complete yet minimal Revit sample model to run a test in.</li>

    <li>A complete yet minimal Visual Studio solution with add-in manifest so that
    we can compile, load and run the application with a single click and explore its
    behaviour live in the sample model you provide.</li>

    <li>Detailed step-by-step instructions for reproducing the issue.</li>

    <li>Specification of the exact behaviour you observe versus what you expect.</li>

    </ul>



    Thank you!


    Cheers, Jeremy.'
