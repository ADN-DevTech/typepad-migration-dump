    Let me know...

    Thank you for your interest, but unfortunately there are no more live trainings
    planned in Europe for the immediate future. There are a few webcasts scheduled
    that you can participate in, and also recordings from previous webcasts are available,
    as well as the Revit DevTV session, which is the best place to start.

  body: 'Hi Jeremy,


    As I keep working on my proposal for Kean''s competition on F#, I was wondering
    if the possibilities of parallel processing via F# Asynchronous Workflows (as
    shown by Kean <a href="http://www.typepad.com/services/trackback/6a00d83452464869e2010535ba8716970c)">http://www.typepad.com/services/trackback/6a00d83452464869e2010535ba8716970c)</a>
    can be applied to REVIT. I was thinking on using it for massive data read and/or
    update.


    I also have the feeling that problems with the integrity of the database can also
    happen.


    Could it be possible to have some feedback on this?


    Thanks a lot in advance,


    Cheers, Ramon J.'

  body: 'Hi Ramon,


    I am very excited to see what project you come up with using F#!


    Revit does not support multithreaded access, so if you parallelise some processing
    in F#, the different threads will not be able to interact with Revit simultaneously.
    You can of course parallelise any pure computation you like, gather the results,
    and then apply those to Revit from the main thread. The image processing samples
    that Kean just published demonstrate this kind of approach with AutoCAD:


    <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2009/02/parallelized-pixelization-inside-autocad-using-f.html">http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2009/02/parallelized-pixelization-inside-autocad-using-f.html</a>


    He parallelises the getAverageColour step, but leaves the changeColour step out
    of it, which applies the changes to AutoCAD.


    Cheers, Jeremy.
