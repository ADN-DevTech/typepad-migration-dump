  body: 'Dear Caroline,


    Yes, indeed, the unit handling has been completely overhauled in the Revit 2014
    API.


    Have you looked at the What''s New section in the Revit API help file? I normally
    discusses such changes.


    Have you searched for occurrences of these methods in the Revit 2013 and 2014
    SDK samples, and compared the differences there? That would provide an exact mapping
    from old to new.


    Those are the two places I would start looking.


    Unfortunately, the current pre-release does not include the most up-to-date SDK,
    but it will be posted any day now on the ADN web site.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: "Hi Jeremy,\n\nI checked out your leads and found that the method GetDisplayUnitType\
    \ does the trick. So this little correction gets it rolling again \n\n//FormatOptions\
    \ fo = document.ProjectUnit.get_FormatOptions(ut);\nUnits units = document.GetUnits();\n\
    DisplayUnitType dut = units.GetDisplayUnitType();\n\nI suspect that ParameterUnitConverter\
    \ could be simplified or  even replaced with some of the new methods but it will\
    \ have to be another day for me to check this out. Thanks again.\nCaroline"
