    \ var geom = OneGroup.get_Geometry(opt);\n  var solid = geom.FirstOrDefault()\
    \ as Solid;\n  SolidEl = FreeFormElement.Create(doc, solid);\n  view3d.IsolateElementTemporary(SolidEl.Id);\n\
    \  ---> error while .Create - null reference;\nI succeeded only by creating a\
    \ new document, copying the group to it and  performing the export with the new\
    \ document, followed by removal of the group. Was forced to use  the suppression\
    \ of unwanted messages. \nIs there an easier way?"

  body: 'Dear Valdemar,


    I cannot really say at all off-hand. All I could possibly do would be to research
    it using RevitLookup and the other database exploration tools, just like you.


    For more interactive API access to explore convoluted and nested properties like
    geometry and groups, you might also want to try out the Revit Ruby and Python
    shells:

    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    I would like to ask about the license for View and Data API. Is it free? What
    other software I need to run a 3D or 2D file in the viewer?


    Thanks'

  body: 'Dear Bilal,


    Yes, the View and Data API is totally free.


    You need no other software whatsoever to run it, just a WebGL-capable browser.
    All modern browsers are WebGL enabled.


    The viewer will remain free forever. The translation and storage steps may or
    may not have a cost in the future. That is still undecided. Very probably, they
    will remain free for small volumes and non-commercial use.
