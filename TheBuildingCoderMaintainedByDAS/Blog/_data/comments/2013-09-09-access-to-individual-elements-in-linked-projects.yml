    Ive got an interesting situation with a (consultant''s) Revit file that is linked
    in...("origin to origin"/auto by shared coordinates)


    When I try to relate the ''internal'' XYZ LocationPoint of the linked document
    to the main model, they are ''off'', because the Project Point was set ''differently''
    (relative to the geometry of the project)


    I thought that I could just get the ''Project Point'' from each model and figure
    out the ''offset''/difference is between the two with -:


    ElementCategoryFilter filter = new ElementCategoryFilter(BuiltInCategory.OST_ProjectBasePoint);


    But .... the "Internal" XYZ "LocationPoint" of the ProjectBasePoint is not exposed
    via the API/Snoop tool.


    So, How can one relate 2 model''s XYZ coordinates accurately, when their ''Internal''
    0,0,0 are in "different" positions relative to the ''common'' Project Base Point?


    I must admit, I am not an architect/draftsperson/modler or math(s) expert - maybe
    it is straight forward...


    Many thanks,

    Kon.'

    How to tag element in a linked project ?

    I use the this method to tag a linked pipe element but it throw an error  please
    advise thanks :)


    LocationCurve loc = pipe.Location as LocationCurve;

    XYZ startp = loc.Curve.GetEndPoint(0);

    XYZ endp = loc.Curve.GetEndPoint(1);

    XYZ midp = loc.Curve.Evaluate(0.5, true);

    newtag = DOC.Create.NewTag(view, pipe, false, tagmode, tagorian, midp);'
