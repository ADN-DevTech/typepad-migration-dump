  body: 'Hey, Jemery:


    I tried to use Autodesk.Revit.Geometry.Element in my project. But it shows me
    the following message "type or namespace name ''Geometry'' does not exist in the
    namespace ''Autodesk.Revit'' (are you missing an assembly reference?)


    Should I add more reference library or anything else I need to do?


    Thanks very much.

  body: "Dear Rui Liu,\n\nNope, you do not need any other than the two references\
    \ to RevitAPI.dll and RevitAPIUI.dll in order to obtain access to the full Revit\
    \ API.\n\nThe namespace Autodesk.Revit.Geometry was provided in the Revit 2010\
    \ API, though, and is obsolete now.\n\nIn Revit 2011 and 2012 the geometry elements\
    \ were moved into the namespace Autodesk.Revit.DB.\n\nYou need to change the code\
    \ to use that namespace instead.\n\nAn easy way to create all the required 'using'\
    \ statements automatically through Visual Studio Intellisense is using the Ctrl-'.'\
    \ keystroke combination described in \n\n<a href=\"http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2010/07/linq-methods-and-visual-studio-tips.html#2\"\
