    Is there a way to retreive the default project template file or assign it at runtime.


    The app.Option.LibraryPaths property seem to exclude that.

    Nadim'

    I assume that the same applies to the default file as to the default path.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    Sorry, no idea. That is more of a product support than an API issue, of course.
