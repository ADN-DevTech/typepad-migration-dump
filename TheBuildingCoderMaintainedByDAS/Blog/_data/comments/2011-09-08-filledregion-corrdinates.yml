  body: 'Hi Jeremy,


    I can confirm that this also does it with RevisionClouds.

    In that case, the sketch.Profile will contain straight lines instead of the arches
    we expect.

    The arches that we see in the RevisionCloud are the result of the fact that RevisionClouds
    use some kind of line-based 2D family. The resulting arches are self-similar,
    so we could get the arches by calculation.



    Cheers,

    Rudolf'

    \nYou may be able to make use of the known trick, described for instance by Rolando\
    \ Hijar, who found a way to create railings using the Revit 2012 API before the\
    \ introduction of the new railings and stairs in Revit 2013:\n\n\"First I pick\
    \ an existing railing and create a group of it. Then copy the group, ungroup and\
    \ change the railing location line. I did this to place railings over the top\
    \ of walls in a perimeter fence.\"\n\n<a href=\"http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2009/02/list-railing-types.html?cid=6a00e553e16897883301676406fe61970b#comment-6a00e553e16897883301676406fe61970b\"\

    \ \n\nPlease let me know whether this can be used to create revision clouds. If\
    \ so, I will promote it to a real main blog post of its own  :-)\n\nThank you!\n\

  body: Thanks Jeremy.  Is there a way to actually draw filled regions by importing
    coordinates? A script which automatically creates filled regions from outside
    data?

    Yes, you would use the static FilledRegion.Create method.

    Any way to "tag" the area of a filled region?  Maybe by using a piece of text
    or generic annotation that gets the area pushed into it?'

    You tell us exactly how to achieve it through the user interface, and we may be
    able to tell you how that can be automated.
