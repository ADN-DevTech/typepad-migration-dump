  body: 'I guess from this that it is not possible to set the tag type before creation
    of a tag. Is it even possible to find which tag type would be used?

    In a similar manner I would like to know which level type will be used for a new
    level because I need to know whether the elevation to be set should be Project
    or Shared. In fact I want to set the ProjectElevation but it is Read-Only.

    The workaround will be

    a) Create the new level

    b) Check the ProjectElevation value is what I need

    c) If not change the elevation so that the ProjectElevation is correct'

  body: 'Dear David,


    I am not sure that it is impossible to define the tag type before its creation,
    if it defined in a standard RFA file. You may be able to open the family file
    and both read and modify the default type to use. It might just mean opening an
    additional file in the background and manipulating that in addition to the project
    document that you may be more accustomed to be working in. Maybe there is even
    no need to save the modified library file to disk before reloading it. No guarantees,
    though.


    Another way to approach this issue is to use the manual regeneration option, insert
    the instance without caring exactly what type it is, modifying it after inserting
    it, and not regenerating between these two steps.


    I cannot really say anything about the levels, I have not looked at them from
    that point of view yet at all. If you really want to know that and have a concrete
    problem that you would like to solve, I would suggest submitting an ADN case so
    that we can have a look at it in more depth.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: "Dear Jude,\n\nThat should be pretty easy. In all cases that I know of, the\
    \ location point of the column family instance is in its center. You can access\
    \ it though the Location property, casting the value to a LocationPoint. There\
    \ are lots of samples of doing this on the blog. \n\nThere are various other ways.\
    \ That might be the simplest, though.\n\nCheers, Jeremy."

  body: I came to know that, tags are not rotating with all components because rotate
    with component property is associated only with curve based elements. Is there
    any way to force the tags (labels in tags) to rotate based on any imaginary angle
    found from the tagged element?

  body: 'Dear John,


    Thank you very much for your appreciation.


    Mostly, the API will only allow you to set up situations that can also be constructed
    manually through the UI somehow.


    Can you solve this task manually?


    One powerful API feature is the DMU, or Dynamic Model Update:


    <a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?q=revit+api+dmu">http://lmgtfy.com/?q=revit+api+dmu</a>


    Using that, you can align one element with another and ensure that it updates
    appropriately, as demonstrated, for example, by the Revit SDK DynamicModelUpdate
    sample.


    I hope this helps.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: 'Jeremy,


    Can you explain in detail what it would take to make the Element.ChangeTypeId(Document,
    ICollection<ElementId>), ElementId) command work on a set of tags instead of just
    one. I am trying to change multiple tags all at once to avoid regeneration, but
    I am not sure how to use that method. if I call it on a element it returns an
    error saying that it was expecting just one argument. what is the proper way to
    use this method? thank you'
