  body: 'Jeremy,


    By reading your explanation (very detailed by the way, thanks) I was thinking
    about the following scenario:


    - The user is working within Revit performing general commands

    - From time to time he stops and make Revit enter into an idle state for a moment

    - At this moment I expect Revit to fire the Idling event

    - My Revit plugin captures the idling event

    - It gets control of Revit and perform some process, say a quick select over some
    families and collect some parameter information (it should be quick)


    My questions in this scenario would be:


    1)How Revit will react if the user tries to fire some command during my idling
    process? Do I need to handle this possibility?


    2)Can I lock the Revit UI during this idling process?


    3)Any special Transaction management in this scenario?


    Regards.'

    \nI have no idea what the answer is, although I suspect that a lot of thought\
    \ and care has been given to these issues by Arnost and his colleagues as described\
    \ in \n\n<a href=\"http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2010/04/asynchronous-api-calls-and-idling.html\"\

    \nIf you want to write to the Revit database in your Idling handler, you have\
    \ to open a transaction. That will probably lock Revit and its UI in the manner\
    \ you intend.\n\nTry it out and let us know what you find out.\n\nCheers, Jeremy.\n\
