  body: Also note that TransactionGroup.Assimilate() will only add one entry to the
    Undo/Redo list (the group name) while TransactionGroup.Commit() will add one item
    to the Undo/Redo list for each Transaction in the group.

  body: Yes, that is how it appears, but it is not what happens technically. Transaction
    groups do not add anything to the Undo/Redo menu; only transactions can do that.
    So, if there are transactions in a group, they will all appear on the Undo list
    when they get committed. Then, when the group ends, it will either leave the items
    there in case the group gets committed, or it will remove (N-1) of them and merges
    their changes with the first transaction of the group, plus replaces the name
    of the one remaining item. This is just a technicality, but in case anyone wondered
    how it actually works, now he/she knows. :-)
