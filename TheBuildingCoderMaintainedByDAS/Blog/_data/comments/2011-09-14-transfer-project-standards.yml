    Use the View.SketchPlane property introduced in the Revit 2011 API.


    For an example, please refer to the PlaceAtPickedFaceWorkplane command presented
    by the Selections SDK sample.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    can you please show a sample how I can transfer complete walls with structures

    Thank you very much!

    Sorry, I do not have anything at hand right now, nor any time to explore.


    If you do, please share it with us and I will create a new post on this.


    The above should provide a usable starting point, and the good news is that the
    Revit 2012 API does provide all the tools you need to create the required compound
    layer structure.


    Thank you!


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    With Revit 2014 and 2015, is there an API which will help in doing Transfer Project
    Standards?

    Thanks

    update on API access for this tool?

    Glad to hear it sounds useful to you.


    Well, nothing that I present here is really a tool, just sample source code for
    you to create your own tools from.


    This should be pretty straightforward to migrate to Revit 2016, though.


    On second thoughts, looking more closely at the text, I notice that I included
    the code above in The Building Coder samples as an external command CmdCopyWallType.


    Therefore, it has been continually migrated every year, and the Revit 2015 version
    is provided in The Building Coder samples GitHub repository:


    <a href="https://github.com/jeremytammik/the_building_coder_samples">https://github.com/jeremytammik/the_building_coder_samples</a>


    The code shown above is thus available there, already migrated to Revit 2015,
    and all the intervening versions as well:


    <a href="https://github.com/jeremytammik/the_building_coder_samples/blob/master/BuildingCoder/BuildingCoder/CmdCopyWallType.cs">https://github.com/jeremytammik/the_building_coder_samples/blob/master/BuildingCoder/BuildingCoder/CmdCopyWallType.cs</a>


    As an added bonus, though, I went and tested the command for you.


    I discovered that the transaction was not nicely encapsulated in a using statement,
    as it should be, so I fixed that.


    I also discovered that a bug was introduced during the migration from Revit 2013
    to 2014. Apparently, this command was never tested in Revit 2014 and the error
    has been undetected since. So I fixed that as well.


    The updated version is release 2015.0.120.10:


    <a href="https://github.com/jeremytammik/the_building_coder_samples/releases/tag/2015.0.120.10">https://github.com/jeremytammik/the_building_coder_samples/releases/tag/2015.0.120.10</a>


    So there you are.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    Since I like your question and my answer so much, I promoted the whole thread
    to a new dedicated blog post:
