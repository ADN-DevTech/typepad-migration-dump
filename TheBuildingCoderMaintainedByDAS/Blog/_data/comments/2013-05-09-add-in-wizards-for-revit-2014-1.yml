  body: 'Jeremy,


    This is off topic to this post, but had a question for you regarding the API and
    weather something was possible.


    Do you have access to all parameters in the project, including calculated values,
    via the API? If not, which values do you have access to? Assuming you have access
    to a parameter, are you able to create a link between that parameter and another
    (via the API)? For example (assuming you have access to the area parameter of
    a room), could I create an addin that would allow me to pick an existing parameter,
    and create a direct link to a newly created parameter (of the same type) that
    would update if the existing parameter updated?'

  body: 'Dear David,


    Regarding access to parameters, please use RevitLookup and find out for yourself.


    Certainly, you can use the Dynamic Model Update DMU in an add-in to update the
    value of a parameter based on changes in another one.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: 'Dear Nik,


    Thank you for your confirmation and appreciation.


    I am using Win7 myself.


    I cannot fix it for Win8 until someone forces me to move there myself, so you
    will either have to do it yourself or find someone else to support you there.


    Please also note this updated version:

  body: 'Jeremy,


    Thanks for the template . . . I installed the files from the zip in the c# project
    template folder, edited the csproj file in notepad to change the revit.exe location
    to Revit 2014 instead of Revit Architecture 2014 (my company has the suite, perhaps
    this is the difference?) and it works perfectly.  Now I can start changing my
    macros to add ins!'

    Try searching in Revit Architecture instead of Revit Structure.


    Rooms are specific to architecture.

  body: "Dear Emil,\n\nThat sounds like a very strange problem, and your description\
    \ is rather strange as well.\n\nI have implemented and published samples of two\
    \ kinds of System.Windows.Forms Form instances: statically created in the IDE,\
    \ and dynamically created by code.\n\nExamples of dynamically created forms are\
    \ provided by the RoomEditorApp, in the GeoSnoop module:\n\n<a href=\"https://github.com/jeremytammik/RoomEditorApp/blob/master/RoomEditorApp/GeoSnoop.cs\"\
    >https://github.com/jeremytammik/RoomEditorApp/blob/master/RoomEditorApp/GeoSnoop.cs</a>\n\
    \nAlso by the ScheduleData add-in, in the DisplayScheduleData method in the discussion:\n\
    \n<a href=\"http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2012/05/the-schedule-api-and-access-to-schedule-data.html\"\
    >http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2012/05/the-schedule-api-and-access-to-schedule-data.html</a>\n\
    \nStatically defined forms are used e.g. in the BipChecker and PlaceInstances\
    \ samples:\n\n<a href=\"https://github.com/jeremytammik/BipChecker\">https://github.com/jeremytammik/BipChecker</a>\n\
    \  BuiltInParamsCheckerForm.cs(6):\n    public partial class BuiltInParamsCheckerForm\n\
    \      : Form\n\n<a href=\"https://github.com/jeremytammik/PlaceInstances\">https://github.com/jeremytammik/PlaceInstances</a>\
    \      \n  PlaceInstancesForm.cs(19):\n    public partial class PlaceInstancesForm\n\
    \      : Form\n\nCheers, Jeremy."

    No problem whatsoever.


    I''m glad you got it sorted.


    This explanation is much less strange than your problem description, thank God  :-)
