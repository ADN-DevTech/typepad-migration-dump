  body: 'Hi, Jeremy.

    Thanks for your regular post.

    I think you should mention one more disadvantage of DocumentChanged event and
    in my opinion the most significant: the event occurs after the document has changed
    and there are no any ways to cancel changes using the event. E.g. in your sample
    you ask question after ElevationView has created: "You just created an elevation
    view ''{0}''. Are you sure you want to do that?". And only one button: Close.
    That if I''m not sure? :) Although, I and you have already told about it many
    times;)


    Regards, Victor.'

    I've been trying but I find the Application.AddinID always returns a null.

    another point: I have the feeling, that Element.GetChangeTypeElementAddition()
    does not call the updater, in case an element is deleted previously and added
    again by UNDO.


    Would you consider this as a feature lack or a bug?

    Is it possible to have a DMU actived in a DocumentOpened Onstartup? It looks like

  body: 'Jeremy,


    I''m wanting to change a floor''s offset from level after it''s been created.  The
    DMU is allowing me to make this change as soon as the floor is created, which
    is at the start of the sketch.  However, I really need it to modify the element
    when the user finishes the sketch (so that the user can change the floor type).  Is
    there another event for finish sketch but before the transaction is finished?


    Thanks!'

  body: I found a way to do this using GetModifiedElementIds().  Works great for detecting
    if a user changes from one type to another after it's created, as well.  Thanks!

  body: 'Dear Anthony,


    Great, thank you for the query and the solution.


    You basically have two events on document modification: the read-only document
    modified event for synchronising or storing the info externally, and the DMU,
    dynamic model update, to store it in the model itself, within the same transaction.


    You might also have been able to continue making use of DMU, using a different,
    later, change priority.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: 'Hi Jeremy,


    I have a question about the Dynamic Model Updater.


    I need to track the change of some properties


    But some of the triggers do not work. For Example LENGTH or AREA. If I subscribe
    to change the properties of the length (or area) of the wall, then trigger not
    work


    this my code:


    ElementId paramId = new ElementId( BuiltInParameter.CURVE_ELEM_LENGTH);

    UpdaterRegistry.AddTrigger(_updaterId, doc, filter, Element.GetChangeTypeParameter(paramId));


    How do I catch the LENGHT property change event

    Any help


    Thanks!'

    Thank you for your very valid query.


    You are absolutely right, I''m afraid.


    Here is another example, an explanation, and a suggestion for working around the
    problem:


    <a href="http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api/instance-elevation-param-change-is-not-firing-updater/td-p/5502606">http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api/instance-elevation-param-change-is-not-firing-updater/td-p/5502606</a>


    Basically, the workaround is to simply use GetChangeTypeAny instead of GetChangeTypeParameter.


    Cheers, Jeremy.
