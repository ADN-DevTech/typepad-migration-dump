    How would one split walls into a per level basis. I am not finding anything in
    the api docs suitable. It is quite easy to do this in the interface. I''m using
    ra2014.


    Regards'

    I am glad that you are ware that this is easy in the user interface.


    As you know, you can split a wall into parts, and use the levels as part delimiters
    within each wall.


    You can do exactly the same programmatically as well.


    Look at these discussions demonstrating various aspects of dividing walls into
    parts programmatically:
