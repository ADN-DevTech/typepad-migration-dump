    \ useful addins to increase productivity at work.\nFor one idea I am working on\
    \ at the moment... I would like to set say the worksetID of one element say walls\
    \ to another worksetID, for example a room.\nIs this possible? \nFurther how do\
    \ I add to a collection all the elements within a room? I know how to add to a\
    \ collection all the bounding elements of a room, do I use a similar foreach loop\
    \ to do this?\nI appreciate any help or pointers you could give me."

    The above shows that the workset id can be read and set, so the answer appears
    to be yes.


    Regarding your second question, how about this?
