    Is it possible to get the camera zoom level through the API?  I see that I can
    get camera position, view direction and possibly FOV but how about zoom?'

    No, I am sorry to say that I do not believe that is possible right now, since
    I see an open wish list item for that functionality.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    From the question of Jeff above, it seems that it is possible to get the camera
    position, view direction and FOV. Is it possible to set these values using the
    API?


    Thanks,'

    Can you please tell me how I can get Rvt_TargetPos using api. Currently Revit
    View3D class gives me position, viewdirection and upvector. I need the target
    and FOV.'
