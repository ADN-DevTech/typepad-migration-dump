    Use the InsulationLiningBase.Thickness property on the pipe insulation class.


    How to access the pipe insulation is demonstrated here:

    Sure. A quick glance at the documentation will tell you so: look at the InsulationLiningBase.HostElementId
    property.

  body: 'Dear Jason,


    I am sorry to say that once an element has been deleted, there is no way to retrieve
    any information about it at all any longer, neither using the DocumentChanged
    event nor the dynamic model update DMU.


    So to achieve what you describe you would have to somehow retrieve and store this
    information before the deletion happens.


    This may possibly require you to retrieve and cache all duct insulation relationships
    in the entire model, and then determine from GetDeletedElementIds which of these
    were affected.


    I hope this helps.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    I have no idea. I would have to try it out. Have you tried simply deleting the
    pipe insulation element?
