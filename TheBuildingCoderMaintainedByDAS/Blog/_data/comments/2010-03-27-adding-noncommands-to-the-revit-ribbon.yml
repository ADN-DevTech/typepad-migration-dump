    I understand this post is from 2010, so I''m hoping for some new news. Specifically
    in regards to your first "P.S." -- is it now possible to dynamically add an element
    to the Ribbon Panel after IExternalApplication.OnStartup has already executed?'

    Thank you for your appreciation.


    I have lots of news on this topic for you.


    I will only mention the two most recent additions.


    The first discusses the exact same topic as above, which I would assume not to
    be of that much real-world interest:

    The second takes the issue much further to the more useful case of adding a real
    Revit external command button anywhere you like in the ribbon, at any time:


    <a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2014/07/moving-an-external-command-button-within-the-ribbon.html">http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2014/07/moving-an-external-command-button-within-the-ribbon.html</a>


    The button creation uses standard Revit API functionality, and then the .NET ribbon
    functionality is used to move it to a different location.


    The .NET part can be activated any time you like. The Revit API ribbon creation
    maybe not... try it out and let us know. Thank you.


    Cheers, Jeremy.
