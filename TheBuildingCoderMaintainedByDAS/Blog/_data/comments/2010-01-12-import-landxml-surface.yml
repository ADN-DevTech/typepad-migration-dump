  body: 'Happy New Year Jeremy!!!


    You are my king.... I was fighting with this issue for a long long time and you
    have saved me tons of my time. I really appreciate the help you provide us. It''s
    invaluable.....


    My proposal: Can we improve this by taking into account other info from the LandXML
    as the lines for the corridor model..... so we can upload the Civil 3D solution
    into Revit ....

    Thanks a lot in advance.


    Cheers, Ramon.'

  body: 'Dear Ramon,


    Thank you for the appreciation and Happy New Year to you too, rather belatedly,
    and sorry for the late answer.


    Sure you can improve this ... you can see above how certain nodes in the LandXML
    file are accessed and that information is extracted to be passed into the Revit
    API creation method. Obviously, all other information in the LandXML file can
    be accessed as well, and all other creation methods provided by the Revit API
    can be fed with the appropriate extracted information.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: 'Dear Mark,


    I suggest that you learn the basics of the Revit API to sort this out. Download
    the Revit SDK, look at Chapter 2, Walkthroughs, and work through the DevTV recordings.
    All of this is available on the Revit Developer Center:


    <a href="http://www.autodesk.com/developrevit">http://www.autodesk.com/developrevit</a>


    I cannot check this on 64 bit right now. Can you try it out on 32 bit your end?


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: 'Dear Sherif,


    One possibility is to choose an arbitrary XY point which lies vertically below
    or above the surface and shoot a vertical ray through the surface using FindReferencesByDirection
    to find the corresponding Z coordinate.


    This has been used e.g. to place detail component family instances such as trees,
    c.f.

    I do not believe that is currently possible through the API. Sorry about that.
    I noticed you also submitted a ADN DevHelp Online case about this. If you would
    like to submit a wish list item for this functionality, please update that and
    let us know. Thank you!

    I want to create  TopographySurface that has a shape of concave polygon. With
    the Method NewTopographySurface i can only create TopographySurface that has a
    shape of Convex polygon.

  body: 'Dear Habib,


    Yes, of course, the method just takes a list of points and does not provide any
    way to specify that some of the possible triangles spanned by them should not
    be populated, so the resulting shape will always be convex when projected onto
    the 2D plane.


    Currently I see no way to create a concave shape.


    Stay tuned for improvements in this area, though.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'
