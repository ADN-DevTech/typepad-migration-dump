  body: 'Dear Thorsten,


    You are absolutely right!


    Thank you for pointing that out!


    I do not agree that it makes it harder to write at all, nor necessarily harder
    to read.


    It definitely has the really huge advantage of total language independence.


    I am pretty sure that all of the parameters referenced above are available through
    built-in parameters as well.


    Anyone willing to check and update the code?


    Thank you!


    Cheers, Jeremy.
