  body: 'What a stunning post Jeremy.


    You have answered some of the things that I have struggled with in Subscribing
    and unsubscribing from Revit events when building Family Browser.


    Now back to my code lol.

    Thanks a lot for your posts!

    I''ve read almost all your posts about modeless forms, idling event and async
    API calls and understand that I must make a lot of changes in my project.


    Thanks, Victor.'

  body: 'Hello, Jeremy.


    Another question about Idling and safe using Revit API.

    I have a modeless window. In this window I have command for open family. I use
    UIApplication.OpenAndActivateDocument method to open a family.

    |Window is modeless. So I''ve decided to use Idling event for safe call Revit
    API methods.

    But when I try to use this method in Idling event I get InvalidOperationException:
    Cannot open a UI Document when executing an event.


    If I''ll save global variable UIApplication (for example in Application.OnStartup)
    and will use it in modeless form - is it a good and safe method or not?


    Thanks, Victor'

    Today I''ve found one more problem with Idling event.


    When application subscribed to Idling event Revit process increase processor load
    up to 25% even there is no code in OnIdling Event handler.


    Code is here: <a href="http://pastebin.com/NkEg6cTv">http://pastebin.com/NkEg6cTv</a>


    VS solution with example here: <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/62538318/Revit/IdlingSample.zip">http://dl.dropbox.com/u/62538318/Revit/IdlingSample.zip</a>


    Also I''ve recorded video sample to demonstrate it: <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/62538318/Revit/ScreenCapture_20.02.2012%2012.05.37.wmv">http://dl.dropbox.com/u/62538318/Revit/ScreenCapture_20.02.2012%2012.05.37.wmv</a>


    Is it normal?


    In my opinion it is serious reason not to use Idling event.

    What do you think, Jeremy?


    Best regards, Victor'

  body: 'Dear Victor,


    This is a known issue and is being addressed. Thank you for pointing it out. The
    best advice I can give at the moment is to use the Idling event sparingly and
    only when needed, and unsubscribe from it immediately when it is not required.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    Yes, the UIApplication is always the same. The safest thing to do is read all
    of Arnost''s comments on this topic. I asked the same thing once, and he replied
    to that, and I posted it somewhere.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    Thank you for the appreciation. I am glad it is useful.


    What you observe is absolutely expected.


    The Revit API is disabled in perspective views:
