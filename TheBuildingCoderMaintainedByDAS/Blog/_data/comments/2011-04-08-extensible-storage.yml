  body: 'Jeremy,


    How do you suggest handling "Revisions" to Extensible Storage Schema(s)?


    For example, if my application uses a schema with 3 fields originally, but later
    discover I need a 4th field.


    From my experience, if I add the 4th field to my schema, the existing schemas
    applied to Revit elements are not recognized as being equal to the "Revised" schema.


    Is there a built in way to handle this? Or would I need to keep track of the schema
    "Versions" in order to compare when needed?


    Thanks,


    Jon Albert'

  body: 'Dear Jon,


    Thank you for a great question!


    That will definitely be a topic of my AU class on extensible storage.


    The second version of the schema would actually have to be defined as a new schema
    with a separate GUID.


    In the application making use of the data, you could implement support for both
    versions of the schema, and also automatically update from version 1 to version
    2, if you like.


    So the answer is basically ''yes, you would''.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    That is basically what I had in mind. Hopefully I will not have this situation
    for some time, but definitely good to keep in mind when defining schema(s).


    I look forward to attending you class(s) at AU!

    Great minds think alike, and sometimes small ones like mine as well  :-)


    Looking forward to seeing you there and hearing how it goes for you. Though you
    will almost certainly know more about it than I do by then  :-)


    Cheers, Jeremy'

  body: 'Dear Williams,


    Hola, que tal.


    Yes, sure it is possible to attach a URL to Revit elements by storing them as
    a string in extensible storage.


    You can use the code provided above to achieve this.


    Simply define a field of type string instead of XYZ.


    Cheers, Jeremy.
