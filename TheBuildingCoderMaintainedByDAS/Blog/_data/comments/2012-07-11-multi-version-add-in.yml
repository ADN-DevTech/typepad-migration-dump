  body: "Hi Jeremy,\n\nI am trying to create a dll that contains various things like\
    \ license checking ie. things non specific to Revit. \n\nWhen I reference the\
    \ dll into my Revit app and start it up it always fails with \"could not load\
    \ file or assembly etc.\". I have tried numerous approaches with copy local true\
    \ and false, setting full paths, etc. I'm out of ideas.\n\nDo you have any suggestions\
    \ about what I may be doing wrong or what I need to do to make sure it will load?"

  body: "Dear Andreas, \n\nNope, sorry, nothing comes to mind off-hand. Google?  :-)\n\
    \nOf course you must check the assembly dependencies.\n\nAh, I think I know what\
    \ I would try: open your assembly in Reflector. It should complain in exactly\
    \ the same way as Revit does, once you have loaded and opened RevitAPI.dll and\
    \ RevitAPIUI.dll in it.\n\n<a href=\"http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2010/02/kean-on-reflector.html\"\
