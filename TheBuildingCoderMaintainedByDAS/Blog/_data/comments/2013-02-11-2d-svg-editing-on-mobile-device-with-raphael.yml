    that svg stuff stimulates many other ideas.

    For example, one could place new FamilyInstances or add markups this way...


    What about making the user''s modifications persistent ?


    If you can get the current transformations of your objects, you could store them
    in a DB, reading them again if the user logs in another time...

    User could save a bunch of variants.



    Best regards,

    Rudolf'

  body: 'Hi Jeremy definately keen to see how you move forward translating the Revit
    representations to SVG!!


    I''ve done a little with this and the different ways objects are represented caused
    me some headaches.

    I will be very interested to see how you progress.
