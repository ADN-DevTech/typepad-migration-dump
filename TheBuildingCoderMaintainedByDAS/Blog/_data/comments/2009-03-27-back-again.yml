  body: 'Dear Michael,


    Thank you for your appreciation!


    There are indeed a large number of new elements exposed, but they are mostly centered
    around certain new API areas such as the family creation and complex modelling.


    I do not believe that anything has been added to provide access to view filters.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'
