  body: 'Hi Jeremy,


    what about SharpDevelop, is this platform supported, too ?


    Since Revit''s Macro Editor has been switched from VSTA to SharpDevelop, it would
    be strange if Autodesk wouldn''t support this platform *officially*.


    See you,

    Rudi'

    VS 2013 for Revit not to crash with "Problem Event Name: APPCRASH" on startup.
    Thanks for the clue.'

    Adding DebugEngines tag worked for me.

    Thanks for helping me out (once again).

    I have a colleague who stands to be a Revit (BIM) expert,

    but he was unable to get Revit 2014 + VS2013 bundle working on my PC.


    Jeremy, YOU are the real Revit expert!


    Kudos'
