    After getting the analytical model from the BoundaryConditions instance, you can
    call AnalyticalModel.GetElementId() method to retrieve the id of  the Host element
    family instance.

    It looks to me as if you will have to create it from the code above.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: 'Hey Jeremy,


    I''m trying to obtain the preview image from the families that have instance in
    my project. I used a bit of your code and a bit of the code on this site  - <a
    href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/aec/2012/09/accessing-the-path-a-revit-family-document-from-the-family-instance.html">http://adndevblog.typepad.com/aec/2012/09/accessing-the-path-a-revit-family-document-from-the-family-instance.html</a>
    - to get to the view and then I can export as image file. But I''m trying to do
    this in a faster way. I don''t want open every document instance using the AEC
    DevBlog sample - it''s slow. Does the RVT have this thumbnails somewhere? From
    where Revit use this image? It is a Raster Image element? Is this even an element
    at all that I can locate and use?


    Thanks in advance.'

  body: 'Dear Israel,


    The preview image of a family is officially available through the Revit API:

    You can also access the thumbnail directly through the appropriate OLE Open Document
    Storage stream:
