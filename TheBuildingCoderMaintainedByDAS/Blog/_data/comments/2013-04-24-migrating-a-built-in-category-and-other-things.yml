  body: You say you can reload a DXF Link via RevitLinkType.Reload() (or LoadFrom())
    but how do you cast from CADLinkType to RevitLinkType?

  body: 'Dear Haks,


    I do not see how you can cast from one to the other.


    These two classes are siblings, both derived from Autodesk.Revit.DB.ElementType.


    Therefore, you cannot cast from one to the other. All they share in common are
    the base ElementType members.


    Cheers, Jeremy.
