  body: 'Hi,


    I am using the 2014 SDK''s Revit::IFC::Export::Utility::GUIDUtil::CreateGUID method
    to create IFCGuid for an element, but it always throws an nullargument exception
    ... any ideas on that ?


    Thank you.'

  body: Is the ID unique across multiple installations of revit in multiple firms.
    We have a situation where 5 firms are generating content and it will eventually
    be merged into one IFC data set. What are the chances that there will be duplicate
    ID's?

  body: I need some clarification on exactly what the IFC GUID is; is it simply a
    link the the bsDD or does it contain information on the BIM object that it's referencing?

  body: "Dear Megan,\n\nFirst of all, thank you for submitting your question here\
    \ as a comment for all to share and participate in, instead of a private email\
    \ message.\n\nI do not know what you mean by bsDD.\n\nStrictly speaking, Revit\
    \ has no such thing as an IFC GUID.\n\nEach Revit element is always equipped with\
    \ two identifiers, the element id and the unique id. A third identifier for exporting\
    \ the element to other file formats can be generated by the ExportUtils.GetExportId\
    \ method. That is what we referred to as IFC GUID above.\n\nThe Revit element\
    \ unique id uniquely identifies the building element across all projects and models.\
    \ The unique id consists of a standard GUID plus an additional so-called epoch\
    \ id.\n\nThe element id is a simple integer number and is only unique within the\
    \ individual project file. \n\nThe export id or IFC GUID maps to the Revit element\
    \ unique id and also uniquely references the building element. It is not identical\
    \ to the unique id, though.\n\nI hope this clarifies.\n\nFor further information\
    \ and how to convert between these formats, please refer to the discussion above\
    \ and the links it contains.\n\nCheers, Jeremy."

  body: 'Dear Shaun,


    Sorry for the late answer.


    The chances of duplicate ids are almost if not exactly zero, as far as I know,
    for all elements that are newly generated.


    The only danger that can arise is if these companies copy files back and forth
    and start new projects based on files that already contain some elements. Those
    elements would obviously have the same unique ids.


    I hope this clarifies.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    Sorry for the late answer.


    I would suggest debugging the method in question and exploring exactly what happens
    interactively in the debugger.


    That should show you what object is causing the problem right away.


    Cheers, Jeremy.
