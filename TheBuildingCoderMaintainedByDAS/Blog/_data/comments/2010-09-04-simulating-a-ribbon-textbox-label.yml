  body: 'TextBox class looks like limited. I can''t enter special characters like
    "{}<>


    Is Some way to do this? Main reason it''s enter length in feet... or angle.


    Looks like now only with pop-up window work.'

  body: 'Dear Zhu XiaoMeng,


    Unfortunately, the Revit API does still not provide any access whatsoever to schedules,
    with the sole exception of electrical panel schedules.


    Access to the latter was added in the Revit 2011 API and is demonstrated by the
    PanelSchedule SDK sample that you mention:


    http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2010/05/the-revit-mep-2011-api.html


    Other schedules are not accessible programmatically, however.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: 'Dear Ruslan,


    Just as you say, the ribbon TextBox class currently limits the characters that
    can be input as you describe. We have an open wish list item to have this restriction
    removed. The workaround would be as you say, to display your own form and use
    a standard .NET input control there.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: "Hi Jeremy,\n\nI am a beginner in Revit API and I have a problem with Ribbon\
    \ TextBoxes. I want the ability to enter a value in a TextBox, placed in a Ribbon\
    \ I created myself (when the program starts up), and when enter is pressed, this\
    \ value is written to a ProjectInfo Parameter (which exists, and the entered value\
    \ is the correct format for the parameter). I use this command to call a function\
    \ when enter is pressed:\n\ntBox1.EnterPressed += new EventHandler(ProcessTextToutside);\n\
    \nand this is the function:\n\n        public void ProcessTextToutside(object\
    \ sender, Autodesk.Revit.UI.Events.TextBoxEnterPressedEventArgs args)\n      \
    \  {\n            // cast sender as TextBox to retrieve text value\n         \
    \   TextBox textBox = sender as TextBox;\n            String s = textBox.Value\
    \ as string;\n            Parameter ToutsideP = args.Application.ActiveUIDocument.Document.ProjectInformation.get_Parameter(\"\
    test\");\n            ToutsideP.Set(double.Parse(s));\n        }\n\nfor a very\
    \ strange reason, the Parameter.Set() doesn't work in this case, even though the\
    \ parameter can be called, and it's not readonly. Do you have any idea how to\
    \ fix this problem?\n\nThanks and kind regards!!\n\nJan"

  body: "Dear Jan,\n\nThe text box in the ribbon is displayed at all times, and thus\
    \ is comparable to a modeless dialogue.\n\nIf you have followed this blog for\
    \ a while, you will have noticed that use of the Revit API from a modeless context\
    \ is a bit special.\n\nThe Revit API can only be used within certain callback\
    \ contexts, i.e. Revit has to call you to let you know that it is now ok to use\
    \ the API.\n\nMy initial assumption from your description is that you just need\
    \ to open a transaction on the document containing the parameter you wish to change.\
    \ \n\nHave you tried doing that?\n\nFor instance, something like this:\n\npublic\
    \ void ProcessTextToutside(\n  object sender, \n  TextBoxEnterPressedEventArgs\
    \ args ) \n{ \n  TextBox textBox = sender as TextBox; \n  string s = textBox.Value\
    \ as string; \n  Document doc = args.Application.ActiveUIDocument.Document;\n\
    \  Transaction t = new Transaction( doc );\n  t.Start( \"Set Parameter\" );\n\
    \  Parameter p = doc.ProjectInformation.get_Parameter( \"test\" ); \n  p.Set(\
    \ double.Parse( s ) ); \n  t.Commit();\n} \n\nCheers, Jeremy."

    I can create a textbox on Ribbonpanel. How can I get the value from another class,

    Simply create a public property or method on the class providing the value, and
    call that from the method making use of it.
