    Another great post.  Do you think I could implement something similar for the
    duplicate instances notification?  I would like to automatically remove the second
    instance, which requires you to click on a + to expand the list of duplicate instances
    and then check the one you want to delete and then click on delete.  I am going
    to look into this too but wondered if you had ran across anything like this.

  body: 'Dear Joel,


    I''m very glad you like it, so do it. One of my favourites posts lately :-)


    I expect you can use it for the situation you describe as well. I developed the
    code above for exploration purposes while searching for the solution, so if you
    just remove the lines dealing with the isConfirm variable, or set it to a constant
    false value, the whole thing is reduced to a dialogue event logging system.


    You could probably also use the Revit SDK EventsMonitor sample to monitor the
    dialogue events. Oh no, I just checked, and it does not handle the DialogBoxShowing  event.
    Well, then you are stuck with my contribution above.


    If you like, please keep your solution minimal and completely generic when you
    implement it and send it to me afterwards, and I''ll post it as well  :-)


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    I also remember a developer support case concerning this issue. Looking a bit\
    \ closer, I discover that the case was raised by Mr. Dan Tartaglia  :-)\n\nSo\
    \ you know all about it. I see there that we found no support for your needs in\
    \ the Revit API, and I don't know how to achieve it using the Windows API, though\
    \ I do believe it is possible, and probably not very hard if you just know the\
    \ optimal approach. Sorry.\n\nCheers, Jeremy."

    I want to hook onto the Save As dialog, cancel it, get the revit Document object
