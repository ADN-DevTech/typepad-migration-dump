  body: 'Hi Jeremy,


    Thanks a lot for the great information resource you''re providing. I''ve just
    started working on integrating Revit with an external DB (ultimately MS Sharepoint)for
    facilities management applications. Can you give an update of what would you change
    in this post with the new features of Revit API if you wanted to write about the
    same subject?


    Best,


    Hamid'

    Thank you for your appreciation, it is a pleasure.


    Sounds like a good and useful project.


    Nothing significant has changed, really, afaik all the above still applies.
