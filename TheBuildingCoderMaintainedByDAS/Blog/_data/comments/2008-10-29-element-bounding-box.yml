    \ related question using the View Outline instead of the BoundingBox property\
    \ on\n\n<a href=\"http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2009/01/viewports-and-sheets.html\"\
    >http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2009/01/viewports-and-sheets.html</a>\n\
    \nSo I will take a closer look at your question there now.\n\nCheers, Jeremy."

  body: Thanks for the article.  Its helps explain a longtime issue with copy monitor.  When
    CM copies a wall, it creates an opening based on the bounding box of a window
    or door.  The BB of the window is set at the farthest element in the family, making
    the created opening wildly inaccurate.  Can an addin be created to reset the BB
    in a family to the rougb opening type parameters?  Autodesk refuses to fix tbis
    issue and many engineers would love an addin like this

  body: 'Dear Larry,


    Thank you for your appreciation. I am glad it helps.


    I am also sure that Autodesk is not refusing to fix anything, just that the right
    people are not aware of the issue and its ramifications. Have you reported this
    issue to product support, and ensured that they return back to you either with
    a solution that satisfies your needs, an explanation of how you can solve it better,
    or a database entry number for the request to have it fixed? If not, please do.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    \ link(.rvt proj file), say the mass category for eg. Is it possible to access\
