  body: 'Hi Jeremy!


    Thanks for the exposition, those are very good points.


    Concerning unnecessary conversions, note that in the case of IEnumerable<Element>
    there''s no copying and duplication involved. Linq''s Cast extension is just a
    wrapper replacing the built-in IEnumerator<Element>.


    Of course it has a slight performance loss too, but if you want to write in a
    functional style, this would be the way around the imperative foreach.'

  body: "Hello everybody.\n\nWhy doesn't anyone use <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/twcad0zb(v=vs.100).aspx\"\
    >Generic methods</a>?\nFor example, the method <i>FindElement</i> would looks\
    \ like\n<i>\npublic static Element FindElement<T>(\n    Document doc,    \n  \
    \  string targetName )\n  {\n    //...\n        collector.WherePasses( \n    \
    \  new ElementClassFilter( typeof(T) ) );\n    //...\n  }\n</i>\nThe code looks\
    \ pretty elegant and using it more simple.\n\nFor FilteredElementCollector.OfClass\
    \ method I wrote a simple extension method to use generic.\n<i>\npublic static\
    \ FilteredElementCollector OfClass<TElement>(this FilteredElementCollector collector)\
    \ where TElement : Element\n        {\n            return collector.OfClass(typeof(TElement));\n\
    \        }\n</i>\nIt seems to me more convenient to write <i>collector.OfClass<Family></i>\
    \ instead of <i>collector.OfClass(typeof (FamilySymbol))</i>\n\nHave a nice day,\n\

    Sorry. The parser has eaten angle brackets.

    The right code is here <a href="http://pastebin.com/Y4P3sysc">http://pastebin.com/Y4P3sysc</a>'

  body: "Dear Victor,\n\nYes, a bit more convenient...\n\nAlthough it is inconvenient\
    \ that (i) the angle brackets are 'more special' than parentheses, and thus get\
    \ involuntarily eaten or otherwise mistreated at times, and (ii) this requires\
    \ me to drag around that extension method all the time, whereas the original version\
    \ is available right there out of the box.\n\nWhat I would love to know, and unsuccessfully\
    \ tried to find out, is how to implement a templated member method in a non-templated\
    \ class definition, e.g.\n\nclass MyClass\n{\n  void f[T]() {...}\n}\n\n(where\
    \ I am using square instead of angle brackets).\n\nDo you have any idea?\n\nAs\
    \ far as I can tell from my research, it is not supported by C# at all.\n\nI have\
    \ repeatedly run into situations where I was forced to implement almost identical\
    \ member methods several times over, taking different argument types.\n\nI would\
    \ have loved to create a template for those.\n\nCheers, Jeremy."
