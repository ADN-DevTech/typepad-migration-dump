  body: "Hi JEREMY, I'm a Chinese architect. Here is my question: When a structural\
    \ column intersect an architectural wall, they can't join together automatically.\
    \ And in elevation view, there're no intersection lines appear(Specifically refers\
    \ to cylinder column). So I hope to use Revit API to join structural column and\
    \ architectural wall, or to join beam/slab and wall. But I can't find the right\
    \ method. Can I achieve this function? \nThank you!    celticblue"

  body: "Dear Celticblue,\n\nI do not believe you can, I'm afraid. \n\nThe only joining\
    \ control I am aware of is through the new Revit 2012 WallUtils class and its\
    \ methods DisallowWallJoinAtEnd, AllowWallJoinAtEnd and IsWallJoinAllowedAtEnd.\n\
    \nThey provide access to the setting for whether or not joining is allowed at\
    \ a particular end of the wall. If joins exist at the end of a wall and joins\
    \ are disallowed, the walls will become disjoint. If joins are disallowed for\
    \ the end of the wall, and then the setting is toggled to allow the joins, the\
    \ wall will automatically join to its neighbors if there are any.\n\nAll other\
    \ joining in Revit is automatic, I believe.\n\nIf you can affect the behaviour\
    \ through the user interface, then there is a chance that you can do it programmatically\
    \ as well, so I suggest exploring it in the UI first.\n\nCheers, Jeremy."
