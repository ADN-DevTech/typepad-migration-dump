  body: "Thanks, this was incredibly useful regarding adding Parameters to ModelGroups\

    \ like to add parameters to a Group such as \"Name\", \"Breakline\", etc. Is there\
    \ any other way to group elements (FamilyInstances) in my case in a manor that\

    "You can easily create your own user interface to modify these properties, even
    if Revit considers that they should be hidden from the user."


    Thats sounds like a solution I''ll try. What would be even better is when the
    user selects the ModelGroup it will open my user interface that lists all the
    (hidden) parameters that ModelGroup has. Do you think this is possible? Maybe
    I can register for mouse click events? I''ve seen your post about hooking but
    that would be my last resort. I''d rather register my callback for Revit events
    as opposed to every mouse click.'

    Yes, that is possible. I cannot say how it would affect performance, though. Here
    is an example of an add-in that continually monitors and displays the contents
    of the current Revit selection set:
