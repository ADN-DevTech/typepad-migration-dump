    You can use a filtered element collector. This blog is full of samples of using
    it, as is the Revit SDK sample collection. Please help yourself.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: "Dear Jaime,\n\nThank you very much for your appreciation!\n\nHmm, do you\
    \ mean you have a Revit add-in which defines an external command and you wish\
    \ to launch that command? \n\nWell, simply registering it in the add-in manifest\
    \ will automatically add an entry to the Revit external tools menu to launch it.\
    \ \n\nIf you prefer to define your own button to launch it, you can implement\
    \ an external application to do so. \n\nThis is all covered in the getting started\
    \ materials:\n\n<a href=\"http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2011/10/getting-started-with-the-revit-2012-api.html\"\

    \nAh, no, you mean a keyboard shortcut? Hmm. Yes, I believe that is possible.\
    \ Ask a product usage expert  :-)\n\nCheers, Jeremy."

    I''m having trouble setting up a thread to call Execute. And I cannot get SendKeys

    together? Thank you!'

  body: 'Dear Bryan,


    It is a pleasure, and thank you for your appreciation!


    To learn how to call Execute, work through the getting started material:


    <a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2011/10/getting-started-with-the-revit-2012-api.html">http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2011/10/getting-started-with-the-revit-2012-api.html</a>


    Regarding getting SendKeys to work, I recommend that you simply forget about it.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: 'Hi Jeremy,


    I have googled to try to find an alternative to closing the active document with
    the use of sendwait method and I haven''t found a suitable alternative. The sendwait
    method actually works except if I start a new RVT file and run my addin that it
    simply does nothing.

    I am attempting a different approach now and that is to switch the active doc
    to the other or non active doc opened in the same session. I haven''t discovered
    any solution so far. Do you know if it is possible and if so do you know of a
    method that i should implement?

    cheers,

    Alex.'

  body: 'Dear Alex,


    I am glad to hear that you have had some partial success, at least.


    Have you looked at this other approach as well?


    <a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2012/12/closing-the-active-document.html">http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2012/12/closing-the-active-document.html</a>


    It sounds similar to what you suggest and used to work reliably, as far as I know.


    Please let us know what solution you end up with.


    Thank you!


    Cheers, Jeremy.
