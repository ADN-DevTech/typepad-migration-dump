    All that travelling around Italy sounds terrible ;-) I would have thought there
    wouldn''t have been too many tourists at this time of the year? Lucky you''re
    not doing the training in summer...


    Enjoying your frantic pace of posting, don''t know how you find the time.

    That is a great little improvement, thank you very much for the suggestion!


    I''ll add a note on this to the post itself and update the source code as well.


    Terrible indeed  :-)  I may be going back again for vacation in March, to continue
    hacking those many grammatical suffixes ... La donna e stata molta sincera ...
    L’uomo e stato molto sincero ... almost every word in each sentence adapts to
    some other word ... not too complex, but takes a lot of practice to get your brain
    to automate the processing and not require two or more passes before uttering
    a sentence.


    I guess I just don''t sleep any longer ...


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    Thank you very much for your appreciation.


    Yes, sure you can export from Revit to Navisworks. I googled for "navisworks revit",
    and the first hit that turned up is a description of a Revit to Navisworks workflow
    which might fit your needs:

    There are lots more, as well.

    I do not understand the question in your first comment, on the threads. Regarding
    the modeless dialogue box, you can hide it if you like and then redisplay it again
    using the Hide and Show methods.

    I''m very glad that you can access the journal file and the last command. I''m
    afraid I don''t know what the problem is with the SendKeys method. I have not
    been able to get it to run on 2010 either. Sorry about that! Are you talking about
    2009 or 2010?

    It sounds as if you are trying to implement a modeless form. For a clean solution
    to that, please refer to

    Grazie :-)


    The above deals with associating the modeless form with the Revit main window.
    If you do that, they collapse and restore together, etc. If you do not associate
    them, they remain completely independent, e.g. collapsing Revit will not affect
    the modeless form.
