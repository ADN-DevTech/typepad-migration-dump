    \ that there is a Revit API wish list on AUGI:\n\n<a href=\"http://forums.augi.com/showthread.php?t=28520\"\
    >http://forums.augi.com/showthread.php?t=28520</a>\n\nTo submit a wish list item\
    \ directly to the Autodesk Revit development team, I suggest that you wait until\
    \ the next official API Wish List Survey is announced.\n\nCheers, Jeremy.\n-----"
