    Indeed Britanny is beautiful, I live there !


    I have a question about the API : I''ve determined translation and rotations parameters
    through a least square method, but the rotations are calculated considering they
    will be applied from the (0,0,0) point. But when I apply them with ElementTransformUtils.RotateElement
    it seems they are not applied from that point. I tried to change my least square
    treatment to consider the survey point as the (0,0,0) point but I still got small
    errors. Any ideas how to apply them from (0,0,0) ?

    Wow, how nice, luck you. I love Brittany!


    You are forced to specify a rotation axis when you call the ElementTransformUtils.RotateElements
    method.


    That axis will always determine the axis of rotation, including the center point
    of the rotation, so it should give you absolutely all you need.


    What axis are you specifying?


    To rotate in the XY plane around the origin, you can use a line from the origin,
    (0,0,0) = XYZ.Zero, to an arbitrary point on the Z axis, e.g. (0,0,1) = XYZ.BasisZ.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: "Dear Jeremy\n\nWhat I do is this :\n            Line axeX=Line.CreateBound(new\
    \ XYZ(0,0,0),new XYZ(1,0,0));\n            Line axeY = Line.CreateBound(new XYZ(0,\
    \ 0, 0), new XYZ(0, 1, 0));\n            Line axeZ = Line.CreateBound(new XYZ(0,\
    \ 0, 0), new XYZ(0, 0, 1));\n\nSo I guess it is what you suggested. I must have\
    \ a bug somewhere. I manage a workaround : I substract to all my data the coordinates\
    \ of my survey point. Still not the right point for me apparently but since the\
    \ angle is right I just have to apply new translation to fix it.\n\nThank you\
    \ for your answer\n\nJordi"

    \ use this instead:\n\n  Line axeX = Line.CreateBound( XYZ.Zero, XYZ.BasisX );\n\
    \  Line axeY = Line.CreateBound( XYZ.Zero, XYZ.BasisY );\n  Line axeZ = Line.CreateBound(\
    \ XYZ.Zero, XYZ.BasisZ );\n\nThe last one, axeZ, is the one I was thinking of,\
    \ yes.\n\nGlad to hear you have found a solution.\n\nYup, if you are working with\
    \ very large coordinates, it will indeed often help to move the whole problem\
    \ closer to the origin.\n\nCheers, Jeremy."

    Yup I tried that too but it gave me the exact same results.

    The workaround is good and my plugin works perfectly fine at the moment so I''m
    very glad. Thanks for all the help these past months, your blog is awesome. Keep
    it up !

    Yeah I did, it''s pretty nice. I fell for the april fools, I didn''t see the date.
    I was kind of exited then I was very disapointed. I''m a very gullible person
    !


    Cheers,
