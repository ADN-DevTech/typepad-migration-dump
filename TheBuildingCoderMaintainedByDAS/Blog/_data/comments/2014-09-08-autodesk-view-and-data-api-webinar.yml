  body: "I struggled with this for a bit before figuring this out.  You can determine\
    \ if an Electrical Equipment family is a Panel or Switchboard by accessing the\
    \ 'Part Type' information stored on the family.  \n\nFamilyInstance ee = e as\
    \ Autodesk.Revit.DB.FamilyInstance;\nFamilySymbol fs = ee.Symbol as Autodesk.Revit.DB.FamilySymbol;\n\
    \nFamily eeFamily = fs.Family;\n\neeFamily.get_Parameter(BuiltInParameter.FAMILY_CONTENT_PART_TYPE).AsInteger()\n\
    \n14 = Panelboard\n16 = Switchboard\n\nHope this helps,\n\nBen\n-----"
