  body: 'Dear Davex,


    Thank you for the confirmation and congratulations on figuring it out.


    Normally, the Revit SDK samples provide an example of using these kind of methods,
    so that is always one of the first places one should look when in doubt.


    Unfortunately, this one is an exception.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: 'Tried this, but it filed to cooperate with my SS01 pipe spec. Tri clamp fittings
    we not able to connect. Concentric reducers also failed to connect. Great tool
    for "generic pipe system", but is there a way to make the behave with all pipe
    specs? Including the victallic spec?
