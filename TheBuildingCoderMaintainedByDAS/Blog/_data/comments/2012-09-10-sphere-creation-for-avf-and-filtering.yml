  body: 'Hi Jeremy,


    nice to see that you are planning to use Kean''s web service.


    One thought:

    In contrary to AutoCAD, there are length limitations that one must have in mind
    when creating geometrical objects.

    So it may be that you cannot create too tiny spheres; also, it may happen that
    you cannot create the lines and arcs which you need for the rotation operation.

    And so on...



    Cheers,

    Rudolf'

    Thank you for the hint. Yes, I thought of that already. I''ll just have to make
    them really big, then.

    as far as I know, there is also an *upper* size limitation in Revit files.

    So please avoid to generate objects of planetary scale...

    I am tempted to treat you comment as a joke.


    Seriously speaking, just change the radius.

    Glad I could put a smile on your face... but if an object has been made, how can
    I use ScaleBasis to enlarge something?

    Please remember that Revit is not AutoCAD:


    <a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2012/02/bim-versus-free-geometry-and-product-training.html">http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2012/02/bim-versus-free-geometry-and-product-training.html</a>


    Forget TransformBy.


    Imagine scaling a wall by a factor of two. What happens? Its width doubles. What
    does that mean? It is no longer the same wall type. The neww required wall type
    does not even exist. Basically, forget scaling in Revit. You change the type,
    or you change the parameters. You do not scale.


    Of course, if you are working with pure geometrical objects, then you might be
    able to scale something. That is then purely abstract and has nothing to do with
    BIM elements or the real world.


    Best regards from AU in Las Vegas!


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: 'Jeremy,


    Its been a while, but I need to re-visit your balls!


    I take your point about AutoCAD and indeed I would not want to scale a family
    or other object.


    I need to scale a ''solid''/''GeometryElement'' for a bit of ''rough What-If''
    visual analysis...

    Sometimes its a complex shape, so I cant re-create the element (easily)


    Is there a way to scale up a soild from its ''center point'' or centroid?


    Ive been playing around with ScaleBasis and every time I apply it, the object
    moves as well!


    Cheers,

    Kon'

    Nope, sorry.


    I searched very hard for something similar:


    "It would be great if there was a possibility to grow the solid just slightly,
    e.g. offset all its faces outwards by an inch or two or define a tolerance before
    executing the intersection check, like for the bounding box. Unfortunately, growing
    or shrinking an arbitrary solid is much harder than a bounding box and therefore
    not implemented."


    Here are some of the alternatives that I explored:

    I normally never delete anything, just comment out the parts that I end up not
    using, so it should still be in there somewhere.

    No, the solid is in-memory only. It is not a Revit database element.
