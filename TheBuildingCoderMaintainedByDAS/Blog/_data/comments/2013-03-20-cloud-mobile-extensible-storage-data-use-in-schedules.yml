  body: "Hi Jeremy,\n\nI read your blog, and i wondered about this phrase:\n\n\\quote\n\
    Well, one tiny little detail more: if an element id value is stored, and the element\
    \ id is later modified by some worksharing operation, its value will be automatically\
    \ updated.\n\\unquote\n\nLets say i have linked my Revit model via DBlink for\
    \ Facility Management purposes. The Element ID field in de database is used to\
    \ distinguise one door from another(for example), and linked to another table\
    \ with exteral information about those doors.\n\nWhat actions on worksharing level\
    \ could corrupt my data in the database (the element ID), i've tried moving an\
    \ element from one workset to another but that doesnt change the element ID? \n\
    I just wondered...\n\nThnx in advance,\nMarcel"

    \ the element id, but the UniqueId instead.\n\nCheers, Jeremy. \n-----"
