    if we want to save CompundStructure? API Help tell about it:)


    Hope Balaji will help me in future with my silly or not questions:)

    I''m trying to get the faces of a especific layer (and then get the Reference
    Object), during a CompoundStructure iteration. Is there any way I can achieve
    that?


    Thanks in advance'

    Yup, I guess that is about the gist of it.


    I must say, I have yet to hear a silly question from you.


    And anyway, some people say that silly questions do not exist at ll.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: "Dear Israel,\n\nIf you want the reference to the face of a specific layer,\
    \ then that layer and its face must be database resident. \n\nYou could achieve\
    \ this by splitting the wall or floor or whatever into parts, as described in\
    \ \n\n<a href=\"http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2012/01/identifying-wall-compound-layers-and-parts.html\"\

    \nThe previous posts mentioned there discuss other ways of accessing wall layer\
    \ geometry without splitting it into parts.\n\nCheers, Jeremy."

    I do not believe there is any special reason for that, it is just a test sample.


    Here are some little core related discussions:

  body: I cannot get this to work either.  When I set it up to tell me what the new
    thickness (width) is, it tells me it is what I have set, but when the transaction
    is committed, the layers remain unchanged.
