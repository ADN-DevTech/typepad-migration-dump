    Thank you for the news! I am wondering whether you could please provide a little
    more insights on the IFC support? Does "IFC Document Open" means that it is possible
    to access the IFC objects in Revit API? Would it be possible to add new elements
    as IFC objects to the Revit project? Thank you very much!


    Best wishes,

    I''m experimenting with the extensible storage new feature right now. Could you
    give a quick synopsis on what the factory envisioned with this new feature. The
    factory does mention it was meant to be a substitute to using hidden shared parameters,
    but can this data be read from parameters in the family? Could this possibly allow
    us to embed a lookup table inside the family?


    thanks,

    No, I do not know in detail. I described some changes that are already visible

    The process of updating the material library is continuing in Revit 2012, and
    new Material classes are being introduced to replace the old ones.


    I cannot say how that will affect access to texture coordinates and FBX data,
    though.

  body: 'Dear Pine,


    Depending on how you read that, you will probably never be able to "access the
    IFC objects in Revit API", since the IFC objects are converted to native Revit
    objects on importing the file.


    "IFC Document Open" simply refers to the possibility to specify and load an IFC
    file into the Revit model through the API.


    Another IFC-related activity in Revit 2012 involves ensuring that all data in
    the Revit model required to implement the IFC export from Revit is fully accessible
    though the API.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    Yes, I am afraid it was. The extensible storage mechanism allows you to attach
    your own custom data to almost any Revit element, but this data is for your application
    use only, and not accessible through any other means such as formulas or parameters.


    A lookup table could be embedded, but you and  your add-in would be responsible
    for reading and evaluating it.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    No, I cannot provide any details.


    I can answer your question, however, a little bit. When you say "will be used
    to export the Revit objects", I assume that you are referring to the built-in
    Revit IFC export functionality. I do not expect there to be any additional control
    added to that.


    When I say that we are thinking about ensuring that the API has access to all
    model data required for the IFC exporrt, that means that it will be possible for
    you to implement your own IFC export from scratch. I do not know what will be
    done internally in Revit.


    I hope this clarifies.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    \ \nAccordingly,the change of analytical model in Revit 2012 is that class AnalyticalModel\
    \ is derived from Element class, instead of IDisposable interface. This means\
    \ in Revit 2012, AnalyticalModel instance is database resident. Previously, AnalyticalModel\
    \ instance lives in the memory. \n\nThis affect the way how we get analytical\
    \ model object. Now we can get them using element filtering mechanism via FilteredElementCollecotr.\
    \ Previously we get the analytical model from the host element.\n\nWith regard\
    \ to the functionality of AnalyticalModel class, new methods about alignment operation\
    \ is introduced. GetAlignmentMethod, HasAlighment and SetAlignmentMethod.\n\n\
    Alignment option should work for 2011 model opened in RST2012.\n\nHope this explains.\

    Do the CopyElement/CopyElements methods really exist in Revit API 2012? I also

    That is indeed the case, the active document cannot be closed.


    You''ll just have to keep one document active and not close it.


    For instance, you can even open a dummy document for that purpose to make it easier
    to keep track of it.


    Or you can use unsupported workarounds such as those described in
