  body: Very interesting. Very useful. I wonder, is it possible to loop through all
    types within a given .rfa file without loading the .rfa into the project? I see
    LoadFamilySymbol(rfafilename, typetoload) in the Revit SDK, but that assumes you
    know the name of the type you want to load. Can you first examine all of the types
    in the rfa file and then pick one to load? Sorry to bother you with this. I know
    your time is valuable.

    I am glad you find this useful! Thank you!


    Yes, I would say it is. When your command is active, you can use Application.OpenDocumentFile
    method to open the .rfa file and then use the Document.FamilyManager and FamilyManager.Types
    properties to iterate over its types without it ever being loaded into your current
    project, and even without your project ever being aware of the analysis your plug-in
    is performing.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: 'Dear Charlie,


    From your error message, I would guess that you are using Visual Basic. Is that
    correct?


    I always get that error in Visual Basic as well.


    Therefore, my first recommendation would be to use C# instead.


    If you prefer to stick with Basic anyway, then the only workaround that I am aware
    of is to not use the ''Imports'' statement locally in each module, but to import
    the namespaces that you wish to have accessible through the global Visual Basic
    project settings instead, i.e. through Solution Explorer > [project] > Properties
    > References > Imported namespaces. Then the namespaces will be imported globally
    for the entire project, into all modules. In my case, that has mostly resolved
    the problem. I hope it helps for you too.


    If anyone is aware of a better solution, I would love to hear about it!


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    Sure the Revit API can help; it always does; it is your good and trusty friend.


    It will help you especially well if you can achieve what you need manually, and
    wish to reduce that manual effort by automating the repetitive steps.


    Just identify those clearly and go ahead and automate them.


    It sounds to me as if you need to make your family more flexible, and possibly
    create new custom family definitions for the different location requirements.
    I am no content creation or family expert, though, by any means, so don''t ask
    me, please.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: 'Hi Jeremy,


    I know that this post is quite old, but I have some question regarding the nested
    families.

    We''ve found out that connectors (piping, electrical etc) of the nested families
    are "invisible" to the designers inside the project.

    So far we''ve managed to display nested family''s parameters inside the schedule
    and map some of them to the connector parameters, but these families are still
    quite useless, because they cannot be interconnected in a real-world project.

    Do you have any solution for that?

    Would you like to have a sample family to play with?


    Best regards,

    Yaroslav'

  body: 'Dear Yaroslav,


    The connectors do indeed become invisible in a certain way.


    In the family definition context, they are represented by individual elements.


    When the MEP fitting is inserted as a family instance into the project, the individual
    connector elements are assimilated into connector objects on the family instance
    element:


    <a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2009/04/mep-connectors.html">http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2009/04/mep-connectors.html</a>


    From then on, the connector objects are accessible via and managed by the ConnectorManager,
    a property of the FamilyInstance.MEPModel, which can be any one of ElectricalEquipment,
    LightingDevice, LightingFixture, MechanicalEquipment and MechanicalFitting.


    These objects and their properties are absolutely not useless, as demonstrated
    by the ADN MEP sample application AdnRme:


    <a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/about-the-author.html#5.40">http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/about-the-author.html#5.40</a>


    A pretty exhaustive example demonstrating various ways to connect MEP elements
    with each other is provided, for pipes at least, by the rolling offset add-in:


    http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2014/01/final-rolling-offset-using-pipecreate.html


    I hope this helps.


    Cheers, Jeremy.
