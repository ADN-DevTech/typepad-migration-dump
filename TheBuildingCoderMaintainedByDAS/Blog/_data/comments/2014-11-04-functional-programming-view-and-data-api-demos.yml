  body: 'Hey Jeremy,

    Thanks for providing these helpful links, and for having a look at my webpage!

    I''m definitely going to play a bit with this View API, as soon as I finish my
    Revit addin...(I''m not such a multitasker as you are I suppose..)


    Thanks again for all the good work.'

    My pleasure entirely, and best of luck to you exploring the view and data API!


    Come to one of the upcoming DevDays conferences to see much more of it live!


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: "Hi Jeremy,\n\nI am new to this blog and new to Revit API (SDK 2015), still\
    \ not really knowing what I am doing and struggling through the examples here\
    \ and in other places. \n\nThere are lots of useful examples and many of them\
    \ are based on using \"ElementSet\". so I create an element set, like \"ElementSet\
    \ elems = selection.Elements;\" Then I get a message saying \"don't use selection.elements,\
    \ it's deprecated, use GetElementIds() instead.\" Of course I want to be a good\
    \ guy, so I use \"GetElementIds()\", only to find out that this does not work\
    \ for \"ElementSet\".\n\nOkay, so I abandon \"ElementSet\" and use \"ICollection<ElementId>elems\"\
    \ which is (grammatically) fine -> no compiler errors. But now I have a Icollection\
    \ and all the loads of code which I had found in the web so far do not work for\
    \ me any more, as they were based on \"ElementSet\". \n\nSo here are my questions:\
    \ is there a way to cast/convert \"ICollection\" to \"ElementSet\"? Am I the first\
    \ one to come across this problem? What would be the professional approach to\
    \ deal with this ? \n\nMany thanks for you advice..."

  body: 'Dear Fimo,


    Thank you for a very valid question.


    ElementSet is obsolete in Revit 2015, just as the message tells you. The main
    change is this one, I guess:


    <a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2014/04/whats-new-in-the-revit-2015-api.html#2.10">http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2014/04/whats-new-in-the-revit-2015-api.html#2.10</a>


    However, as long as it has not been removed, you can still use it and ignore the
    warning.


    All new code should avoid making use of it, since it will probably no longer work
    (and be removed) in the next release.


    In most cases, you can replace it by a collection of ElementId objects. However,
    its are element ids and not Element instances, so there will be some differences
    in usage.


    That is the issue you are encountering. Basically, the old code needs to be rewritten
    to take the collection of ids instead of the set of elements.


    The Revit API used to define quite a number of custom collections.


    They are all being replaced by generic .NET collections, by and by.


    Also, a number of methods are now using ElementId arguments instead of straight
    Element ones.


    This is part of a multi-year transition.


    I hope this explains.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    \ stick to the obsolete variants in order to get some results. That means I am\

    \ conclusion from that is to learn the new style and convert to old snippets to\

    To motivate you further, and others as well, I hope, I published an edited version
    of our discussion:


    <a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2014/11/migrating-deprecated-api-and-2d-boolean-operations.html#3">http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2014/11/migrating-deprecated-api-and-2d-boolean-operations.html#3</a>


    I also did some further work myself removing compilation warnings about deprecated
    API usage from The Building Coder samples, to provide a perfect example to explain.


    I hope this helps.


    Cheers, Jeremy.
