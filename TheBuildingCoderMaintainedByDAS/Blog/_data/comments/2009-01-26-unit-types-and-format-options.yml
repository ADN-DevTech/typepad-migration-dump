  body: 'Jeremy, I am trying to add an area unit suffix of GSF (gross sq ft) to Revit
    Architecture, and am a complete API novice - these posts give me a glimmer of
    hope, but I''m still lacking basic direction. Any chance you can provide a layman''s
    summary, or point me towards a resource that would guide me through the process?

    Thanks in advance,'

  body: "Dear Nancy,\n\nI don't know what object you are trying to add the suffix\
    \ to, so I don't know exactly what process you mean. I probably cannot provide\
    \ much advice for a layman anyway, and certainly no advice whatsoever for Revit\
    \ users. I only deal with the Revit programming, and you probably know more about\
    \ driving Revit through the user interface than I do. \n\nIf you are trying to\
    \ add the suffix to some dimensioning, then that has to do with the dimensioning\
    \ enhancements made in Revit 2008 providing the ability to add text overrides\
    \ and text above, below, and as prefix or suffix to the dimension. Unfortunately,\
    \ there is currently no API access to that functionality.\n\nCheers, Jeremy.\n\
