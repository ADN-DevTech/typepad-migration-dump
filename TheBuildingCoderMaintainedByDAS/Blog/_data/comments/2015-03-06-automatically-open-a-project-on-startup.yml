  body: 'Thanks for this great new solution. I''ve been trying to get Process.Start();
    with a path to the .rvt file working for a few years now. It works great for 2013
    & 2015, but for some reason 2014 always gives me "can''t find network license"
    & starts up in demo mode. I get the same thing when I try to start Revit 2014
    with a .bat file. Oh well, prob. too late to fix it now, but this is a good workaround.


    thx,

    Barry'

  body: 'Dear Barry,


    Thank you for your appreciation!


    I am glad you find it useful.


    Sorry to hear about your issue with Revit 2014.


    Happily, I think it is just yours and can be fixed.


    I use Visual Studio to start Revit inside the debugger all the time, and that
    is basically the same thing as running it from the command line or a batch file.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: 'Hi Jeremy,


    Great this ability now exists. We have created a tool in-house that uses the Idling()
    event and Process() since Revit 2014, took a lot of work but seems to work fine.
    We launch Revit and open RVT files from our dialog. It is meant to ensure the
    users open files using best practices and avoid downtime and issues.
