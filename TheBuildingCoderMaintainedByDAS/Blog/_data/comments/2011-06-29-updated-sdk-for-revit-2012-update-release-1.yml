  body: "Hey, Jeremy:\n\nI compiled the SDKSamples2012 solution and changed the rvtsample.txt\
    \ as you instructed above. (No error, only one warning saying\n( \"Warning\t1\t\
    Function 'Execute' doesn't return a value on all code paths. Are you missing a\
    \ 'Return' statement?\tC:\\Program Files\\Revit 2012 SDK\\Samples\\TypeSelector\\\
    VB.NET\\Command.vb\")\n\nBut when I tried to debug it in Revit environment. \n\
    \nIt shows me this \n\"RvtSamples\nThe assembly does not exist.\nParameter name:\
    \ pushButtonData.AssemblyName\"\n\nI can see the RvtSamples tab and all the buttons\
    \ are gray that I cannot use them.\n\nPlease let me know what is going wrong.\
    \ Thanks very much."

  body: 'Dear Rui Liu,


    The warning you mention is expected, because the Visual Basic source code external
    command implementation really does lack the required return statement.


    The error reported by RvtSamples is due to some invalid path or command name in
    RvtSamples.txt.


    I added a link to a snapshot of my current version of RvtSamples.txt above for
    you, in case that is of any help.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'
