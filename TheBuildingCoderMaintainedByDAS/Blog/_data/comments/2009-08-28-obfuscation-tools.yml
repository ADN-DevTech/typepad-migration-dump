  body: "Hello Jeremy – full disclosure – I am a NON-technical employee at PreEmptive\
    \ Solutions (we make Dotfuscator). I read your blog entry with interest and it\
    \ raised a few questions for me and also prompted me to write this post. \n\n\
    Now, I realize that you are using (and are satisfied) with another tool – I am\
    \ not trying to fix something for you that is apparently not broken – but you\
    \ are obviously putting time into this area and I would hate to have you end up\
    \ with any misinformation about Dotfuscator.\n\nThe first comment that caught\
    \ my eye was that the Dotfuscator evaluation version was functionally incomplete\
    \ – in fact, other than requiring a network connection and the deactivation of\
    \ the command line interface (perhaps this is the feature that you wanted to test?)\
    \ – the evaluation version is fully functional. \n\nIs it possible that you were\
    \ using the Community Edition (CE) that is included with Visual Studio? CE is\
    \ the limited edition of Dotfuscator – but it is not an “evaluation” of the commercial\
    \ edition – it is simply a lite-weight obfuscator included with Visual Studio.\
    \ \n\nThe observation that you “have to exclude from obfuscation any methods that\
    \ external apps call into or access” is true for renaming but not control flow\
    \ (for example). But, more to the point, this renaming constraint would be true\
    \ for any implementation of renaming – were you under the impression that you\
    \ had to manually exclude these one at a time with Dotfuscator? (that would be\
    \ annoying!) \n\nThe commercial version of Dotfuscator (The Suite) includes a\
    \ “library mode” that leaves all entry points alone automatically. PLEASE NOTE\
    \ – if you have multiple assemblies that call one another (all yours) but do NOT\
    \ need to publish the calls to OUTSIDERS – Dotfuscator also supports cross-assembly\
    \ renaming – it will take in multiple assemblies and impose a consistent renaming\
    \ scheme across them all. This is true even if you add assemblies to the mix AFTER\
    \ the first obfuscation session at a later date (good for incremental updates,\
    \ patches, distributed development environments, etc.). \n\nI realize that you\
    \ gave up on Dotfuscator and so you may not have had the opportunity to evaluate\
    \ all of these functions, but for completeness – here are my comments on some\
    \ of the other capabilities you highlight: \n\nThe Dotfuscator Suite can:\n1.\t\
    Merge in dependent DLLs or embed them. \n2.\tPrune code that will never get executed.\
    \ \n3.\tAdd confusing metadata to the DLL so that .NET Reflector and MS IL Disassembler\
    \ cannot view it. \n\nCAUTION – there are easy ways to make this appear more effective\
    \ by adding INVALID metadata – HOWEVER, the resulting output application will\
    \ not peverify. If ensuring that your assembly is a verifiable .NET assembly –\
    \ then this can kill your application (even if all of your QA tests are positive).\
    \ Control flow obfuscation will also defeat Reflector, etc. – but does NOT output\
    \ invalid IL. \n\n4.\tSign your assembly with a strong name after obfuscation.\n\
    \nNow, as I “disclosed” upfront – I am not technical (I am in marketing), but\
    \ I would be more than happy to connect you to our live customer support. Again,\
    \ I am curious – did you evaluate the Community Edition and not The Suite? Did\
    \ you ever contact our support organization with these issues? \n\nIf you are\
    \ interested in following up with me offline (or get connected with more technical\
    \ resources), please do feel free to contact me directly at sebastian@preemptive.com.\
    \ \n\nThank you,\n\nSebastian."

  body: PS – the hazards of posting to a blog too quickly – as I re-read your last
    post, I see that the comments I responded to were from Greg Wesner and not from
    you directly – apologies - my offer of assistance of course stands – and if you
    could please pass my questions on to him, that would be terrific.  Thanks very
    much. Sebastian

  body: 'Dear Sebastian,


    Thank you for the clarification. Yes, I know the hazards of posting too fast all
    too well. I''ll point out your comments to Greg, and I am sure they are also of
    interest to anyone else following this thread.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: Just started looking at this. Using Dotfuscator CE v4.0.2008.10000...  Getting
    "Build Error" message with no input as to what is causing the error!  How can
    we use the product if there is no feedback on what is causing the error?  The
    project compiles perfectly through VS 2008.

    It is a lot cheaper but still has all of the features found in others, as well
    as some unique ones like Anti-Debug, Anti-Tamper, etc.
