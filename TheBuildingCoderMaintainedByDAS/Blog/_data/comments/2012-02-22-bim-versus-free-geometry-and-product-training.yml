  body: "Hi Jeremy,\n\nadditionally, think of all the problems that come with family\
    \ files.\n\nI had to do with different window families in which the INSTANCE_SILL_HEIGHT_PARAM\
    \ was defined in a different way, meaning that in some cases it was always zero\
    \ because the user made something wrong when creating the RFAs. \n\nOr think about\
    \ simple things like getting the window height or width.\nSometimes it is an Element\
    \ parameter, sometimes an ElementType parameter.\n\nEven it is an ElementType\
    \ width parameter, it could be possible that there is also a valid Element width\
    \ parameter, having a value of zero (but the parameter itself is not null).\n\n\
    Or remember the missing level param issue.\n\nProgramming for Revit means seaching\
    \ for workarounds.\n\n\nBye,\nRudolf\n\n\n-----"
