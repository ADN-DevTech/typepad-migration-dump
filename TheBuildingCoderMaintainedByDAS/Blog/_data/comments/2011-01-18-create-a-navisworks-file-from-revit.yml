    I just want to comment on your reply to the question; Question: I want to convert
    an RVT file into an NWD file with the help of the Revit API.


    Your response is the need for a licensed version of Navisworks if I''m not mistaken.  Otherwise
    the user will get an NWC file from the NWcreate app you described, not an NWD
    file as they asked.


    I for one have no need or demand for a licensed version of Navisworks, but it
    is nice for engineers, PM''s, and others to review my revit model in 3D.  For
    this purpose, they use Navisworks Freedom and we export our model to DWFx.


    My question now is (for our limited use), what is the purpose of Freedom if you
    still have to have a licensed Navisworks to create an NWD file, just use the licensed
    Navisworks?


    Is there not a better way to get an NWD file from our Revit models to use with
    Freedom than to buy yet another licensed software?'

    Freedom is a viewer. Creating an NWD file is a different matter than viewing it.
    In general, many more people have use of viewing functionality than creation functionality,
    don''t you agree?


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: 'Hi Jeremy,


    I read somewhere that the NWCreate library was built to work with standalone applications,
    and that linking to the library from a dll (a Revit plugin, for example) will
    not work because it''s not built against the appropriate runtimes. Are you able
    to confirm that is the case?'
