  body: 'Hi Jeremy. I´m using FindReferenceByDirection (revit 2011) to find the face
    of ceiling to place a ligthing fixture, but when I try to create the FamilyInstance
    gives an error "Planarface is null if you used GeometryObject make sure to use
    Computereferences", but the planarface isn´t null.


    My workaround is to get the ceiling from the reference and search each face again
    to get a valid Planarface.

    Can you give an advice about this?
