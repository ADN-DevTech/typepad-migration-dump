  body: 'Hi Jeremy,


    Nothing to see here but, I''ve got a question.

    I didn''t find it, maybe you can confirm it but, I can''t see the "Underlay" properties
    in a View object.'

    Do you mean the values specified in Manage > Settings > Halftone / Underlay command,
    which displays the Halftone/Underlay dialogue?


    I''ll check for you and let you know what I find out.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    No, I mean, when you select a FloorPlan, Click on Properties, Underlay and choose
    a FloorPlan level to Underlay it under my current view.

  body: "Dear Pierre,\n\nWell I'm glad I checked with you first then, and thank you\
    \ for the clarification. \n\nI selected Level 1 in the Floor Plans node in the\
    \ project browser, right clicked on it, and then selected Properties > Underlay.\
    \ In the drop-down list I specified Level 2, i.e. Level 1 will now display Level\
    \ 2 as an underlay.\n\nTo determine how to access this information through the\
    \ API I used RvtMgdDbg > Snoop Db... > ViewPlan > Level 1 > Parameters > Underlay,\
    \ et voila, the value of this parameter is Level 2, just like I set it through\
    \ the user interface.\n\nWhen I set the underlay back to none, the parameter value\
    \ changes to null.\n\nCheers, Jeremy."

    Very good...I''m going to have a look on it...Never look on the RvtMgdDbg. Keep

    No way to change this VIEW_UNDERLAY_ID parameter value by API!....

    Do you have an Idea?

  body: 'Dear Pierre,


    I proceeded as follows to verify that the VIEW_UNDERLAY_ID is writeable, not read-only:


    - Set Level 2 as an underlay for Level 1, so that it has a value.

    - Look at the parameters of Level 1 in RvtMgdDbg as described above.

    - Make a note of the Level 1 element id, which is 13073 in my case.

    - Select by id using Modify > Element ID >Select by ID and entering 13073.

    - Look at the Level 1 parameters in the ADN Revit Introduction Labs built-in parameters
    checker.


    It reports that the parameter is read-write:


    VIEW_UNDERLAY_ID  Underlay  ElementId  read-write  Levels ''Level 2''  15913


    You just have to set it to the element id of the level you want to use as an underlay.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: 5 months later, and your blog is still awesome.  As Revit becomes more popular
    the complication of programmers becomes greater.  Now I find myself automating
    the insertion of complex families that were created for a very specific task.

  body: 'Dear Sangsen,


    As always with family instances, it depends on the family definition, so there
    is no clear-cut answer.


    As far as I know, most vertical columns are designed using the column template.
    Have a look at that. It shows you that the top and bottom nodes are defined by
    the levels which the column attaches to. So if you want to use standard vertical
    columns, I think you need to set up the levels appropriately to define the start
    and end Z coordinates, and just have the XY coordinates defined by the insertion
    point.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'
