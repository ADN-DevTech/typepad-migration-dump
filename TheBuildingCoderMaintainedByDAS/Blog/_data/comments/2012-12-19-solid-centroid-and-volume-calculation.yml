    The CentroidVolume class is defined in the code above:


    <a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2012/12/solid-centroid-and-volume-calculation.html#4">http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2012/12/solid-centroid-and-volume-calculation.html#4</a>


    Simply add that definition to your macro module.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: 'Dear Joel,


    Thank you for the appreciation.


    I am very glad you find it useful.


    First, you never need to ask, because you can see it for yourself in the Visual
    Studio debugger.


    Secondly, it is actually documented above: "Here is the report logged to the debug
    output window...".


    That refers to the Visual Studio debug output console window.


    Cheers, Jeremy.
