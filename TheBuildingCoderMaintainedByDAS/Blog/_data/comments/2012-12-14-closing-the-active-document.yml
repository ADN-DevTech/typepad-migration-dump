  body: 'Hi Jeremy, I''ve try to solve this problem for one night long and failed.
    Can you help me?

    When I create a pipe in Revit, the new pipe''s parameter "PipingSystemType" has
    a default value. But when I create a pipe using Revit API as:

    Pipe pipe = doc.Create.NewPipe(xyz_1, xyz_2, pt);

    //pt is PipeType.

    The new pipe''s parameter "PipingSystemType" has no value, and I can''t set a
    value to it(whether in Revit or using API). I''ve try this:

    pipe.get_Parameter(BuiltInParameter.RBS_PIPING_SYSTEM_TYPE_PARAM).Set(id);

    //id is one of PipingSystemType''s Id.


    I hope to get your help, thank you!  celticblue'

    I created a new macro in Revit Architecture 2014. Once created, the compiler detect
    3 errors:

    Nope, sorry.


    But then I never use macros, personally.

    \nAnd it is the very last entry by Joao\nApril 23, 2014 at 12:38 pm - which reads:\n\
    \n\"I see that the problem is located to Document Macros. When I create an Application\
    \ Macro I don’t get the error.\"\n\nEven then I had to Google that statement!\
    \ \n\nWhen starting out with a macro within Revit the Macro Manager presents the\
    \ user with 2 tabs:\n\n'Application' - Use this option and none of the above build\
    \ problems occur.\n'(Revit project file name - which is the 'Document')' - This\
    \ gives rise to the build problems noted in the above train. Why SharpDevelop\
    \ cannot see the 3 files during the build process even though they are visible\
    \ in the 'Projects' folder etc defies logic.\n\nI hope this helps those who come\
    \ across the same hurdle, whilst starting their journey on the Revit API road,\
    \ as I am currently doing; \n\nKind regards\n\nPaul Matthews\n\nP.S. Thanks for\
    \ the blog Jeremy"
