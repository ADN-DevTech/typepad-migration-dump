  body: 'Hi Jeremy,


    Interesting post. I have a quick question about the IExternalApplication interface.
    I am tying an Idling event handler on the Startup event and was wondering what
    attributes, if any, do I have to specify for the class implementing IExternalApplication.
    My guess would be to not worry about transaction attribute, as I think its only
    relevant to External Commands, however do I have to specify Regeneration and Journaling
    attributes?


    Thanks

    I wonder why LT doesn''t even has a *subset* of the Revit API.

    If you remember Project Vasari, it was a free preview with limited API access.


    Thus, LT will not be accessible from outside at all...


    ;-(

  body: "Dear KR,\n\nThank you, glad you like it. \n\nRegarding the attributes required\
    \ for an external application: simple: none at all. \n\nHere is an old post describing\
    \ the situation for Revit 2012, in which the regeneration attribute was still\
    \ compulsory:\n\n<a href=\"http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2011/02/external-application-attributes.html\"\
    >http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2011/02/external-application-attributes.html</a>\n\
    \nNow it is not, and actually totally superfluous, neither of the two, regeneration\
    \ and transaction, are required for an external application. The journaling attribute\
    \ has always been completely voluntary anyway, so now an external application\
    \ requires no attributes at all.\n\nTry it out. \n\nCheers, Jeremy."

    no need to ask the product manager because I don''t believe that he takes my advice...


    At least, LT isn''t limited to 2D ;-)

  body: 'Dear Jeremy,


    Thanks for your response. I am still on 2012. The reason I asked the question
    was that my add-in loads and works fine without specifying the regeneration attribute
    and I just wanted to make sure I am doing it right. I am even calling regenerate
    method in the idling event. However, I have gone ahead and added it anyway.


    Cheers
