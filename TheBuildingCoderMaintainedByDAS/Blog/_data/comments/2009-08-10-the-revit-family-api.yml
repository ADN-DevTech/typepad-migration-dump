    Oh, great, if you can access these elements, the hard part is done. The access
    to geometry is always identical. You use the Geometry property on the Element
    class, provided in form of the get_Geometry method in C#:


    Autodesk.Revit.Element e;

    Autodesk.Revit.Geometry.Options opt = app.Create.NewGeometryOptions();

    Autodesk.Revit.Geometry.Element ge = e.get_Geometry( opt );


    There are lots of examples of accessing and analysing element geometry in the
    Geometry category of this blog, e.g. in the latest geometrical post

    Yes, I think your understanding is right. I have seen sample code for using IFamilyLoadOptions
    and heard from colleagues who have tried to use it, but as far as I know this
    event currently does not work as expected, so I am not surprised that you are
    not receiving any notification call-backs. The reason is that Revit 2010 simply
    refuses to reload the family, even if it has been edited. Sorry for the bad news.

    Yes, you can do that in the user interface, inside a family editor.  The label

    <a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2009/09/detail-lines.html">http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2009/09/detail-lines.html</a>


    Maybe the same is true for the annotation family. Once again, try it in the user
    interface first.

    I was able to complete my extesnion without having to use a Label.  But to answer
    your question, the dimension label is a bit different.  In the user interface,
    any label can be assigned to the dimension as long it has one parameter.  But,
    labels may have an infinite number of parameters.


    Programmatically, API is able to assign the parameter to the dimension directly
    as you saw in dim.Label = familyParam, but really no actual lable is created.


    What I was trying to do is to create a label that has n-number of parameters.
    I was going to associate the instances of that family with a Note Block.  What
    I found is that you can create the family, add the parameters to it and then load
    it into the project.  It will do the job without nothing physical is been created
    in the project.


    I hope this helps in explaining the difference.

    I am not quite sure about the whole workflow or the context of the operation you
    describe. If you say that saving and reloading the document helps, but you would
    like to avoid that, then I would suggest trying to encapsulate the operation in
    a transaction and committing it ... that might result in a similar update as the
    save and reload operation. Cf.

    I really have no idea. Have you tried it out? Does it behave well? Can you successfully

    by others trying this?

  body: "Thanks to geniuses like you. Software, technology, and engineering can progress!\
    \ Science is an art thanks to you Germans =D\n\nI am very fascinated with Revit\
    \ and I love using it for designing buildings simply because there is no other\
    \ practical way... You can turn a napkin 'elevation overlay' sketch into a virtual\
    \ building very quickly. I love it!!!\n\nRecently. One thought that came across.\
    \ Is it possible to create 'linked' network central database that organizes/contains\
    \ wall types, details, families, materials, regular/shared parameters, company\
    \ standards (annotation, view templates, those types of things....). This database\
    \ would be managed by few with admin access. However, there should be a temp dump\
    \ folder for new developing families/detail during earlier stages that can be\
    \ accessed and updated the same way, however, this will be less strict and accessible\
    \ to select people. \nOverall. It would be nice to have a database of components\
    \ that are created once, organized once, and updated once updating all the projects\
    \ that depend on this without having to do transfer project standard or copy/load\
    \ things manually. It is a HUGE hassle trying to organize certain things for multiple\
    \ projects. There always seems to be things I don't want in the Revit file. In\
    \ the end it creates a mess and it just bloats the file with junk and it slows\
    \ down the performance...\nThe interface handling would be the most interesting\
    \ workaround. How do you know what your database elements are versus everything\
    \ else... There should be four possible subcategories in order to know which:\n\
    \nDatabase elements (used for standards/production).\n\nDeveloping database elements\
    \ (in the works/early design/or user defined)\n\nUnreconciled elements (elements\
    \ that are copied from foreign projects that live in the actual file itself/not\
    \ organized correctly)\n\nThen system family/element (non editable elements that\
    \ are defaults by the software).\n\nNow in order to see what each element is.\
    \ There should be an automatic description labeled for each element, and an automatic\
    \ filtering hierarchy once the element exists in the database. For example element\
    \ would be something like '*6\"Stud-Plaster (Material/Color)_*DATABASE ELEMENT*'\
    \ This family would only exist inside the linked database, and once updated it\
    \ will automatically update all instances in all projects. In order to choose\
    \ and create from the drop down selection window. It will be in a category:\n\n\
    Basic Wall/*DATABASE ELEMENT*/(Wall Type)\n\nThis is just a thought. But, if anything\
    \ like this exists please let me know. If it does not exist I am sure you can\
    \ create in a day or two, I'll buy you a few beers =D.\n\nThanks,\n\nCorbin"

    Same answer as always (well, often): can you place the DWG manually, through the
    user interface?


    If so, it is probably possible programmatically as well. You can explore the manually
    generated model using RevitLookup and other tools to determine how and where the
    DWG was placed, and then reproduce that by coding.


    If not, then it is probably not possible through the API either.

    It is not possible outside of a Revit application thread. Even more, it requires

    Within the Revit API context, the question is answered by the standard getting
