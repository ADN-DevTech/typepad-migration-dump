  body: I followed the steps to find the NewGroup method listed in the API documentation.  However,
    the NewGroup method does not exist in the Autodesk.Revit.Creation Namespace or
    anywhere else that I can find.  (I am using the RevitStructure 2010 beta).  Have
    you found a NewGroup method elesewhere in the API?

  body: 'Hi John,


    I tried to NOT find NewGroup, but was unable to do so in the 2009 documentation  :-)


    In the Revit API help file RevitAPI.chm, I open the search tab and type NewGroup.


    It displays a couple of hits, three to be precise, and they all lead to the Document
    class in the Autodesk.Revit.Creation namespace and its NewGroup method.


    In the Revit 2010 version of the help file I get seven hits, three of which are
    the same as in the 2009 version. This is in Revit 2010 Beta 1. Please be aware
    that the 2010 material may be incomplete because it is still under development.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: 'Dear Rocky,


    Have a look at the discussion in


    <a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2009/06/model-group-shared-parameter.html">http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2009/06/model-group-shared-parameter.html</a>


    That shows how to determine the model group category. With the category and normal
    Revit 2010 filtering, retrieving the model groups is easy.


    And remember what I said in my answer to your last comment  :-)


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    Nope, I have never worked with attached detail groups, neither by chance nor otherwise.


    I don''t completely understand your problem, yet. Are you saying that you have
    implemented code to insert such a group successfully, and that it remains invisible
    but can be retrieved using the element collector?

    In looking through the documentation, I was not able to locate any method(s) that
    would allow me to programmatically bring in a RVT file as a group, analogous to
    the user-driven "Insert->Load as Group" command.  Am I missing something?


    thanks in advance, Chuck'

    The only access to any snap functionality in the Revit API that I am aware of
    is the Selection.PickPoint method taking an ObjectSnapTypes argument.


    I hope this helps.
