    Thanks very much for the training session; I got a lot out of it, and have some
    good ideas on how to proceed with building some useful API applications.


    I hope you enjoyed your very brief visit!'

  body: 'Hi Jeremy,


    On the topic of tags, I''ve come across what appears to be a nasty bug in both
    Revit 2013 and 2014, but not 2012. If you access an IndependentTag instance''s
    TagText property and the parameter that the tag is calling out is missing (i.e.
    where the tag display''s ''?'') then this causes Revit to crash with a crash dialog.
    Exception guards do nothing to prevent the crash.


    I wonder if others are able to replicate this bug?'

  body: 'Dear Dan,


    Thank you very much for reporting this!


    Sorry I took so long to respond, I have a large backlog of cases and comments
    and stuff.


    Could you please provide a reproducible case for this, and I will submit it as
    an issue to the development team?


    We will have to explore this in more depth to find out what is going on.


    For this purpose, could you please provide a minimal sample project and a reproducible
    test case, i.e.


    <ul>

    <li>A complete yet minimal Revit sample model to run a test in.</li>

    <li>A complete yet minimal Visual Studio solution with add-in manifest so that
    we can compile, load and run the application with a single click and explore its
    behaviour live in the sample model you provide.</li>

    <li>Detailed step-by-step instructions for reproducing the issue.</li>

    <li>Specification of the exact behaviour you observe versus what you expect.</li>

    </ul>



    When sending us sample material, please do not include any information that you
    consider to be confidential or a trade secret to your company. Thank you!


    Cheers, Jeremy.
