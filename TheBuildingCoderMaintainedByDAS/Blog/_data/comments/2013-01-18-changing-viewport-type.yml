    Use ElementType.Duplicate to create a ViewType if your ViewType is not already
    defined in the Revit Project.'

    Thank you for pointing out this obvious and important must-know method.


    I added a pointer to your note in the main post to ensure nobody misses it.

    Well, depends on the exact circumstances. There are several posts that describe
    how to set up a view and zoom to an object. Have you looked at Steve''s presentation
    mentioned above? Here are some other posts that may help:

    Probably I didn''t express myself properly and at your links I couldn''t find
    the answer.

    In these two images I just dragged the pink dot of the camera view from the site
    plan and it affects the distortion of the wall. Is it possible to set this distance/distortion
    (I  was calling it FOV) when I create the perspective  view?


    Thanks again,

    Matteo'

    Thank you for your appreciation, clarification and helpful sample images.


    I searched my archives and found an old comment by Jeff on the same topic:


    <a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2009/04/dwf-view-definition.html?cid=6a00e553e1689788330133ee54ea4c970b#comment-6a00e553e1689788330133ee54ea4c970b">http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2009/04/dwf-view-definition.html?cid=6a00e553e1689788330133ee54ea4c970b#comment-6a00e553e1689788330133ee54ea4c970b</a>


    At the time it was not possible, and we had an open wish list item #145414 [API
    request: The API to Get and Set the Zoom factor for view is needed] for that functionality.


    Looking into that record again, I see that the development team now state that
    this can be achieved using the UIView ZoomAndCenterRectangle and GetZoomExtents
    methods.


    I hope this solves your issue as well.


    Please do let me know how it goes, since I am sure this is of great interest to
    others also, and would love to publish a snippet of working sample code to set
    the desired FOV. Thank you!


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: 'Thanks again,


    I''m still working on this when I have time, and so far I found out that apparently
    the only parameter affecting the "distortion" of the view is the XYZ eyePosition
    parameter of the ViewOrientation3D. In fact by increasing it of 3.2 times (each
    of the XYZ coordinates) you get a FOV of around 60.


    Then of course Zoom can be adjusted via UIView ZoomAndCenterRectangle and GetZoomExtents
    methods.


    I''ll keep posting here as a have new findings and maybe a more "technical" approach
    ;)


    Cheers!'

    Actually, due to another question that just arose, I added your note about the
    extension line toggling parameter to a main blog post as well:


    <a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2013/02/parameters-versus-properties.html#2">http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2013/02/parameters-versus-properties.html#2</a>


    It also includes some observations on the interesting topic you bring up on properties
    versus parameters.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: 'Dear Michael,


    1. change the location of the View title?


    How would you achieve that through the user interface, please?


    2. The logic WhereElementIsElementType AND elem.Name == s AND !(elem is FamilySymbol)
    will return the first element encountered in the entire Revit database that has
    the name ''s'' and is not a family symbol.


    It is extremely improbable that such an element will happen to be a view type.


    Cheers, Jeremy.
