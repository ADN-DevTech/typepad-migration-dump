    I know this is a fairly old post, but the StringStringMap is behaving oddly in
    Revit 2011. (I dont know if it is the same in 2010)

    I want to add an extra entry to the end of the current list, (Key="CSC Library"),
    but it always ends up as the first item - i.e. changes the default which is absolutely
    not what we want to do.

    I have tried constructing a new StringStringMap object and experimented with Insert
    and set_Item and the order in which I add items, but I cannot get what I want.

    After adding random strings for the keys and paths, the only explanation I can
    come up with is that the Map is ordered by the Hash Code for each key!

    I also added the key manually in the actual Revit program and the returned StringStringMap
    is again ordered by Hash Code, not the order the user left it.

    Please can you confirm this behaviour and suggest a workaround - we think we must
    modify the revit.ini file before the program is started.'

    The age of the post is irrelevant, you can continue posting comments as long as
    you like and I will still see them.


    Since you are an ADN member, I would suggest that you to submit an ADN DevHelp
    request for this issue.


    In general, that is the safer way to go to obtain an answer, because my colleagues
    will see it as well as me, and also because that automatically hooks up to our
    knowledgebase.


    In this case it will make our exploration simpler, since we can refer to the ADN
    case when discussing it with the development team.


    Thank you!


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    I talked with the development team, and they are asking for some sample code to
    demonstrate the problematic behaviour. It would be helpful if you could provide
    that, and preferably submit a DevHelp Online case for it as well, to make it easier
    to keep track of.


    Thank you!


    Cheers, Jeremy.
