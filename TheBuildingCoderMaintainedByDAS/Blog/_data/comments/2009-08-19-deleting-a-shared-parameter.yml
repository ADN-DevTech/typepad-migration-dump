  body: 'Jeremy,


    I think the best way to handle the first situation (checking for an existing parameter)
    would be to store the original GUID for the parameter he creates on the first
    run, then check to see if a parameter with that GUID already exists on the second
    run.  I would guess that deleting parameters (and their data) would not be a good
    thing to do.


    This also brings up another issue.  In the AutoCAD world, the registered developer
    symbol program is used to prevent conflicts where two developers use the same
    names.  Ideally, his parameter would have some prefix (or some other system) to
    uniquely identify parameters that he has created.  How to handle this in Revit
    might be something to consider for future API releases.'

  body: "Dear Danny,\n\nThank you for the advice. I would also tend to agree that\
    \ deleting a parameter would generally not  be a good idea. I think in the case\
    \ that Joe is discussing here, the parameter has been added and removed for test\
    \ purposes only in a controlled situation, so there is no risk for unexpected\
    \ loss of valuable user data.\n\nKeeping track of the GUID is definitely the safest\
    \ way to go.\n\nYes, I am aware of the registered developer symbol convention\
    \ used in the AutoCAD application development context, and was actually quite\
    \ involved in its inception and early phases, initiated by the AutoCAD Developers\
    \ Group Europe, ADGE.\n\nI have explained its uses to the Revit development team\
    \ and asked what they think about implementing a similar system. They did not\
    \ express any great interest in officially endorsing this, for various reasons.\
    \ One reason is that for parameters visible to the user, such a prefix would be\
    \ unwieldy and confusing. Another is that the GUID already does provide a simple\
    \ method to uniquely identify parameters, regardless of the application creating\
    \ them. \n\nOn the other hand, there is nothing to stop developers from following\
    \ such a convention on their own accord, especially for parameters that are not\
    \ visible to the user. I most certainly would, if I were defining hidden parameters\
    \ for my Revit plug-in.\n\nCheers, Jeremy."

  body: 'I found myself in a situation where one of my teams Project file has 4 definitions
    of the same name (2 were string parameters and 2 were integer). So cleaning these
    out is the plan.

    Compare GUID''s is a great idea but how?  I can get the guid''s of the new and
    fresh parameters I wan''t to use from the shared parameters txt file, but how
    do I get the ID''s from the ones Revit is using in the open project.  The class
    Parameter.Definition does not expose an ID property. Did I miss something?'

    Have you had a look at the post on deleting a shared parameter?

  body: I did!  In fact I replied on that post.  There does not seem to be any way
    to ask revit the GUID of a shared parameter (that is loaded on an element, say
    a family instance of a beam).  Any Ideas?

    \ in these versions is an additional GUID property on the Parameter class which\

    Sorry, no suggestion off-hand... I would suggest you submit an ADN case.
