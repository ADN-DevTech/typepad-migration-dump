  body: 'Hello,


    There is a question related to the "Determine Cloud Model Local File Path" part.


    Starting from Revit 2024 user is able to change default location of Cloud model
    cache in File -> Options -> Cloud Model menu.


    Is there a way how to get overridden Cloud model cache location using Revit API
    instead of using hardcoded value?


    Thank you.'
