  body: Where can I find a list of all Revit commands for the SDK? Are there commands
    for drawing profiles for family creation? Also commands to insert parameters?
    Copy, Rename, and change parameters. The idea here, is to create family objects
    defined by a externally generated program, and then create families and place
    within a Revit project. thanks

  body: 'Hi Ron,


    The entire Revit API is described in the Revit API help file. There is currently
    no API at all for family creation. You can create new shared parameters through
    the API; this is demonstrated by the FireRating SDK sample. You cannot rename
    parameters through the API.


    Best regards,


    Jeremy'
