    Sorry, no idea. Is that an API question, or more a product and user interface
    issue? Sounds rather like the latter to me.

  body: 'Hi Jeremy,


    I noticed in the UI you can connect a pipe to a family instance (say a water heater)
    that has a cold water connector by setting one end of the pipe on that connector,
    and Revit automatically builds several intermediate connecting pipes.


    I''m wondering if the API provides this functionality somewhere - if I have a
    pipe already near such a fixture, is there a way to tell the API to build whatever
    intermediate pipes are necessary to connect my existing pipe to that fixture?

  body: "Dear Dave,\n\nGood question. No, the API does not quite provide all of that\
    \ functionality, but some of it. What you can do is place some of the pipes yourself,\
    \ and then call NewElbowFitting to place elbows or whatever you need in the appropriate\
    \ locations to connect them together. The part that the Revit API will perform\
    \ automatically for you is to lengthen or shorten the pipes appropriately to connect\
    \ them to the neighbouring fittings. \n\nExamples demonstrating this are provided\
    \ by the Revit SDK samples AutoRoute and AvoidObstruction. \n\nA more complex\
    \ example is the placement of cable trays and fittings, discussed in\n\n<a href=\"\
    http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2010/05/cable-tray-orientation-and-fittings.html\"\
    >http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2010/05/cable-tray-orientation-and-fittings.html</a>\n\
    \nThis case is more complicated, since the cable trays are not symmetric around\
    \ their central axis, unlike pipes, and therefore need to be correctly oriented\
    \ to hook up properly.\n\nCheers, Jeremy."

    I had used NewElbowFitting before, but it was not obvious to me from the documentation
    that it could potentially move or otherwise modify the connecting elements.


    Anyway, thanks for the help.'

  body: "Greeting to the Revit API magician, Jeremy!\n\nWe have a certain dilemma\
    \ for which we are searching some reasonable solution. Maybe you got some idea.\n\
    \nAs you stated, MEP devices may have many different connections (for power, pipes\
    \ for cooling water in- and outlets etc.). But furthermore there can be also several\
    \ pipe connection pairs (heating & cooling).\n\nWhat I'm asking is that how we\
    \ should separate these connection pairs within a device. \n\nLet say we want\
    \ to do some operations for certain networks and user have to select one from\
    \ the project. Everything is simple when there's only devices with two pipe connections\
    \ (normal radiators)...user just clicks a pipe and a whole network is fetched\
    \ automatically. But if same is done with network containing pipe devices more\
    \ than two pipe connections...how to know where does network continue.\n\nWe have\
    \ tried to write some additinal information to connector parameters in the family\
    \ but now we realized that we can't acces them from the project. And if we open\
    \ the family document for fetching this data, how do we know which connector refers\
    \ to connector we want.\n\nIs there any way to do this kind of mapping? Would\
    \ we benefit something from the connector linking in this case?"

    Lots of unclear issues in that question, I''m afraid, in spite of its length and
    clarity.


    I don''t know how much of what you are asking is about the user interface and
    how much about the API.


    I don''t see why you cannot access certain parameters "from the project". I am
    not aware of any such limitation.


    What kind of mapping? What connector linking?


    I would suggest that you submit an ADN case.


    Thank you!

    1. Yes, of course it is possible to support Architecture, MEP and Structure with
    one single identical add-in. Please read the Getting started material, which describes
    that.


    2. Connectors are virtual objects which have no geometry and therefore no solid.

    I am sorry to say that I know neither the details of IFC nor the Revit MEP product

    I would hope that an application engineer, product usage expert, or product support
    can answer this better than I can.


    Or you can simply try it out and let us know what you discover.
