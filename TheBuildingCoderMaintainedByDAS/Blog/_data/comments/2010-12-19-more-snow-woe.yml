    \ VS 2101 Express (thanks to your valuable posts), and started working on ACA.NET\
    \ after watching your 2 last web-casts. I am facing a problem with the Graph class\
    \ when running AecWallSystemSampleMgd (see code below)\n\n   Manager mgr = new\
    \ Manager(db);\n   Graph theGraph = mgr.FindGraph(wall); \n\nI am always getting\
    \ null value for theGraph object, when I debug the mgr.GraphCount is always 0.\n\
    \nAny help in this regard will be highly appreciated and also if you have any\
    \ resource regarding ICF wall system in ACA would be very helpful"

  body: 'Dear Ray,


    Congratulations on getting it up and running in VS Express and thank you for the
    appreciation. I am glad that the posts were useful.


    I am sorry to say that I currently don''t do that much with ACA, and I have no
    idea why your call might be returning null.


    I suggest that you log a query with ADN DevHelp Online, if you are a member, and
    otherwise try your luck on the other Autodesk and AUGI forums:
