  body: 'Dear Wesley,


    I am pretty hopeful that you do not really mean what you say.


    ''All objects'' is a heck of a lot of stuff in Revit.


    In fact, the filtered element collector class is expressly designed to prevent
    an add-in from selecting all objects:

    Assuming you wish to select all elements that are not types, that is easily achieved:
    just use the filtered element collector WhereElementIsNotElementType shortcut.


    Basically, it sounds as if you will be best helped by taking a good look at the
    getting started material:


    <a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/about-the-author.html#2">http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/about-the-author.html#2</a>


    It covers basic issues such as programmatically selecting elements and modifying
    their parameter values.


    Cheers, Jeremy.
