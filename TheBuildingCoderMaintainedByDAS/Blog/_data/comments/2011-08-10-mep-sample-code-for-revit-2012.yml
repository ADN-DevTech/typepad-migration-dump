  body: 'Hello Jeremy, I have been following up your discussions for sometime now
    and i find them really interesting. I am trying to link revit elements (e.g. walls,
    doors etc) to an MS database. Such that if i write "installed" in the property
    column of a door (in a database), i can read "installed" in the door property
    in revit and the color of the door changes.

    I want to set this in a loop to keep running. How do i achieve this?'

    Thank you for your appreciation, glad you find this interesting.


    You can save the element id or its unique id plus any additional data you are
    interested in to the external database.


    Then you can subscribe to the Idling event and implement an event handler for
    it. Whenever it is triggered, the handler can check whether the database entry
    was updated and modify the Revit model.


    This is discussed in various blog posts on this event, e.g.

    Cheers, Jeremy.
