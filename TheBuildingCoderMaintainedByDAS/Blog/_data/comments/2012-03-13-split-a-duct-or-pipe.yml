  body: The most common use for duct piping in residential construction is to shorten
    the amount of flex duct required to connect the duct truck line to the register.
    Flex duct has a higher rate of friction loss than smooth duct pipe and, therefore,
    adding round pipe to your duct system increases the efficiency of your system.

  body: 'Dear Bang,


    You can modify the existing line''s curve''s endpoint to shorten it as desired.


    You will have to create a new second model line to replace the missing part, though.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: I created a flex duct with the API through the Document.Create.NewFlexDuct(Connector1,
    Connector2, FlexDuctType) method.  But now I want to change the flex duct size
    to match the connector size at my diffuser.  This should be simple enough, but
    MEPCurve.Diameter is read only, I can't edit it.  Is it possible to change flex
    duct size through the API?

  body: 'Dear Ryan,


    I would say yes.


    Indeed, the MEPCurve.Diameter is read only, because it is driven by the entire
    duct system.


    You can change the dimensions by editing the connectors, I believe, or by adding
    a fitting somewhere in between.


    Look at the Connector Height, Width and Radius properties, for example. They are
    all read-write.


    I would also expect the duct size to update automatically as soon as you connect
    it to the diffuser.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: Jeremy, thanks for the help.  We were able to get it to work finally.  We
    created an MEPCurve from the flex duct, a connector set from the MEPCurve, then
    changed connector radii of the connector set to equal the diffuser connector size.  Now
    we can draw flex duct in a section view.
