  body: 'Hi Jeremy,


    I noticed this in the SDK documentation about the addmapfield function: "Natural
    comparison of contained types is used for sorting." Is there a way to store a
    map field without the keys being sorted?'

  body: "Dear Paul,\n\nOf course it is not possible to affect the way the fields are\
    \ stored internally. There is some kind of dictionary being used internally, and\
    \ it has to use some kind of key comparison mechanism. \n\nAnyway, I do not see\
    \ how that could be of any earthly interest to you. Nobody is going to see the\
    \ contents of this container except through your own programmatic interface.\n\
    \nWhy are you asking this? What are you trying to achieve?\n\nCheers, Jeremy."

  body: I'm creating a macro to work on door hardware and the order of the door hardware
    list is specified by the user to match the door schedule. I'll just have to create
    a list that stores the order the hardware should be in.

    Oh, I see. Yes, I guess you will have to store the order yourself somehow.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: Hi Jerermy, Can you add new fields once a schema has been create? I am trying
    to add a new field but get "A different schema with the same identity already
    exists" Is the only way to add new fields to delete the existing schema and create
    a new one?

  body: "Dear Christopher,\n\nSorry, the answer is no. And the other answer is yes.\n\
    \nYou need to create an entirely new schema. That is the only safe way to implement\
    \ such a system.\n\nIn your add-in, you can simply support both schemata, and\
    \ implement functionality to upgrade from one to the other, either automatically\
    \ or on demand, and even to downgrade if you so wish.\n\nThis is demonstrated\
    \ by one of the samples in my Autodesk University 2011 class CP4451 - Extensible\
    \ Storage in the Revit 2012 API: \n\nUpgradeSchema - Handle versioning issues\
    \ when upgrading and extending an existing extensible storage schema.\n\nCheers,\
    \ Jeremy."

  body: 'I thought that might be the answer. Could become a problem with version control,
    each time you think of something else that could be stored in there, either control
    the versions or multiple schemas, which would be the best solution? Would have
    been nice and simple if I could just modify the schema.

    Cheers Chris'

    I do not see the problem at all, whereas I definitely do see a whole bunch of
    possible problems if you try to solve it in any other manner.

    I would not wait if I were you.


    You can easily store a list of strings by simply concatenating them, using any
    delimiter you like that does not occur in any of the strings. If absolutely all
    characters may occur in the strings, you can use it anyway and escape the original
    occurrences.


    Cheers, Jeremy.
