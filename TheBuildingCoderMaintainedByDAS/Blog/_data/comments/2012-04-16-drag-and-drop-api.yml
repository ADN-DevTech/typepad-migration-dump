  body: "Hi Jeremy,\n\nI have created DocPanel in WPF and I am trying to use UIApplication.DODragDrop(filePath,handler);\
    \ \nBut this method does not work with WPF. \nIf I used same approach with Windows\
    \ forms it works fine.\n\nCould you please suggest me how to make this method\
    \ work with WPF.\n\nThanks,\nAtul\n-----"
