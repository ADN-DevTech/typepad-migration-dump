  body: A lilttle bit late to the party, but why? This still happens in Revit 2025-2026.
    Wouldn't it be much simpler to store them internally in Volts?

  body: 'Yes, that might be. Apparently, the development team preferrs to stick with
    the fundamental SI units. You can raise a wish list item in the Revit Idea Station,
    or simply apply the appropriate conversion factor. These units are internal database
    numbers. No need to show them to any end user. Cheers, Jeremy.
