    \ a command running within another document using code like the following:\n\n\

    \    Autodesk.Revit.Creation.Application creApp = app.Create;\n\n    // draw some\

    Glad you liked it! Unfortunately, as said, there is basically no support for drawing
    anything at all through the API in the family editor. Regarding extrusions, the
    situation is even more limited ... the Extrusion class is read-only, so to speak.
    It is derived from GenericForm, which can be *queried* for a generic form for
    use in family modelling and massing. The Revit API currently provides no methods
    at all for creating these kinds of shapes. So I am completely unable to help you
    any further in this. Sorry about that. Good luck finding an alternative solution!

    I am glad the creation of sheets for drafting views works for you. I understand
    that you have a problem when you try to create multiple sheets displaying the

    the context menu. You are now asking how to duplicate the view through the API
    to avoid the manual step. Is that correct?


    I do not know offhand whether it is possible to duplicate a view through the API.
    How have these views been generated? If they were generated through the API as
    well, it might be simpler to generate all the required copies of them right from
    the beginning to avoid the need to duplicate them later.

    One option that comes to mind, however, is that you can easily implement your
    own screen snapshot utility as part of your Revit plug-in. I googled for the search
    keys ".net screen snapshot", and the following first two hits which appeared both

    Looking through previous comments and posts for purge, I discovered that I have

    using AutoHotkey for Revit 2009. That is mentioned in

    I think your approach sounds fine. Store the creation data externally, start Revit,
    fetch the data, load the required families and create the framing. It would be
    easier to implement this as an external command, though, rather than using the
    document open event. In any case, I wish you good luck with your project!

    I need a tool capable of drawing, by programming, parametric models of buildings.
    By parametric I mean drawing objects (e.g beams) which parameters (e.g. dimensions)
    are not fixed but depend on another parameters, of the same object or of other
    objects. Hence, changing one parameter of one object affects other parameters,
    of the same object or of other objects.


    Can I do this with Revit? If yes, is using VSTA the easier way?


    Thank you.
