    Thank you very much for finding and sharing that link, but unfortunately it doesn''t
    seem to work.  I''ve tried a couple of times on a couple different web browsers
    and it just times-out.


    It also appears that Autodesk has very recently significantly redesigned their
    web site, so finding things where they used to be doesn''t seem to be an option
    any more.


    While the relesed versions of Revit Architecture 2013 and Revit Structure 2013
    do appear to be available on ADN, since the released version of Revit MEP 2013
    is still not available, even on ADN, I''m not sure what to think (other than that
    Marketing has been very busy ;-)

    I have not tried getting it from the Beta site because I wasn''t sure it was really,
    truly "the same" as the released version.


    Basically I do not want to install anything "beta-like" on my main development
    machine.  I always install "beta-like" things on a virtual machine, and then just
    discard the VM when done.


    What I was looking for was something to install on my main development machine,
    so I wouldn''t have to keep starting up and shutting down VMs all the time.


    Interestingly, Autodesk sent the Big Release news out via e-mail and told me I
    could get my 2013 version of MEP suite at a link that goes to the subscription
    center.


    I went to that link and logged in to access my subscription content, and sadly
    2012 is the latest version shown.  I''m not sure why Autodesk would send out an
    e-mail saying "get your 2013 software from this link" when it wasn''t actually
    there. (???)


    That may be another point of interest to mention to the team.


    Thanks again very much for the valuable information, as always.'

    I have a question about the .NET version for the Revit 2013 API.

    According to the document ''changes and additions'' in API, add-in projects must
    be compiled with the .NET 4.0 compiler.

    But my old project compiled with .NET 3.5 seems to be successfully loaded on Revit
    2013. (I used the trial version of Revit 2013)

    In fact, Revit 2011 and 2012 are also installed in my system.

    Is it the case caused by multi-setting of 2 or more versions ?

    Or, Am I missing something ?


    Thank you in advance.'

  body: 'Dear Mona,


    Thank you for a very pertinent question which I had to explore the answer for
    myself first.


    The exposure in Revit 2013 is via the new Ceiling class. Look at the Revit API
    help file RevitAPI.chm for its description and members.


    The What''s New section of the help file states:


    Ceiling, Floor and CeilingAndFloor


    The newly exposed Ceiling class represents a ceiling in Revit. It inherits from
    CeilingAndFloor. The Floor class has been modified to also inherit from CeilingAndFloor.


    The introduction of the Ceiling class thus at least lets developers filter by
    the Ceiling class and access its data.


    There is indeed no ceiling creation API, though.


    The creation Document.NewFloor method also looks unchanged to me.


    You may be able to create a new ceiling by copying an existing one somehow, or
    more tricky still, creating a group from an existing one, copying the group, and
    ungrouping again afterwards. That trick has been used in the past for certain
    other elements lacking an official creation API. If it works, it would do so in
    both Revit 2012 and 2013.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    Will this be tackled in API 2013?

    About the PhaseFilter, I''m working on a 5D feature based on phase property of
    Revit models. I assume PhaseFilter is used for filtering models assigned specified
    CreatedPhasedId and DemolishedPhaseId. But I don''t know how to use PhaseFilter
    to achieve it. The backup approach is to iterate all elements and compare their
    CreatedPhasedId and DemolishedPhaseId to expected value. But as you mentioned
    in other cases, that''s not an efficient way.

    Has there been an update in accessing the sketch lines? If not, could you provide
    reference to an unsupported method?
