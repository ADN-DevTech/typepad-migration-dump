    Is there any way that you could write a macro that would allow users to record
    a macro?  I''m completely serious - we as mere mortal users have to work within
    temporal and financial constraints, so we don''t have time to learn how to write
    macros in C# or .net, but we DO need to be able to automate repetitive tasks in
    Revit.


    Any hope?


    Thanks'

    Hope there is, of course, always. This is a very interesting idea and something
    that has been talked about in the past as well. It will probably have to picked
    up by the Revit development team itself, long-term. I would recommend not to hold
    your breath while you wait.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    Last year I asked this question here, as well as on the Autodesk Discussion Groups,
    and now someone may have an answer - use the journal files:


    <a href="http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/Autodesk-Revit-API/Macro-to-record-a-macro/td-p/2982890">http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/Autodesk-Revit-API/Macro-to-record-a-macro/td-p/2982890</a>


    Is this a possible solution (ordinary users creating macros), or is this just
    urban legend, as suggested?


    Thanks so much for all of your contributions.
