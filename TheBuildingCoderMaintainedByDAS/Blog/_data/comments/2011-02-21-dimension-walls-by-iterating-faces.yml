    The code above worked for me all right. I don''t know why you are having problems.
    Bad karma?

  body: 'Hi Jeremy,

    I am working on exporting Walls to our cadd application and I am finding Wall.Solid
    with only one face. This makes no sense to me. There are 9 out of 160 walls with
    this situation. Have you seen this before? Is there a logical explaination for
    only one surface on a solid?'

  body: 'Dear Ron,


    Yes, I have heard of this in the past, and no, there is not really a logical explanation
    for this, since a solid with just one face cannot really be a ''real'' solid.
    It may depend on the view and other things. I think you will just have to live
    with this for the moment.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: 'Hi Jeremy , can we have a code that allow us to select multiple wall and
    make dimension between them for wall faces once for all.

    Multiple walls per one process is really powerful

    only two wall is not that powerful of API supposed to do

    Are you agree with me ?

    So can we add a procedure like select multiple walls

    please help ,

    waiting for your answer'

    Sure you can do this. Simply select the walls one by one and put them into a collection
    that you handle programmatically.

    As you probably are perfectly capable of discovering for yourself, I regularly
    update The Building Coder samples.


    The version you refer to is 2011.0.85.0, for Revit 2011.


    The one I published last is 2014.0.100.4, for Revit 2014:


    <a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2013/06/processor-architecture-mismatch-warning.html">http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2013/06/processor-architecture-mismatch-warning.html</a>


    That is the third one for Revit 2014.


    I published 16 intermediate versions for Revit 2012, and 10 for 2013.


    There may be a significant number of sample commands that do not work in the newer
    versions, since I do not test them, just ensure that the code compiles.


    If you find anything to fix, please do so, let us know what you did, how, and
    why. Thank you.


    Good luck exploring!


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: 'Hello Jeremy,


    I am very sure that you are updating the examples whenever there''s a new version
    of Revit comes up.


    But due to the nature of your prolific blog, I am having a hard time finding the
    right version. While I found 2014 version of the file, sadly, our office is still
    in 2013 that''s why I need to refer back to 2013 of your examples.


    How I wish there''s a link somewhere in the navigation where we can find repositories
    of all the version examples.


    Otherwise, I will have to scan all your blog archives just to find version 2013
    of your very precious examples.


    Best, Rey'

    Just like programming, effective Internet searching is an art in itself.


    How about this:


    lmgtfy.com/?q=revit+building+coder+sample+2013+2014+migration


    The first 2014 version also includes a link back to the last 2013 one.

    Yes! I have already asked our good old friend Google immediately after I sent
    my comments and it gave me the result that I want.


    Quick question though, in the CmdDimensionWallsIterateFaces.cs, the example is
    using two parralel walls, yeah? but it is also possible to select multiple parallel
    walls, yeah?


    again, thanks for all your help.

    Yes, of course. It would need to be modified to handle that case, though, of course.

  body: 'Dear Jeremy,

    I am trying to dimension walls by their common edges (their vertical intersections),
    not by faces. As some projects (like stadiums) haven´t  parallel walls.

    But I am having many difficulties getting a stable reference from their face intersections.

    I have a stable reference to each face endpoints, but it leaves out intersections.

    I have tried with Face.Intersect() but the resulting curves have their reference
    set to null.

    Do you have any suggestions?


    Cheers, José'

  body: 'Dear José,


    My first suggestion is always the same: how would you best achieve this through
    the user interface?


    If it is not possible, it may be hard through the API as well.


    If you really want to force this behaviour, here is a hard-core suggestion that
    I think should work:


    1. Implement an add-in that calculates the intersection points that you want to
    dimension from and to.


    2. Place family instance in those two locations. If you want them to keep and
    update their locations under all circumstances, e.g. when things move around,
    you might want to use the dynamic model updater framework DMU.


    3. Dimension between the family instance insertion points as recently described:


    <a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2014/11/picking-pairs-and-dimensioning-family-instance-origin.html#3">http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2014/11/picking-pairs-and-dimensioning-family-instance-origin.html#3</a>


    Sorry for this extremely brute force approach.


    I very much hope that there are better and leaner solutions available.


    My intention here is to shock rather than instruct  :-)


    Cheers, Jeremy.'
