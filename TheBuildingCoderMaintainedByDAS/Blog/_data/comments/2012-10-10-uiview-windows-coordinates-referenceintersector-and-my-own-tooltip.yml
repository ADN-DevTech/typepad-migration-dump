  body: 'Wow.  This is so cool.  Now I need to implement this into my Project Browser
    to get the curser position for dragging/dropping views to sheets.  At the moment
    the views are being placed at a predefined x,y co-ord, but it looks as though
    I may be able to get the mouse co-ord now in relation to the revit view?  SOmething
    to play with.


    BTW Jermey I own a farm with rather large mountain and a few thousand sheep if
    you ever want to come to New Zealand treking ;)'

  body: Our mountain rises to 1700m ASL.  our house is at 400m, so not huge but not
    insignificant.
