  body: 'How does Revit determine if a family is changed or not? Because we are observing
    the strange behaviour that the Document.LoadFamilySymbol() will work fine when
    an instance of a family type of this family is present in the drawing, but will
    silently fail when no such reference exists.

    I.e. if we delete the references to a Family prior to recreating and reloading
    it the call will fail, but if we leave at least one reference then the call will
    succeed and the existing instance will be updated.'

  body: 'Dear Mark,


    I asked my colleagues but received no satisfactory answer as of yet.


    You are an ADN member, aren''t you? Please submit a DevHelp Online case with a
    reproducible case and a clear description of what you are trying to achieve and
    in what way it is going wrong to motivate some further exploration of this.


    Thank you!


    Cheers, Jeremy.
