    instead of casting (e as Room) and then checking whether the casting result is
    not null, you better could check if (e is Room) *before* the casting and then
    only cast Elements that *are* Rooms.

  body: 'Dear Rudolf,


    Thank you for the suggestion, yet I beg to disagree.


    As far as I know, the check whether ''e is Room'' costs as much as the cast to
    ''e as Room'', and it is therefore more efficient to cast right away and avoid
    the check completely, or at last replace it by the less costly comparison with
    null.


    Check it out, I have seen this mentioned elsewhere as well, e.g. among the five
    wonders:

  body: "Hi, Jeremy.\nA little addition.\nInstead Rudolf suggestion to use (e is Room)\
    \ the better way is to use LINQ:\nFilteredElementCollector collector = \n    new\
    \ FilteredElementCollector(doc);\nvar rooms =\n    collector\n        .OfClass(typeof(SpatialElement))\n\
    \        .OfType<Room>()\n        .ToList();\n\nFurthermore, you can forgot about\
    \ SpatialElement to filter rooms and use native RoomFilter :)\n\nBut I don't understand\
    \ why it is not possible to use collector.OfClass(typeof(Room)). The base class\
    \ of Room class is SpatialElement class. The base class of SpatialElementClass\
    \ is Element class. So the Room class is Element class.\n\nHope information was\
    \ useful.\n\nHave a nice day,\nVictor.\n\nupd. angle brackets has disappeared\

    Thank you for the improvement.


    I updated The Building Coder sample code accordingly and bumped the version number
    to 2013.0.100.2.

    Greetings !!!



    I have to find total number of lighting fixtures in a rvt file / in every room.

    It should give me power in ''watts'' (for the complete room), Lumen, Efficacy
    etc.


    How to achieve it ?


    I''m scratching my head from last 3 days in this.


    Need your help now.


    Thanks,

    Vipul'

    Greetings to you too.


    This sounds like a relatively simple affair to me.


    Combine a filtered element collector and an accumulator.


    Scratching your head for days on end is unfortunately not going to help.


    The way forward is research, implementation, testing etc.


    All the information you need is available right here.


    Have fun exploring, and let us know what you come up with.


    Thank you!


    Cheers, Jeremy.
