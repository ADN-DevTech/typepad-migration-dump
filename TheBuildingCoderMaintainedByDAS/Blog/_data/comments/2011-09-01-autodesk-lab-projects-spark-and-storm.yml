    Should be no problem at all, and it has nothing to do with the Revit API. Use
    the methods from the .NET Windows.Forms library.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    I would strongly suggest that you simply search the Internet for exactly what
    you want. There are sooo many examples available, and it really depends completely
    on what you need.


    Cheers, Jeremy.
