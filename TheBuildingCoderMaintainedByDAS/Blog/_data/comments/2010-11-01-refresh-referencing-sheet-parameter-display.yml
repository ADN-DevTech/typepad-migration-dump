    \ the call to the Document.AutoJoinElements method. \n\nThe only suggestion I\
    \ can make is to ensure that the elements are getting joined properly and as expected\
    \ when you create the same situation manually. If not, find out how you can rectify\
    \ that in the manual situation. Then it should work for the programmatically driven\
    \ case as well.\n\nCheers, Jeremy."

  body: 'Hi，I am from China. I have a project on Industrial Building Design （with
    Revit API development）. My question is how I can let a sweep object in a family
    with a profile parameter, through which I can change it''s value in another host
    family file or project. By API? I know it cannot be done in Revit straightforward.


    Thanks

    I am not a Revit user, so I cannot say anything about the user interface for this.
    I would have thought it is pretty straightforward, though. Please look at the
    family API labs:
