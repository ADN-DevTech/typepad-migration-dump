    I am totally hijacking this thread, so let me apologize first, but I had send
    you a tweet (but then I noticed you havn''t used your twitter for about a year
    :-).


    I am facing this problem, and I think it''s right up your alley:

    I couldn''t find a solution on your excellent blog (I have never seen such a complete,
    usefull blog!), so that''s why I am asking here.


    Feel free to remove this reply if you deem it unfit.'

  body: 'Dear Teun Ham,


    Thank you for the appreciation.


    Your question is perfectly appropriate and you have nothing to apologise for.


    I looked at your stackoverflow thread and do not really see anything to add.


    In fact, I think the questions and answers in that thread are useful and relevant
    enough to warrant a blog post of their own.


    Yes, you can only change the family instance dimension parameter values after
    the instance has been placed.


    Yes, you could define different types for different values, and then place the
    type.


    You could create those types on the fly immediately before placing the instance.


    In Revit 2015, you can define which family type is placed by PromptForFamilyInstancePlacement.


    Where do the width and height etc. come from?


    Can you determine them immediately before the call to PromptForFamilyInstancePlacement?


    If so, then you could create a new family type with those dimensions on the fly
    and set that to be the active type right before the call to PromptForFamilyInstancePlacement.


    Cheers, Jeremy.
