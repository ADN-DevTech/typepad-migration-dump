    Is it possible in Revit to extend the curtain wall patterns or maybe introduce

    If it is possible in the user interface, then the Revit API may support it as
    well.


    So please explore the UI aspect first, asking an application engineer, product
    usage expert, or product support.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: 'Dear Jeremy,


    Thank you for your prompt reply.


    I am an advance user of Revit Architecture and I find the surface pattern under
    the conceptual massing limited to only whats in the default pattern properties.


    I''ve always wanted to introduce my own pattern ( and I guess this is the dream
    of all Architects/Designers), so I would like to know if there is a way I can
    do that using the API.


    And while I can say I am proficient in Revit, I am a beginner C# developer, so
    if you could point me to the right resources, I would greatly appreciate it as
    I am willing to explore all the possibilities just so I can extend the surface
    pattern in the conceptual massing model.


    regards, Rey'

    Thank you for your appreciation  and background info.


    Is it possible to extend the curtain wall patterns or maybe introduce new patterns
    via the API?


    Like with all good questions, the answer is yes and no.


    Via the API, you cannot create curtain panel patterns outside of what exist in
    the UI.


    However, there are at least three options for users who want to extent the curtain
    panel by pattern functionality:


    1. Rethink how you are using the existing patterns.  Look at these posts for what
    I mean:


    <a href="http://buildz.blogspot.com/2009/08/making-custom-patterns.html">http://buildz.blogspot.com/2009/08/making-custom-patterns.html</a>


    <a href="http://buildz.blogspot.com/2010/06/beehives-are-back-real-equilateral.html">http://buildz.blogspot.com/2010/06/beehives-are-back-real-equilateral.html</a>


    2. Use the Repeat/Divide functionality to create new patterns:


    <a href="http://buildz.blogspot.com/2012/12/pattern-deformation.html">http://buildz.blogspot.com/2012/12/pattern-deformation.html</a>


    <a href="http://buildz.blogspot.com/2013/01/origami-and-context-aware-panel-being.html">http://buildz.blogspot.com/2013/01/origami-and-context-aware-panel-being.html</a>


    3. Make patterns entirely through the API:


    Curtain panels can be placed directly through the API, and application creators
    can define their own patterns to connect the dots. Nathan Miller has some examples
    of this here:


    <a href="http://wiki.theprovingground.org/revit-api-py-adaptive">http://wiki.theprovingground.org/revit-api-py-adaptive</a>


    I hope that helps. Good luck!


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    Thank you for these gem resources! these should keep me occupied for awhile ;-)


    But hopefully in the future, Revit will have some functionality that user can
    load acad patterns or something like that and revit will recognize it as a valid
    pattern.


    more power Jeremy!

    I googled for "revit load autocad pattern" and found a lot of existing solutions
    that you may want to take a look at:

    All the beginners material is available publicly. Some advantages of an ADN membership
    are: access to almost all released Autoesk software, pre-release software, confidential
    information, conferences, training and preferred support treatment.
