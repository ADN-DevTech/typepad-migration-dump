    The problem I''m having lead me to this page, it is not with your code however
    I believe you may be able to help. I have rotated some text objects with the API
    and the TextNote bounding box appears as a parallelogram and not a rectangle until
    i attempt to rotate it. Do you have any idea what I could be doing wrong?


    I love the blog and I attended a class of yours at AU2010! Thanks in advance,'

    I took a break from the code and it turns out all the frustrations i was having
    were caused by an incorrect normal vector. Instead of (0,0,1) i was using (1,1,0)
    yuck...


    Thanks again for such an informative site!'

    Thank you very much for your appreciation!


    Yes, a break is a very good idea when you run into a mysterious problem. Many
    times a problem will solve itself as soon as you leave your PC and cubicle, won''t
    it? Congratulations on that.


    I must admit I was mystified by your query as well, because I didn''t understand
    how the bounding box can ever be distorted into a parallelogram. I would have
    thought that by its very definition, it remains an orthogonal box under all circumstances.


    Normal vectors that are not normal are really nasty, aren''t they?  :-)


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    As of at least Revit 2015, the API for TextElement has properties BaseDirection
    and UpDirection that can be used to determine the rotation of text.
