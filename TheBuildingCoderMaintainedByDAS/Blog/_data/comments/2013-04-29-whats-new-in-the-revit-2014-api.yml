  body: 'Hello Jeremy,


    We have noticed that Revit 2014 is introducing a new way of managing the Lookup
    Table files: you can now embed the CSV file into the family using the "Manage"
    button, under Type Properties. Problem is: do we have access to that through the
    API?


    Thanks'

    Well spotted. Yes, indeed. Simply search above for CSV.

    Congratulation on getting around to this.


    Wow, rather late, though  :-)


    I would suggest looking at the most up-to-date version of the SDK, on the Revit
    Developer Centre:

    Well, again "the box stops at you" :)


    Yeah, my upgrade is kind of late. I have been working on the whole life cycle
    of subway for the past 8 months. All functionality are on Revit 2013, so I didn''t
    get time to upgrade until today.


    To share my good news with you, my work covers design, construction and maintenance.
    And I''m confident to say, the whole life cycle of BIM can be achieved depending
    on Revit.

    Wow, sincere congratulations on the huge achievement and that notable statement!


    Do you mean the ''box'' or the ''buck''?


    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buck_passing">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buck_passing</a>


    I am sure you discovered and solved numerous fascinating aspects and tips and
    tricks in that project.


    Did you make much use of the API?


    Would you care sharing with us?


    If you would like to put together a draft for a blog post, I would love to host
    it for you.


    Thank you!


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    Yeah, I mean ''Buck''. And I used it by mistake for a couple of times (shaming...)


    I made much use of Revit API. I spent more time on the stage of construction and
    maintenance than the stage of design. It''s a long story and I hope I can get
    time to make a draft for you. Maybe next month as I''m rushing for a release now.


    For a brief, I''m doing the similar thing as RIB iTWO (<a href="http://www.rib-software.com/en),">http://www.rib-software.com/en),</a>
    but on the platform of pure Revit.

  body: 'Dear Gina,


    Thank you for submitting your query as a comment and your appreciation. I''m glad
    you like it.


    Unfortunately, there is a huge amount that I do not know. Some can be gleaned
    from the development team, and the majority from the developer community. So I
    end up just funneling information around, it seems, which is actually pretty boring.


    You would be surprised to hear how many questions are unique to one single developer.


    Thus, you often need to DIY.


    In this case, I cannot really say anything at all specific.


    I hope the general standard advice will be of use:


    1. Take a deep and careful look at the project file using RevitLookup and all
    other available tools, especially the element lister and BimChecker, before adding
    an image.


    2. Add the image and take careful note of all the steps you performed.


    3. Repeat step 1 after adding the image.


    4. Use the detailed list of steps from item 2 and the differences between the
    results from items 1 and 3 to determine how you can perform the operation programmatically.


    I guess I must have repeated this message several thousand times by now, albeit
    possibly not so explicitly.


    I hope this helps.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'
