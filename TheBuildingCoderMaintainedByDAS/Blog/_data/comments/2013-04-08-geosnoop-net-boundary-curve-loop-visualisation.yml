  body: Hi Jeremy, How would you convert the List<Point[]> loops back to a any View?

    Thank you for your question.


    I would love to answer it.


    Unfortunately, I have no idea whatsoever what you mean.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: Hi Jeremy, sorry for the confusion, what I mean is instead of "graphics.DrawPath(
    pen, path );" drawing the lines to the a windows dialog, drawing the lines back
    in a Revit View, say plan or elevation? I have been playing with this and can
    get it to work sometimes to some Views, but not all views. Regards Chris

  body: "Dear Chris,\n\nOh, I see what you mean.\n\nSure, that is absolutely possible.\n\
    \nYou need model lines in model views, and detail lines in plan views. Each line\
    \ needs a sketch plane, and the line must lie in that plane. \n\nThe Creator class\
    \ in The Building Coder samples sets that up automatically for model lines:\n\n\
    <a href=\"https://github.com/jeremytammik/the_building_coder_samples/blob/master/BuildingCoder/BuildingCoder/Creator.cs\"\
    >https://github.com/jeremytammik/the_building_coder_samples/blob/master/BuildingCoder/BuildingCoder/Creator.cs</a>\n\
    \nIt would be more efficient to reuse the same sketch plane for all lines that\
    \ are coplanar instead of creating a new sketch plane for each line.\n\nCheers,\
    \ Jeremy.\n-----"
