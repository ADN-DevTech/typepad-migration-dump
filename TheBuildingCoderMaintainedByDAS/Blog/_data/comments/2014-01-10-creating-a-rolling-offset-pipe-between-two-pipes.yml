  body: 'Dear Jeremy

    How can I cancel the edit mode? When I start drawing a Floor for example, Revit
    prevents me from dragging another family type from the browser as long as I''m
    still in the modify mode (I''ll not be able to use any family until I press the
    (X) button in the modify tab). How can I do this with API.
