  body: 'Hi Jeremy,


    I need to install Revit 32 on a 64 bit machine (this is why: <a href="http://revit-programmer.blogspot.com/2009/06/debugging-with-revit-64-bit.html">http://revit-programmer.blogspot.com/2009/06/debugging-with-revit-64-bit.html</a>
    ) Do you know of a way of doing this?


    You really should take a proper holiday one day. i.e. leave the laptop at home!


    thanks!

  body: "Dear Ed,\n\nThank you for the good recommendation! I actually do take time\
    \ off without the laptop now and then as well. \n\nI am not aware of any way to\
    \ install 32 bit Revit 2010 on a 64 bit machine, unfortunately ... unless you\
    \ are running a 32 bit OS on it, of course  :-)\n\nEven more unfortunately, even\
    \ if you could, this would possibly not help you much with the issue you mention\
    \ in your blog post, because the Visual Studio 'Edit and Continue' debugging functionality\
    \ which worked fine in Revit 2009 add-ins does currently not do so in 2010. Very\
    \ sorry for the bad news. This issue is being looked at carefully by the development\
    \ team and we are aware of its importance for developers.\n\nThere only reliable\
    \ work-around I can currently suggest is to code and debug in VSTA, which allows\
    \ reedit and reexecute of code without restarting, then port to your external\
    \ command or other API application.\n\nAnother partial work-around that I currently\
    \ use is to run Revit inside of the Visual Studio debugger with my project opened,\
    \ like normal. If I really want to edit some of the source files and continue\
    \ debugging at the same time, I open the same project once again in another instance\
    \ of Visual Studio. \n\nI hope this helps.\n\nCheers, Jeremy.\n-----"
