    Sure thing. Should be similar to the above.

    How to set PVC as default pipe type instead of Standard.

    As i press ''PI'', PVC should come automatically in mouse pointer.


    Thanks & Regards,

  body: "Dear Nitin,\n\nThe Revit API does not provide any official method to determine\
    \ the default family type or pipe type to be used in subsequent calls prompting\
    \ the user to insert instances.\n\nA workaround for this issue was described for\
    \ wall types, though, by using a key press function \"CS\" for \"Create Similar\"\
    \ to define which wall type to use. \n\nIt is included in The Building Coder samples,\
    \ in the CmdPressKey command:\n\n<a href=\"http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2010/11/launching-a-revit-command.html\"\

  body: 'Hello Jeremy,


    I''m upgrading a project to the 2013 API. However, when the call to NewTakeoffFitting()
    is made I get an exception "InvalidOperationException: failed to insert takeoff"
    with no additional information. I upgraded the project in CreateTakeoffPipe.zip
    and see the same problem. These both work properly in 2012, is this something
    you have encountered? I haven''t had any luck finding any other information on
    this.'

  body: "Dear Daniel,\n\nFor the benefit of other readers, I repeat here what Saikat\
    \ found out from the development team in response to your ADN query:\n\n\"The\
    \ major change to 2013 is piping now uses routing preferences as the container\
    \ class for pipe types allowing multiple fittings to be referenced for the same\
    \ fitting type and size range. It now requires the routing preference to be setup\
    \ prior to using the pipe type. In the past if you loaded a fitting and there\
    \ was no fitting assigned in the pipe type for this case the tap it would try\
    \ to find one in the project to use it now only use the fittings defined in the\
    \ routing preference. Because no fitting was found to be placed the insert takeoff\
    \ would fail causing the exception. Try setting up the routing preference and\
    \ adding the spud to routing preference as the default tap prior to running the\
    \ command.\" \n\nThank you for confirming that this solves you problem.\n\nCheers,\
    \ Jeremy.\n-----"
