  body: Hey Jeremy, thanks for the update. Wondering if you know why the dwf export
    file sizes are bigger in 2013 than 2012. As an example, a 3D model exported to
    dwf from 2012 is 672kb, while the same model when migrated to 2013 and then exported
    comes up to 1.2mb. It is not a big deal, but just wondering if you noticed.

  body: "Dear KR,\n\nYes, indeed. \n\nThe DWF export is being continuously improved,\
    \ with new features and data added all the time.\n\nOne change made lately was\
    \ the export edges when exporting to 3D. That would add a fair amount of data.\n\
    \nExpect more to come.\n\nCheers, Jeremy.\n-----"
