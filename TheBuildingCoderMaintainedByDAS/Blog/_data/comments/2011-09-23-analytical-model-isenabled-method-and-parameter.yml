    Sorry that I took so long to get back to you.


    Have you had a look at this blog post?


    <a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2011/05/list-linked-files-and-transmissiondata.html">http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2011/05/list-linked-files-and-transmissiondata.html</a>


    In addition, Mike Caruso started a thread of comments on that post which includes
    some sample code on using the WriteTransmissionData method.


    I hope that helps. Please let me know!


    Thank you!


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    I wanted to do this anyway, and now your comment prompted me to finally go ahead
    and promote the comment I pointed to above to a blog post of its own:

    The Revit API provides no information at all about mouse movement. You will have
    to use the native Windows API or the .NET framework libraries for that.


    Cheers, Jeremy.
