  body: "Jeremy, \n\nI have been searching high and low for how we could do this.\
    \ Is this functionality at all on the developmental horizon for the Revit API\
    \ or will us 3rd party developers have to jump through hoops to accomplish this?\
    \ Is there a way to invoke something that may be exported from Revit.exe Picker.dll\
    \ or Graphics.dll to accomplish this until getpoint is actually implemented to\
    \ the API? I have been using the Autodesk APIs for about 18 years now starting\
    \ with lisp on R10, ads, arx and com, getpoint has always been available no matter\
    \ what API I was using."

  body: 'Dear Jim,


    Thank you for your query, which I completely understand and support. I brought
    your comment as well as another one in a similar vein by Greg McLaughlin to the
    development team''s attention, so they are highly aware of this issue and its
    importance to developers.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: 'Jeremy,

    I agree with Jim''s concerns and would like to add that not having the the ability
    to let the user pick a point in the API is one of the roadblocks to closing the
    technician efficiency gap between Revit and AutoCAD. It should be much more of
    a priority.'

  body: 'Dear Jason,


    Thank you for reinforcing the message. The development team are aware of the importance
    of this issue now.


    Please also be aware that trying to draw parallels between AutoCAD and Revit can
    become a hindrance to your thinking and development work. The paradigm is utterly
    different. It is extremely imporant to know and understand the Revit product,
    user interface and underlying philosophy well in order to create successful applications
    for it. You cannot build purely on AutoCAD experience, be it ever so extensive.
    And of course I fully agree that picking a point in the graphics screen is a fundamental
    useful feature, as proven by the Revit SDK samples mentioned above.


    Cheers, Jeremy.
