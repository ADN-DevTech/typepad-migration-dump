    got the Family document open, you can access  things like the material and subcategory
    at the solid level, which may give you something closer to what you want.


    I wouldn''t recommend it from a performance standpoint if you were querying across
    lots of families in the project. But on a limited family basis where you''re looking
    for something like a door leaf, it might make sense to do it that way - especially
    if the leaf itself is identifiable via subcategory.

  body: 'Dear Matt,


    Are you saying that it is possible to assign a material to a solid in the family
    editor?


    I do see interesting methods and properties such as GetMaterialArea, GetMaterialVolume
    and Materials on the GenericForm and its derived classes, which exist in the family
    context, but I do not see how the volume material can be queried in the project
    context?


    Cheers, Jeremy.
