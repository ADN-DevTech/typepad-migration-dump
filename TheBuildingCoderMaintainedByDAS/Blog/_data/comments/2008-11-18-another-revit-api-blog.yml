  body: 'Dear Prasad,


    Thank you for these interesting questions.


    You can create a new reference plane using the Document NewReferencePlane and
    NewReferencePlane2 methods. An example of using both of them is given by the Revit
    2010 SDK sample WindowWizard.


    The reference line is not yet fully exposed through the API, but the ModelCurve
    does provide a new method ChangeToReferenceLine which returns a reference curve
    or reference line for a given model curve or line. This method is also part of
    the new family API, and is thus applicable only to curves in conceptual mass families.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    Please have a look at the Document.NewDimension method. An example of using this
    is provided by the Revit SDK sample CreateDimensions.

    You cannot, as far as I know. I think Revit uses the Windows user name.
