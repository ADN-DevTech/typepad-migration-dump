  body: 'Hi Jeremy,


    I''m new to REVIT API, but was thinking about something:

    "Is there eny way of adding XData to the families, so that we can manipulate then
    later on AutoCAD, after the DWG export on Revit? "


    Thank you..

    Sure there is a possibility for a Revit add-in to add its own arbitrary data to
    Revit database elements. It is called ''shared parameters'' and is accessible
    both through the user interface and the API.


    I am not sure how well the shared parameter data will survive the export to AutoCAD,
    though. If all else fails, you can always implement your own export mechanism.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    Thank you for your appreciation. Glad you like it.


    No, I am not aware of any such information.


    Actually, it may even be hard to find within Revit itself.


    As an approximation in Revit, I would suggest iterating over all elements returned
    by a filtered element collector specific to the given view and summing up all
    their bounding boxes to obtain the model extents displayed by the view.


    The size of the view in paper space is easy to determine:
