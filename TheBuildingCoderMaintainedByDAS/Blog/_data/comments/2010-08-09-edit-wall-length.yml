    The only one who can really help you is you yourself.


    All I can tell you off-hand is that it is easy.


    You will probably need to use the PickObject method and access the element parameters

    They are listed in the Revit API help file RevitAPI.chm, provided with the Revit
    SDK, as described in the getting started material:

    Good luck!


    Cheers, Jeremy.
