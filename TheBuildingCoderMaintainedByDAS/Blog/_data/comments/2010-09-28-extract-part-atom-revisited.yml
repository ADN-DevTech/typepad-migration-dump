    Oh, yes, the report that I saw was indeed working on Windows 7. Thank you for
    pointing that out! I added a note on that above as well.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: A update to this, in 2011 on windows 7 only we have still had it fail on certain
    families that have formulas in them, once formulas are deleted the atom extractor
    runs correctly. I will be submitting to the dev team tomorrow for further investigation.

  body: 'Hi Jeremy,


    Kindly, I am getting a System.AccessViolationException when I try to execute this
    code:

    newFamInstElem = activedoc.Create.NewFamilyInstance(f, p, basisXYZ, elemFamSymb)

    -f is a Face of a wall element found in a linked revit file to the activedoc.
    f is not null

    -p is an XYZ point location on the face

    -basisXYZ is the X-axis

    -elemFamSymb is the new family instance symbol


    Please advise if this exception is due to the fact that am trying to access the
    face of a wall in a linked document & if there''s a solution to this issue.


    Thanks a lot..

    Best Regards,'

  body: 'Dear Mona,


    I am going on vacation in the next few days. If you prefer having an answer before
    I return ten days later, and if you want a guarantee for an answer at all, and
    someone who can take some time to investigate yuor issue in any depth, I would
    advise you to submit an ADN DevHelp Online request for it.


    Otherwise, we''ll see what I can do for you in November ... although I''ll probably
    be up to both ears in Autodesk University preparations by then  :-)


    Cheers, Jeremy.'
