    We had trouble with family instances that would not cut their host for years,
    and we tried lots of workarounds with varying results.

    Now, finally we know the reason for our problems and could fix them for good.'

    Congratulations on solving it, and sorry for all the hassles this caused you in
    the past. It really did require some in-depth analysis to discover the simple
    root cause.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    I forwarded your message and the email address that you used to submit it to the

    prefer.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    I was expecting the same issue while creating void elements for automatic cutting
    of walls to terrain. After lot of debugging my colleague gave me a tip to check
    your post. I think AutoDesk should make this a bit clearer in the API.'
