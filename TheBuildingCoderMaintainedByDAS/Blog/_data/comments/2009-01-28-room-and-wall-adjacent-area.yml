  body: 'Hi Jeremy,


    In the scope of my job, I have to determine all spaces adjacency with surrounding
    objects (walls, slabs, ...).


    To do that in the more generic manner, I''m using the space''s solid faces projection
    on surrounding objects, and 2D CSG intersection calculation (through GPC) to determine
    the contact areas.


    All information proposed in this blog have been invaluable for me to achieve my
    goals, and I want to thank you a thousand times for that ;o)


    The next step to that work is to display the resulting polygons in a purposely
    created 3D View.


    "FilledRegion" could have been a solution, but it seams to be restraint to the
    XY plan ...


    What kind of object can I use to display a closed planar face, bounded by a known
    polygon, in a specific 3D view ?


    Thanks ;o)'

    Thank you for your appreciation.


    I am very glad that this has all been useful to you.


    I hope you also noticed the post inspired by a colleague of yours, Jasper Desmet,
    who just finished his engineering studies and research project for his master
    thesis concerning heat load calculation using BIM software:

    You might even want to try to get in touch with him.


    Anyway, there are only two ways to display graphics in Revit:


    1. Define database elements, which is unwieldy and semi-criminal BIM misuse.


    2. use the Analysis Visualisation Framework AVF:

    Here is two specific usage examples:
