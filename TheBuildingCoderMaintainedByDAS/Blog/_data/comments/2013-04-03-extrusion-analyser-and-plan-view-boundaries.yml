  body: 'Hi Jeremy,


    thank you for testing this out.

    By the way, the ExporterIFCUtils class provides much more methods. One of them,
    SortCurveLoops, sorts curve loops according to the location.

    But also this method won''t concatenate the curves in the way you need, I think.



    Best regards,

    Rudolf'

    Thank you for your additional hint.


    Bettina Zimmermann pointed out a simple solution that *does* work and that she
    has already used, AsCurveFollowingFace:

    In general, information about things that *do* work is mostly more useful than
    anything else  :-)


    Cheers, Jeremy.
