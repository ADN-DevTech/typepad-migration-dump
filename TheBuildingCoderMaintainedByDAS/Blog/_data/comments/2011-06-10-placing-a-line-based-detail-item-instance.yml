  body: 'Hi Jeremy,

    I''ve been trying to place a line-based Generic model on the floor plan''s active
    workplane.  I thought "Reference, Line, FamilySymbol" would work but the Reference
    has to be to a face.  I''m not sure what then the difference is between "Reference,
    Line, FamilySymbol" and "Face, Line, FamilySymbol".  I tried using the level as
    reference but didn''t seem to work.  Any thoughts?  Thanks.'

    I can only repeat the same suggestion as always: explore how it works manually,
    look at the results and resulting relationships in RevitLookup.


    When working with families, it always helps to define such a family yourself so
    you understand it properly ''from the other end'' as well.


    You can test which NewFamilyInstance overload works by testing all possibilities
    like this:

    Here are other explorations in the area:

    Oh, and definitely do not forget to look at the family placement type property
    via Family.FamilyPlacementType.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: Thanks Jeremy, I missed your overloads post and it helped.  Using "Curve,
    FamilySymbol, Level, StructuralType" worked for my line-based Generic Model component.

  body: 'Jeremy,

    When you use the term line-based details, are you talking about the two point
    click detail component family? I am using a standard detail component in a view
    and the component is being rotated cyclicly every 4 elevation views within the
    same elevation mark. is this anything to do with my detail family template not
    being line-based?


    cheers,
