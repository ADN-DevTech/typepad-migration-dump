  body: 'Dear Vincent,


    That sounds like a very cool project indeed, and I will be very happy to support
    you in that, even cooperate completely.


    I have not done anything further at all with this since the Brussels Hackathon.


    I would like to explore using Heroku to implement and host a cloud project:


    <a href="https://www.heroku.com">https://www.heroku.com</a>


    It is free for small projects.


    I would like to use Node.js and MongoDB. Heroku supports heaps of other options
    as well.


    So, as far as ElasticSearch is concerned, I do not have much to offer.


    Regarding the mining of strings from a Revit project, you might be interested
    in the StringSearch add-in:

    Please let me know how you decide to continue with this and whether you would
    like to do something together.


    Thank you!


    Cheers, Jeremy.
