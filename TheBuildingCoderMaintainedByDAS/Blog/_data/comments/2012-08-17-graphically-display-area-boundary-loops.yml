  body: 'Hi JEREMY

    I faced a question about to fetch Room boundaries.

    If I create wall with multiple structure and multiple core boundary,and set the
    room area calculation to "core wall center",then the room just seen like this

    ,but in your snippet code I just only get all Center of the wall line instead,how
    can I get the "Core wall center" line ??


    Thanks.


    Regards,

  body: 'Dear Rick,


    I believe that internally, Revit always considers the wall location to be in the
    wall center, and there is nothing you can do to change that.


    Things that you do in the user interface to change the UI ''wall location" have
    no effect on the API ''wall location''.


    Same applies to the area calculation. It only affects the UI.


    So, to obtain the center line of the wall core, you have to calculate and apply
    the appropriate offset yourself.


    I discussed that once in the distant past, in one of the very first posts, and
    I think it still applies:

    I am not aware of any changes affecting this in the Revit 2014 API.


    The following might provide some additional ideas, though:

    i am confused about how to write the arguments for 2014 version.


    Next.I would then like to extrude the lines to create room extrusions.


    It seems so confusing how to create classes and variables for revit.'

    As you have certainly discovered by now, you can simply ignore that message for
    the moment. It is only a warning.


    Fixing it is easy, though:


    doc.Create.NewSketchPlane( levelPlane )


    turns into


    SketchPlane.Create( doc, levelPlane )


    Regarding the extrusions, you have two options:


    1. Create an appropriate extrusion family and insert an instance of it:

    2. Create a DirectShape element:

    Sorry about the confusion.


    Have you worked through the getting started material, especially the DevTV and
    My First Revit Plugin tutorials?

    Here is another recent note on getting started:
