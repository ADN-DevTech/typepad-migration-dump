  body: 'Dear Ahmed,


    Thank you for your question! As far as I know, the API will not provide access
    to the underlying GenericForm instances in a FamilyInstance object. GenericForm
    and its derived classes Blend, Extrusion, Revolution and Sweep are all subclasses
    of Autodesk.Revit.Element, i.e. database elements. The geometrical analysis provides
    access to non-database in-memory objects provided in the Revit Geometry namespace.
    The shapes defined parametrically by the GenericForm are interpreted by the Revit
    engine and the resulting geometry is returned by the API in geometrical objects,
    above all solids. I will happily continue exploring how to access and analyse
    these solids in future posts. The recent post on Family Instance Materials shows
    how to traverse into the solids defined by family instances. In that example,
    we simply extract the material information from the solid faces and ignore the
    transformations of the symbol geometry into the instance position in world coordinate
    space. In a future post, I plan to discuss that transformation as well. I hope
    that will answer your question.


    Best regards,


    Jeremy
