    First I want to say that I really appreciate all of the excellent information
    provided on The Building Coder.


    Now, I have a question.  First, I''m not sure if there is an official way to ask
    one.  I searched around and didn''t find anything that looked like a place to
    pose one.  If there is, please feel free to point it out, and I will gladly re-post
    my question there.


    I did quite a bit of searching, both in the samples and on the internet, and couldn''t
    come up with anything.


    Using the API, I have a need to generate a DXF floor plan from the Revit model
    (project) that contains a closed polyline boundary of the outside of the building
    walls (the building gross area boundary).  I have found export options to generate
    polyline boundaries for rooms and areas, but I can''t find anything to generate
    one for the outside of the exterior wall.  It would be nice to do the inside of
    the exterior wall too.


    Any information you can provide on how I would go about that would really help.


    Thank you again, for all of the great information and discussion you provide.


    Ed'

    Thank you for your appreciation. I am very glad The Building Coder has proved
    useful for you.


    Submitting your query here as a comment is perfectly ok.


    Alternatively, you can also use the Revit API discussion forum to get help from
    the entire ADN team plus the entire external add-in developer community, or the
    ADN DevHelp online to ask us directly:

    I can think of a number of ways to approach the task you describe. It depends
    on your exact needs.


    What support does the user interface offer for this? It is always best to follow
    that lead, if you can.


    Do you care at all how the DXF file is structured?


    By the way, why does it have to be DXF at all?


    You just need to access the closed polygon data, don''t you?


    Then you can do whatever you want with it, including but not limited to exporting
    it to DXF.


    Can you provide a minimal reproducible case to test?

    Cheers, Jeremy.
