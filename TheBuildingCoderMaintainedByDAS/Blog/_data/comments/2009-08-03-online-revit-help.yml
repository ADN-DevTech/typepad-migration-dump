  body: 'Dear Rod,


    Yes it is great indeed, isn''t it? I think your idea is great as well and makes
    perfect sense. Since you are an ADN member, could you log a DevHelp Online request
    for this functionality, please, so I have a case to link the request to? Thank
    you!


    I tried out your custom search engine, and it seems to work absolutely wonderfully,
    doing exactly what I would wish it to. Congratulations!


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: 'We need help regarding extracting data from parameter

    What happen when we extract these data for example

    The value of pipe flow 15.0 GPM in Revit  MEP  when exported to excel it become
    like (0.033420141)

    Why this change?? I need it to be extracted as 15.0 GPM and so on

    Please advise'

  body: "Dear Ahmed,\n\nFirst of all, congratulations on successfully exporting your\
    \ data to Excel  :-)\n\nYou question has to do with the Revit internal database\
    \ units. Please see the explanations in \n\n<a href=\"http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2008/09/units.html\"\
    >http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2008/09/units.html</a>\n\nand \n\n<a\

    \nRevit allows the user to define different units to display in the user interface,\
    \ for instance the 15.0 GPM that you are seeing in Revit MEP. Internally, however,\
    \ Revit always uses a fixed set of database units which cannot be changed. The\
    \ number you see in the API is in internal database units. You need to determine\
    \ a conversion factor between the two. An easy way to do so is to set the parameter\
    \ to a value of 1.0 GPM through the user interface and then check what the resulting\
    \ internal database value is through the API, or using RvtMgdDbg.\n\nYou can also\
    \ use the powerful unit conversion tool to calculate the required conversion factor:\n\

    Congratulations on solving the debugging issue!


    Thank you very much for submitting the ADN DevHelp Online case. That is always
    much more reliable than posting a comment on the blog, since ADN guarantees that
    you receive an answer.


    The parent to children relationship is maintained in the MapParentToChildren dictionary,
    which is simply a Dictionary>. It is described in detail in the source code comments
    on the MapParentToChildren class definition.


    You can simply iterate over the dictionary and extract the information from there.


    Alternatively, you can completely skip the instantiation and population of this
    dictionary and implement the data export directly.


    Cheers, Jeremy.
