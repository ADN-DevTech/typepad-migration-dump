  body: 'From a content perspective it would be better to make the bound box visible
    at Course Level of detail, and detailed geometry not visible at Course and then
    vice versus, bounding box invisible at Medium and Fine, and detailed geometry
    visible. This makes for useful content for the end user, a bit off topic but I
    thought it was worth mentioning.


    Of course, once you''ve found the bounding box it would not be so hard to change
    its properties.'

  body: 'Dear Igor,


    The Revit API does not provide anything specific in that direction. You simply
    use the standard .NET framework functionality, above all the stuff provided in
    the System.Windows.Forms namespace. There are numerous samples making use of this
    functionality to create their own forms, buttons and dropdowns in the Revit SDK
    and the ADN sample material. Please examine that. You might want to start by looking
    at the getting started category:

    Here is the last update on this subject:

    Here is a sample making more hardcore use of System.Windows.Forms functionality
    to create its own form completely programmatically on the fly:

    You can create buttons and drop down combo boxes analogously.


    Cheers, Jeremy.
