  body: 'Hi Jeremy,

    Thanks for your efforts, they are really appreciated by lots of us lurkers. Secondly,
    do you know that there are only 3 countries left using imperial measures: USA,
    Burma and Liberia (which is transitioning). Time to get with the program guys...

    Regards, Dale'

    Thank you for your appreciation!


    Really? Wow, I was not aware of that! Impressive!


    Well, never fix a running system, they say, don''t they?


    Very few people are able to hold themselves back and really stick that wisdom,
    while others (myself included) waste their effort fixing things that still run  :-)


    Cheers, Jeremy.'
