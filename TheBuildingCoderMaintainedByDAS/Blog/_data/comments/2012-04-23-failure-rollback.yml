  body: 'hi Jeremy,


    refer to Roll Back Failure Suppressing all messages, Mario''s solution is great,
    most of the warning messages are gone except a few, is it normal or did i miss
    something?

    i even used failuresAccessor.DeleteAllWarnings(); maybe it''s because i have only
    one transaction w/ multiple start() + commit() for different cases of the elements
    modification, should i use sub-tranaction or something else?


    also, is there a way to supress Error messages too, i mean accept default?


    cheers w/ many thanks,


    Ning'
