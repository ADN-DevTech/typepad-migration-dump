  body: "Jeremy,\n\nI have run into an issue a few times while attempting to <b>PromptForFamilyInstancePlacement</b>,\
    \ when there are multiple types (symbols) for a family, occasionally a user attempts\
    \ to select a different symbol.  \n\nSeems like the easiest way to solve this\
    \ is to create a dialog with a list of symbols for that specific family (for easy\
    \ selection).  It just seems like there should be an easier way to load a different\
    \ type \"on the fly\" if a user decides to select something different after the\
    \ fact.  Am I expecting too much?  Thanks."

    Can you place the symbol manually?


    You need to find out which NewFamilyInstance overload is suitable for your specific
    family:

    Yes, sorry, currently there is no way that I know of to programmatically control
    default type that gets placed by this method. We are working on it, though  :-)

  body: 'Dear Dhiraj,


    You can try going the other way:


    Instead of starting by placing the pipe, and then adding fittings, you could place
    the fittings at the correct locations without any pipes at all.


    Then when you call the API methods to connect the fittings with each other, the
    intermediate pipes may be placed automatically.

  body: 'Hi Jeremy,

    I wish to place the instance of a family object once i click a button. I need
    some replacement for the method "PromptForFamilyInstancePlacement" . It should
    not prompt user in UI to place the instance on a phase. It should prompt the user
    to select the 2 or more multpile phase and then it should place it in the joining
    point of the selected phases. Is this possible in API programming?'

    Another interesting and very useful article.

    I have utilised some of your code above to create an icon/image driven system
    where families are presented in a dialogue. I have everything working almost exactly
    as I need it with the exception of one thing. When I select an image in my dialogue
    my dialogue form has focus. I then need to click in my Revit model twice (once
    for it to regain focus, again to place the family) Is there any way I can programmatically
    give focus back to the Revit Model/document.

    Thank you for your update and appreciation.


    I am very glad you find it useful.


    For one thing, your form should set Revit as its parent window.


    To see how, search for JtWindowHandle


    <a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?q=JtWindowHandle">http://lmgtfy.com/?q=JtWindowHandle</a>


    Here is a current implementation of this trivial wrapper class:


    <a href="https://github.com/jeremytammik/RoomEditorApp/blob/master/RoomEditorApp/JtWindowHandle.cs">https://github.com/jeremytammik/RoomEditorApp/blob/master/RoomEditorApp/JtWindowHandle.cs</a>


    As you can see, it is used in my RoomEditorApp.


    With that in place, I think your problem should disappear immediately.


    If not, the RoomEditorApp also includes code to explicitly set the foreground
    window.


    Try not to use it, though, since that is something the user should retain control
    over.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: 'Jeremy,

    I want to load some mass instances from one file(the store file) to another file(the
    proj. file) in revit arch. 2013. I know there is a new method copy and paste between
    open documents in the same session however i would have to reference the 2014
    api, which I cant at the moment. I think that I would have to do this by loading
    mass families (12 of them) onto the same x,y coordinates simultaneously. Is this
    even possible? Could you provide tips to achieve this?

    Many thanx,

    Nik'

  body: 'Dear Nik,


    Yes indeed, the copy and paste API sounds appropriate and was introduced in Revit
    2014.


    The other approach you suggest sounds perfectly feasible as well for this simple
    case.


    Yes, I believe this is possible.


    As usual, you should try it out through the user interface first.


    Placing multiple overlapping instances might cause errors or warnings, and you
    may have to use the failure API to handle those.

    Do you know of a method of obtaining the families file path without using editFamily

    Look in the archive file FamilyApi10.zip in the third and final part of the detailed
    discussion on use of the Family API:

    Good luck getting started with the Revit API!


    Have you worked through the getting started material, especially the ''My First
    Plugin'' and DevTV tutorials?


    <a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/about-the-author.html#2">http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/about-the-author.html#2</a>


    Have you installed RevitLookup? An absolute must!


    Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to you!
