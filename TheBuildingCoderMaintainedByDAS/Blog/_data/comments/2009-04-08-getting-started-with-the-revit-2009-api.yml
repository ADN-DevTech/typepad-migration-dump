  body: 'hi,


    I have built the application in VS 2008 Express edition and Revit 2010.

    when I run the application through the code it opens Revit. Now If I try to Open
    the Project the revit closes and the code stops running.

    has any one faced this problem, or I am going wrong any where.


    Thanks,


    KK'

    One thing that is easily and often wrong is leaving the ''Copy Local'' flag on
    the reference to RevitAPI.dll set to its default value of True. You need to set
    it to False to run Revit with your add-in.


    Cheers and good luck, Jeremy.'

    You can access that property via the built-in parameter FUNCTION_PARAM on the

    An exampe of this is given in the method IsExterior in

    Sure it is possible. You can use any language you want. My preference is mostly
    C#, but you can just as well use VB or managed C++ or any other language supporting
    the .NET framework:


    <a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2010/07/visual-studio-2010-and-the-net-framework.html">http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2010/07/visual-studio-2010-and-the-net-framework.html</a>


    Same thing for the database, you can connect any database that you like to Revit,
    as long as it provides an API to drive it programmatically.


    You are completely free in all your choices!

  body: 'Hi Jeremy,


    I have quite an extensive experience in Revit though I still like and am using
    Revit 2009.


    In our typical projects, we insert quite a lot of generic models or if you like,
    families for the purpose of scheduling and then we tag them and adjust their position
    separately. While Revit allows us to use the "tag all" I wonder if we can see
    the model or family pre-tagged as we are inserting them as the user needs to identify
    visually what is being placed in the project. Is there a way of achieving this
    even if it is through an API?


    Appreciate your response!


    Thanks'

    \ to me as if one powerful way to achieve what you need could be implemented using\
    \ the DMU or dynamic model update. \n\nIt enables you to register an updater that\
    \ reacts to specific changes in the model, so that for instance each insertion\
    \ of a suitable family instance could trigger an updater to automatically tag\
    \ it appropriately.\n\nOh no, that is Revit 2012. Sorry. Hmm, nope, for Revit\
    \ 2009 I have no idea. Good luck!\n\nCheers, Jeremy."
