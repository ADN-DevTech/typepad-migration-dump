    Thank you for the appreciation. I do not think that the development team have
    been convinced yet that anything needs changing, though.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: I do hope they come up with some way to achieve smaller objects. It's especially
    frustrating when working with annotation objects which get scaled automatically.
    Try to have some kind of detail when working on a scale of 1/200!! It's impossible.

  body: 'Sorry to comment so long after the fact, but you came up on a Google search
    so...


    What do you know about specifying a length of zero? I have a family involving
    a variable number of tieback elements that I''d like to be able to schedule the
    length of. Visibility is no issue, I can make the tiebacks not used on a particular
    element invisible, but the smallest I can set their length to is 1", less leads
    to a "can''t create type" error. In larger projects this can lead to significant
    extra tieback length on our schedules. Any thoughts?'

  body: 'Dear Arlo,


    The late comment is no problem at all, don''t worry.


    Yes, I am sorry about this minimum length dimension limit imposed by Revit. As
    you saw above, this restriction is causing significant problems for others as
    well. There may well be objects used in buildings that really do need to be modelled
    accurately with dimensions below this limit. Unfortunately, you will have to make
    do with some workaround such as letting them appear larger than they really are.
    Sorry for that.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    No, sorry, no idea, I have not worked on Navisworks export myself.


    Please let us know how you resolve this. Thank you!
