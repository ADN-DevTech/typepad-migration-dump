  body: 'Dear Dan,


    You can attach extensible storage data to any element in the Revit database?


    Is the document an element in the Revit database?


    I would say no.


    In the past, I would have said ''use the singleton Project Information element''.


    You can use it as a representative element for the document itself.


    I have since learnt better.


    There are good reasons not to fiddle with the Project Information element in a
    worksharing environment.


    It would affect everybody else''s files and all elements, in a way.


    You want to limit your modifications (and therefore extensible storage) to an
    element that affects as few files and other elements as possible.


    A simple choice for that is the DataStorage element.


    It was designed specifically as a container for extensible storage data and nothing
    else, and affects no other files and elements.


    I hope this helps.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    It seems that there is no more issue with the Revit API shipped with Revit 2015
    R2.

    Could you please confirm that it has been solved and that we no longer need to
    worry about ?


    Thanks a lot.


    Best regards.

    Yes, indeed, it should be happily fixed by now in Revit 2015 R2.


    There is apparently still an issue with Revit 2015 UR5, though, that is currently
    being looked at.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    Thanks a lot for your answer.

    BTW, if we have R2 installed, do we have to install UR5 ? I know R2 almost corresponds
    to UR4..., but what about UR5 ?

    Thanks.

  body: 'Dear Maxime,


    As far as I know, there are two separate UR5 patches for Revit 2015 and Revit
    2015 R2.


    We are also expecting a UR6 for Revit 2015 very soon now, by the way, to incorporate
    the issue REVIT-57015 [Revit 2015 UR4 extensible storage fix prevents loading
    or editing family], which I believe was fixed by UR5 in Revit 2015 R2, but not
    in Revit 2015.


    Very sorry for the confusing state of affairs.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    Since users and the dev team all have R2 installed, everybody can update to R2
    UR5 with no damage regarding this point ?
