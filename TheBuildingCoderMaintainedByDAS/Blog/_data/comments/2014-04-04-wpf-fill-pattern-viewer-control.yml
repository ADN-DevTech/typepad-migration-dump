  body: 'Dear Jeremy,


    I am developing a hatch generator as a programming exercise. Using a pat-file
    limits the total segment length of a fill pattern to 100 feet. Using the API you
    can define patterns of greater length, and thus greater accuracy. However the
    preview window of the fill pattern dialog doesn''t show these patterns, so perhaps
    segment length greater than 100 feet is not the intended use.


    I have 2 questions:

    -  Could I safely use these patterns?

    -  Can the WPF Fill Pattern Viewer Control display these patterns?


    Have a nice day,

    Frank'

  body: 'Dear Frank,


    That sounds brilliant.


    Congratulations on creating such a powerful and fun tool as a programming exercise.


    I cannot answer either of your question, and quite possibly nobody else in the
    entire universe can either.


    It is up to you, I think.


    I am very interested in hearing what you find out, and would love to publish your
    tool if you are willing to share it.


    Thank you!


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    I remember I spent a lot of time to understand what does fill grids and fill segments
    mean and how to create the graphics of fill patterns using that numbers:)


    But as I remember there is a performance issue with the complex fill pattern,
    like ''Sand'', what have a lot of fill grids. The control is significantly slows
    when creating graphics for such pattern.


    Anyway, the control works and the performance was enough for my task.


    I didn''t remember why I didn''t share with the control when I created it:)


    Alex, thanks for sharing and what you dind''t forget to mention the author, i.e.
    me:)'

    Nice to hear from you!


    Oops. I''m sorry and happy we surprised you. I hope it was pleasant in the end  :-)


    I wonder whether I should add the performance warning to the main post to ensure
    it gets seen, or just leave it here in the comments for people to discover for
    themselves.


    I think the latter, actually.


    Thank you again for your nice implementation and these further details.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: 'Hi Jeremy,


    I think we may create simple benchmark and see how much time needs to create the
    simple and complex pattern. :)


    I even would say that the performance is slow when you show the list of the complex
    patterns. When only single complex patten is displayed, decrease in performanse
    is barely noticeable.


    Regards,

    Victor.
