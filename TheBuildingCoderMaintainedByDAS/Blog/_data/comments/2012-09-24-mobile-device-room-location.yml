    I work as a Revit Systems Manager with a large retailer, and we have been looking
    at ways of solving a similar problem - how to work out where a customer or product
    is located in one of over 800 stores; aach store being a 100-150MB Revit file...


    We have started looking at DWF as a lighter and easier dataset to access, and
    it contains the same room data as Revit; record a location or path as a markup
    in DWF, then pull that back into Revit.


    Its only one option we are looking at, and its very early days for us!


    Love your blog by the way, I''m still a beginner with the Revit API, but I find
    your insights very useful.

    That''s an amazing project!


    I''m working on a digital platform for a Industrialized Housing system. What you
    just described is a typical scenario of its lean-agile workflow chain. Looking
    forward to your progress on it.


    On the other hand, I have a question on ViewSchedule. In some cases I need to
    insert customized layout table into my view sheet. So I need to control the schedule
    format via Revit API. However, I cannot find way to group ScheduleFields via Revit
    API, although it has intuitive button "Group"/"Ungroup" on panel of "Modify Schedule/Quantities"
    panel.


    Futher more, sometimes I need a table as flexible as EXCEL. As current version
    of ViewSchedule cannot afford, I have to draw line and insert text to generate
    a table family and insert instance of it. I wrote some code to automates this
    work. But it can only cover the formats I encountered so far, and definitely needs
    modification for new formats which I cannot foresee at this moment.


    Do you have any suggestion for me about the "flexible format table"? Thanks a
    lot!

  body: 'Dear David,


    Glad you like it.


    Nope, sorry, the view schedule formatting is still kind of limited, so all I can
    suggest at the moment is doing what you already: fiddling with lines and stuff
    in Revit, or moving it out of Revit to some external report.


    Here is a real early example of doing that, before the advent of the electrical
    panel schedules:

  body: 'Dear Rudolf,


    That sounds like a nice idea, for sure.


    I''ll probably be looking at making the project smaller rather than larger, though  :-)


    Suggest something to reduce the scope, please  :-)


    Or do you happen to have some code handy to create nice colour-fill screen snapshots
    of every room?


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    sorry for making the second step before the first one.


    Just cannot stop exploring the possibilities.

  body: 'Hi Jeremy,


    for the room pictures, you could create images from either whole floor plans or
    single rooms.


    For single rooms, first zoom in:


    ActiveUIDocument.ShowElements(room);

    (here you could need a dialog closer for the "searching for good view" dialog
    which appears if there is no opened view for our room)


    After zoomed in, export the picture:


    ImageExportOptions ieo = new ImageExportOptions();

    ieo.ExportRange = ExportRange.VisibleRegionOfCurrentView;

    ieo.FilePath = yourfilepath;

    etc. (e.g. modify resolution)


    ActiveUIDocument.Document.ExportImage(ieo);


    Since there could be several vaild views of a room, you cannot be sure that the
    room is displayed in the correct area scheme since this is view depending.


    For images of whole viewplans, the ImageExportOptions must be modified:


    ieo.ExportRange = ExportRange.CurrentView;




    Cheers,

  body: 'Hi Jeremy,


    Thanks for your confirmation that I''m on the right track. I used to concern that
    I had reinvented wheels :-)


    You link about the "UK Electrical Schedule Sample" is kind of close to my another
    idea of the my "Revit Table Functionality":

    1. Use defines table format in EXCEL, which is powerful in table format.

    2. Revit Add-in reads the table format and draw a table family by drawing lines
    and inserting text.

    3. Create a family instance of the table family

    4. Populate the table family instance by inserting data text


    It''s just an idea (maybe navie) at this moment because it''s kind of complex.
    And it seems more promising to wait for Revit API to expose more Schedule functions.

    I am hoping that basic schedule formatting functionality will become available
