  body: 'Hi Jeremy,


    This isn''t directly related to this, but I couldn''t find a better place to post...


    I''m trying to figure out if there is a way to change the workplane of a workplane
    based family via API.  I can find the workplane parameter but all I can get out
    of it is the string value and can''t set it.  I also don''t see any methods to
    rehost to a new workplane.  Is this possible?


    Thanks,

    Steve'

    It sounds to me as if it is not possible, unfortunately.

    No, sorry, I have not updated it nor heard of anyone else doing so. People continue
    making use of this basic technique, though, so it should certainly work:

    What problem do you observe?

    temporary transaction trick is great, but i noticed that group instance(s) is
    perhaps an exception(?), for instance, if i delete a level, then group instance(s)
    based on that level won''t be listed in the "deleted" element list, well, i have
    to use separate group filter to add these group instances into the "deleted" element
    list, perhaps i missed something?


    Cheers,

  body: furthermore, if i rehost that group instance to another level, then all IDs
    are changed (both group ID and group member IDs), even unique IDs are changed
    too, any tricks to deal w/ group in API, especially when rehost multiple group
    instances to another level? thanks, Ning

    Thank you for your appreciation. I am glad it helped.


    Oh dear, yes, the groups may well be an exception. Glad to hear you know how to
    handle it.

    Wow, all the unique ids are changed, even the members'' ones? That sounds pretty
    spectacular.


    Nope, I am not aware of any such tricks, but it sounds as if a toolkit for dealing
    with this would be pretty useful.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: thanks Jeremy, i figured out that if not a single member of group instance
    is sit on the level to be deleted, then it really doesn't matter if group instance
    is sit on that level or not, well, this also solved the (unique) ID issue as i
    mentioned in previous message, because i do not have to rehost group instances
    before processing them (ungroup and swap as you described before).

    Thank you for the good news! Glad that you found at least a partial solution.


    So what happens to the group instance on a level that is deleted? Do you simply
    move it to a different level, or what? Before or after deleting the level?


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: "thanks Jeremy,\n\n2 cases of group instance sit on the level to be deleted:\n\
    1) if no member sits on that level then that group instance will remain even after\
    \ level is already deleted\n2) if at least one member sits on that level then\
    \ that group instance will be deleted too after level is deleted \n\nso basically\
    \ i only have to check if any member of that group instance sits on that level,\
    \ won't have to rehost group instance at all as i previously did which will eventually\
    \ changed (unique) IDs before i start using ungroup and swap.\n\nCheers,\n\nNing\n\
