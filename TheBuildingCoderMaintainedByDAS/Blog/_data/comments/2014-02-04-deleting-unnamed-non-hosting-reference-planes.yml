    How to retain reference planes where other elements are aligned & locked (not
    hosted)?'

  body: 'Dear Jolish,


    I have not tested that. Please let us know whether such elements automatically
    prevent deletion of the reference plane or not. Otherwise, I would suggest giving
    such reference planes a name to prevent deletion, unless you can come up with
    a better suggestion.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    Locked elements does not prevent deleting reference planes. Best way as you suggested
    give name for all. Still wonder where the locked elements ids are saved? And Who
    stores that (reference plane or locked wall)? Tried snoop, no luck.'

  body: I've done a further test and unnamed refplanes that cut elements are also
    deleted. Therefore these must be named also. It's a shame the element being affected
    by refplanes does not list the ids of refplanes it is affected by on some property
    of its associated class. If it did you could go through a list of common model
    categories and build up a list of refplane ids to leave alone. Or alternatively
    the refplane itself could have a property stating if it is influencing other items.

  body: "If you lock an item to a refplane then it seems to add a dimension object\
    \ (which gets listed in the deleted ids list when the refplane is deleted). Therefore\
    \ in the case of finding unnamed refplanes that lock elements to planes you can\
    \ use the old trick of creating a sub-transaction to delete the refplane and if\
    \ the resulting element ID count is greater than 1 then you can roll back the\
    \ sub transaction to look through the element ids (finding 1 dimension object\
    \ for each lock). Obviously the dimensions in the list could also be user created\
    \ ones rather than those automatically created by locking planes. However I've\
    \ noticed their categories are different i.e. \"Dimensions\" (-2000260) for user\
    \ created linear dimensions and \"Constraints\" (-2000262) for linear dims formed\
    \ by locking elements to a plane. You could take the view that you don't want\
    \ to delete a refplane if it has a dimension associated with it anyway. The other\
    \ difference is the 'Value' property of a system created linear dimension is 'nothing'\
    \ not 0 or greater. \nNone of this addresses unnamed ref planes used for cuts.\n\
