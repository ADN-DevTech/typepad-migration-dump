    stream and making it better!

    Thank you very much for submitting it in the first place!


    I enjoyed dissecting it so systematically, hoping that this makes it even easier
    to understand and reuse.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: 'Jeremy,


    Now that you know where Revit is located, maybe you could use the System.Diagnostics.FileVersionInfo
    to determine what build you have.  Then hook it up to some (perhaps non-existent)
    Autodesk web service that lets us know if it''s the latest.  Tossing out ideas...


    Thanks!'

  body: 'Dear Danny,


    That would be one possibility. Doesn''t the product already check to see if updates
    are available during start-up (if enabled by customer)? I noticed that such a
    check is performed to get the most recent update during installation.


    If I understand the mechanism correctly, this is should be even better than what
    you suggest, because Revit will always get the latest service pack or user release,
    ensuring that customers can always be current.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: Unless we've turned that functionality off, yes, the update mechanism works
    as expected.  Our users aren't allowed to install their own updates however, so
    we've disabled that.

  body: 'Dear Danny,


    Oh, I see. You are an ADN member, aren''t you? Would you like to submit a DevHelp
    Online request and explain the exact functionality that you require? It will also
    be very helpful if you can add a business case to that, so we can file a request
    for this functionality and explain the motivation for it. Thank you!


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: Hi Danny, I work in Revit SWD on the API, so this update stuff was a bit new
    to me, too. However, a quick look shows that it is working through the communication
    center. My production copy of Revit shows in the communication center that an
    update is available, but has not tried to automatically install it... That's what
    you are after, right? Just knowing about the update rather than getting it forced
    on you.... This can be toggled on/off easily the commjunication center settings
    dialog. Hope it helps, Kevin

  body: 'Hi Jeremy,


    Thanks.  I wasn''t suggesting the build info as a need, but merely as an example
    of expanding this code sample with some more useful information, and an illustration
    of tapping into a useful portion of the framework that people may not be aware
    of.  No need for anything further.


    Thanks again,

    -Danny
