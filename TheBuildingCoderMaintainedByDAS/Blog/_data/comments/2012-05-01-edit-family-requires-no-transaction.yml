    Nope, no idea.


    Why don''t you benchmark it yourself and let us know?

  body: 'I think this is another example of the transaction discussion previously.
    Consideration of discreet transactions or in someways a ''unit of work'' is clearly
    much more important in the design of commands for R13 and beyond.


    In addition to Arnost''s recommendation of scoping transactions maybe it''s time
    to recommend using the Manual transaction mode only and the removal of Automatic
    mode. This would pave the way for removing the transaction and regeneration attributes
    all together.

  body: 'Dear Guy,


    I fully agree, and practiced exactly what you suggest at the Revit API training
    in Munich last week, with one small caveat:


    I personally never use automatic transaction mode, but I do use both the manual
    and read-only ones.


    It would actually be interesting to know the exact difference between an external
    command using read-only mode and one using manual without opening any transactions.

    First of all, Automatic Transaction Mode is considered obsolete, and we (Autodesk.Revit)
    do not recommend using it for new external applications. It only exists to ensure
    compatibility with older applications. The Automatic mode has many limitations
    (for what an external command can or cannot do), while it  has virtually no benefits
    whatsoever. It is somehow likely it will go away in some future release of Revit.


    Real-Only transaction mode does two things (well, it’s one thing, really, but
    I’ll split it.) For one, the command using it cannot have any transactions and
    may not call any methods that modify a document, directly or indirectly, or even
    temporarily. Secondly, while this external command is being executed, nobody else
    is allowed to modify the document or have a transaction either; that includes
    Revit itself, but also applies to other applications that might be invoked through
    events (for example). All this basically guarantees that during the entire execution
    of the external command the current models stays unmodified.

    Cool, edifying, and very clear!


    I promoted your answer to a post of its own to ensure it does not go unnoticed:
