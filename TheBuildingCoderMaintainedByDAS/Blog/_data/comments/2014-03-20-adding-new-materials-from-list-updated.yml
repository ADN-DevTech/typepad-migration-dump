  body: I have built the solution and created an XLSX file.  The addin runs and says
    that it has added materials, but I don't see them in the Material Browser in 2014.  Can
    you please provide an example of the Excel file so that I can ensure the formatting
    I'm using is correct?

  body: 'Hi Jeremy,

    Not sure if this is an off topic related to the post but is there a way we can
    use the API to introduce or add new Surface patterns (our own ones aside from
    the built-in ones) for a particular mass surface?

    cheers,
