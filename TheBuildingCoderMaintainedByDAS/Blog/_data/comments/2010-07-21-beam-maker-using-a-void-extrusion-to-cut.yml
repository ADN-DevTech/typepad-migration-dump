    how can I do interference check through the API?

    since the Revit application provide a tool "Interference Check",

    but what can we do it through the API?'

  body: "Dear Jarico, \n\nUnfortunately, there is no direct programmatic access to\
    \ the built-in Revit Interference Check command.\n\nThe Revit API does provide\
    \ some lower level interference checking methods, which are described in the following\
    \ post and the previous ones that it points to:\n\n<a href=\"http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2010/06/intersection-between-elements.html\"\
    >http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2010/06/intersection-between-elements.html</a>\n\
    \nIt would be possible to build a full interference checking tool using those\
    \ methods. For an example of two such tools for specialised cases, please have\
    \ a look at the Revit SDK samples AvoidObstruction and FindColumns.\n\nCheers,\
    \ Jeremy."

    Good question. Unfortunately, I do not believe that there is any API access to
    the full path of the linked file:

    This can almost certainly not be used to cut a room and its boundaries, because
    that is not represented as a solid at all.

    Well, there is of course a fundamental difference between the path and the selected
    filename in that the path is a pretty constant application-wide setting, whereas
    the selected filename is an ephemeral user selected choice of the moment.


    I don''t know off-hand. Some things you can try are to enumerate all the files
    in the current template path, and check the category of the current family document.
    That might at least help you limit down things. You could probably use Windows
    tools like FileMon or Process Monitor to determine which template file was read
    last by Revit, or the underlying Windows APIs to monitor the file access:


    <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896642">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896642</a>


    <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896645">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896645</a>


    What is the context within which you need this information, and what do you need
    it for?


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    Why?


    What for?


    What does that mean?


    In what way is you mapping based on the selected template, and why does that have
    to be so?


    I don''t understand your objective at all, so there is nothing I can suggest.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'
