  body: Nice! Guidize looks very helpful. I've been using <a href="http://www.guidgenerator.com/">http://www.guidgenerator.com/</a>
    to generate GUIDs for me, but will definitely take a look at your tool to save
    me copying and pasting.

  body: "Dear Rod,\n\nThank you for your appreciation and the useful link! \n\nIt\
    \ sure saves time if you have many commands to assign ids to, and it was fun to\
    \ make some minimal use of the .NET XML handling classes to dash off this little\
    \ command line tool.\n\nCheers, Jeremy."

  body: 'Dear Jeremy, I''ve tried to write several names for the FullClassName tag
    in my first Revit Program (Hello World) and I''ve followed the directions literally
    in the API Developer Guide and then an error message appeared when I executed
    the program. I still have trouble understanding the Full Class Name concept. Could
    you explain me more about the Full Class Name, please?


    Thank you so much!

    Regards

    Hector Diaz'

  body: 'I was going through revamping my installer to utilize Addin files instead
    of modifying the Revit.ini and realized this new method would mean that my Addin
    is automatically loaded for all Revit types, Arch/Struct/MEP, which is not ideal
    for multiple reasons.  Is there a way to control this, perhaps I am overlooking
    something simple here.


    Also I note that the Developer guide tells me to use a AddInId tag but everything
    I have seen indicates a ClientID?'

  body: "Dear Shayne,\n\nThat sounds like a good idea to me, since, as said, the Revit.ini\
    \ add-in registration is going away.\n\nThank you for your very valid questions.\
    \ \n\nFirst, the simple one: the two tags AddInId and ClientID are perfectly equivalent\
    \ and can be used interchangeably. They were created to confuse you, and for no\
    \ other reason.\n\nSecondly, you can use the VisibilityMode tag to control loading\
    \ of external commands into the different flavours of Revit:\n\n<a href=\"http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2010/05/addin-visibility-mode.html\"\
    >http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2010/05/addin-visibility-mode.html</a>\n\
    \nThird, the VisibilityMode tag does not affect external applications. Those,\
    \ however, can control the Revit flavour in their OnStarup method and refuse to\
    \ loa in the inappropriate flavours:\n\n<a href=\"http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2010/06/addin-applications-for-multiple-revit-products.html\"\

    \nI hope this answers all your needs.\n\nCheers, Jeremy.\n-----"
