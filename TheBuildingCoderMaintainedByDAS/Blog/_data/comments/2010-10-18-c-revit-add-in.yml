    \ manifest file is located in the wrong place on the hard disk and not picked\
    \ up by Revit.\n\n- the path of the add-in assembly or the fully qualified external\
    \ command class name is erroneously specified in the add-in manifest.\n\nQuestions:\
    \ \n\nDo you get any error message from Revit? If not, it is probably not reading\
    \ the add-in manifest file at all.\n\nDoes the external command button for your\
    \ command appear in the Revit UI?\n\nI hope this helps resolve the problem.\n\n\
    Cheers, Jeremy."

  body: 'Dear Cobroni,


    The messages you describe have nothing to do with your add-in, and the fact that
    the button is displayed shows that the manifest file was found and loaded successfully.
    So you must have a typo in the path or the class name, or some other error.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    Your example is on managed code. Could you give an example on native code as well.'

  body: 'Dear Cobroni,


    To put it simply and bluntly: No.


    The Revit API is a .NET API, and nothing but that.


    It took you a while to figure that one out, huh?


    To quote the developer guide:


    1.6 Supported Programming Languages


    The Revit Platform API is fully accessible by any language compatible with the
    Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5, such as Visual Basic .NET or Visual C#.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    am migrating my project on native code from Revit 2009 to 2011.

    Actually the same .NET languages are listed in Revit 2009 Developer Guide. Though
    i do build revit connection dll on native code because revitapi.tlb was available.'

    Here is the equivalent quote from the Revit 2009 developer guide "Revit 2009 API
    Developer Guide.pdf", published in September 2008:


    1.6 Supported Programming Languages


    The Revit Platform API is fully accessible by any language compatible with the
    Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0, such as Visual Basic .NET or Visual C#.


    So you will have to go even further back before you encounter "native language"
    support. In fact, there never was any; it was simply a raw COM API before the
    .NET support was introduced.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: 'Dear handy,


    Sorry, but I cannot read the error messages and I have no clue what might be going
    on anyway.


    The first thing to do is to simply step through the walk-throughs described in
    chapter 2 of the Revit SDK developer guide "Revit 2012 API Developer Guide.pdf".


    Once you have completed those successfully, you can start trying to work with
    C++ and fixing the problem you describe.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    Thank you for the great tutorials.


    I am using Microsoft Visual Studio Express 2012 in Windows 8 for writing a add-in
    for AutoDesk revit 2013. I still stuck in "adding reference and framework".


    1. With C++ I cannot see any template called class library.


    2. With C# it said something like "The project targets .NETCore while the reference
    targets .NETframework" and I cannot add the reference.


    I really hope that you can answer my enquiries.

    Thank!'
