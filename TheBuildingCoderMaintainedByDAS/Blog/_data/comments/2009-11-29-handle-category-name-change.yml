    additionally, not only category but also parameter names may change between the
    years, perhaps you could add the image I''ve sent you some days ago.


    Of course we could use BuiltInParameter enum, which is definitely the better way
    because of language-independed access.



    Best regards,

    Rudolf'

  body: 'Dear Rudolf,


    Thank you for the reminder and suggestion.


    I cannot update old posts, simply due to time contraints. I prefer adding new
    ones instead.


    Everything is always in flux, and it is impossible to keep all old posts up to
    date forever.


    Best regards from the 62nd floor overlooking the desert of Las Vegas!


    Cheers, Jeremy.
