    \ The slow behaviour reported has to do with the internal workflow in the API\
    \ and is not specific to the family file after all, except for the fact that if\
    \ it is a heavy dataset, the slowdown while setting a considerable number of parameters\
    \ is more noticeable. \n\nApparently, the present workflow internally recalculates\
    \ and regenerates other parameters every time a new parameter is set or the value\
    \ of an existing parameters is altered. This is done in order to check the impact\
    \ of any change of certain parameter values on others. This is causing the delay.\
    \ \n\nAn SPR has been logged with the Revit engineering team and they are looking\
    \ into this internal workflow. Unfortunately, there does not seem to be any workaround\
    \ at the moment (I had tried using SuspendUpdating initially, but it had no impact)."

  body: 'Hi Jeremy,


    I wonder if you have any recommendation for profiling Revit 2010.


    I have tried using two separate .NET profilers (ANTS and dotTRACE) and they both
    do not recognized Revit.exe 2010 as a .NET executable.  I have had no problem
    profiling my addin in Revit 2009.  Apparently some change was made in Revit 2010
    that the main executable is no longer .NET based?'

  body: 'Dear Ben,


    Thank you for the question and sorry that I have no answer for you at the moment.
    I saw your ADN case and chipped in there as well, in the background. We are checking
    with the development team, but currently I am not aware of any profiler that works
    with the Revit 2010 API.


    Technically, Revit.exe is not a .NET application and never has been. It is a native
    MFC .exe which invokes some .NET components, including the API, during the course
    of its run.  Unfortunately, we have heard that managed code profilers will not
    work with Revit 2010 due to some internal implementation requirements.


    Cheers, Jeremy.
