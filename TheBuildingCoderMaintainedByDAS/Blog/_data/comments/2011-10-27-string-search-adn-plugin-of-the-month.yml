  body: 'Hi Jeremy,


    That''s a great plugin, thanks for sharing.


    Without wanting to sound ungrateful, I wanted to give feedback on a few things
    I tried which didn''t quite work out:


    1) I recently wanted to search for all lighting fixture tags showing a particular
    value.  This add-in doesn''t do it because the value isn''t in a parameter of
    the lighting fixture tag.  Is it even possible to modify the code to do this,
    i.e. find lighting fixture tags based on the values of parameters in the lighting
    fixtures they''re related to?


    2) The add-in doesn''t appear to search all parameters, e.g. I searched for the
    offset value of lighting fixtures but it couldn''t find them.


    3) It would be great to be able to make a selection set of the entire results
    list.'

    How can I use API to load the Keyboard Shortcut file(*.xml) or is there some methods
    to load this file automaticly?Could you give me some ideas?

    Thanks very much!

  body: 'Dear C M,


    Thank you very much for your appreciation and feedback.


    1. The way the tool is currently designed, there is no way to search for objects
    of a specific type in a specific relationship to objects of another type which
    have certain values. I cannot really imagine how you would design a generic user
    interface for such a specification. It would be easily solvable by writing your
    own add-in, though, which is what I would suggest doing for such a case.


    2. True, it currently only searches for string values. I had originally implemented
    searching for all value data types, but my initial testers complained that the
    whole thing was too generic and hard to understand, so I simplified it by limiting
    the searches to strings. You could easily add floating point number support as
    well, though, and the stubs for that are all there in the code.


    3. That is a great suggestion and easily doable. Since you have the code, you
    can implement it yourself as well. I''ll put it on my todo list, though, in addition.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    1) It''s good to know this kind of relationship can be accessed.


    2) I hadn''t appreciated it was string only.


    3) Cool!'
