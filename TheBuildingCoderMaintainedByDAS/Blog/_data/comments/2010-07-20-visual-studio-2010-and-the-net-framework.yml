    Does this post meant that selecting 3.5 instead of the default 4.0 clears most
    issues regarding VS2010, or have other issues come up? Warm regards from Los Angeles,

    Nope, not from me, yet, anyway; I am still using Visual Studio 2008 myself, the
    officially supported version.


    I will probably install 2010 in the very next week or two, though ... maybe then  :-)


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: "Hi Jeremy\n\nI am getting the following error message every time I open Revit\

    \ “Class1” because an application already exists with this AddInId node. \nThe\
    \ AddInId node is a Globally Unique Identifier (GUID) used to identify the add-in\

  body: 'Dear Morgan,


    It is impossible for you to receive this message if you really remove all add-ins
    and shut down and restart Revit again.


    I therefore assume that you did not succeed in removing them all.


    Regardless of that, this message is telling you that some add-in id was duplicated.
    That is the GUID listed in the AddInId tag in the example above. The tag may also
    be named ClientId instead of AddInId.


    There are lots of ways to fix this, but they all require you to find the offending
    add-in manifest first.


    Depending on your operating system it should be in one of the following locations:


    For a specific user:


    For Windows XP - C:\Documents and Settings\\Application Data\Autodesk\Revit\Addins\2012


    For Vista/Windows 7 - C:\Users\\AppData\Roaming\Autodesk\Revit\Addins\2012


    For all users:


    For Windows XP - C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\Autodesk\Revit\Addins\2012


    For Vista/Windows 7 - C:\ProgramData\Autodesk\Revit\Addins\2012.


    Look at the following post for more details and an explanation on how to generate
    a new unique id:

    close everything. As you can see, it''s not an add-in! If this can be done, do
    you have any example code?


    Thanks very much,

    Not directly. This can easily be achieved using a journal file, though. Please
