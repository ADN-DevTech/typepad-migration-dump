  body: 'Dear Sandeep,


    How can you reproduce that? I opened a model with a couple of sheets and views,
    selected Add-Ins > RvtSamples > Data Exchange >  Import and Export > Export IMAGE
    > OK, tried various options in the following dialogue, and was unable to detect
    any problems.


    Cheers, Jeremy.
