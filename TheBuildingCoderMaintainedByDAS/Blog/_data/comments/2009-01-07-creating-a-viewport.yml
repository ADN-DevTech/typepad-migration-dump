  body: Can Schedules also be added this way? As I can add any view I want on a sheet,
    but when trying to place schedule - I get some interesting results - I see a lot
    of strange lines on my sheet (actually not really on a sheet, but arround it)
    and as I look at the elements, currently placed on sheet - I see only title block
    and revision schedule - so no elements where really placed on a sheet.

  body: "Dear Hassan,\n\nThere is currently no official API access to the schedules,\
    \ so the short answer is no, unfortunately. \n\nWe had some discussions in the\
    \ past on accessing existing schedule data, e.g. in comments on the post on locked\
    \ dimensioning:\n\n<a href=\"http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2009/02/locked-dimensioning.html\"\
    >http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2009/02/locked-dimensioning.html</a>\n\
    \nIt seems that some developers resorted to using AutoHotKey for this:\n\n<a href=\"\

    \nCheers, Jeremy."

  body: Thanks Jeremy. One more thing - when placing legend view on a sheet, a get
    it positioned slightly to the southeast of the specified center point, although
    all other types of views that I've tried are positioned correctly. Maybe it's
    some kind of a known behavior, that I am not aware of?

    Sorry, I am not aware of this ... maybe somebody else knows about this and can
    chip in?


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    Can we use Revit 2013 API to control the location of viewport title?'

  body: 'Dear Clare,


    I would suggest using RevitLookup to explore this issue for yourself. If the viewport
    title has a valid location property, then it can probably be modified as you like.
    If not, there may be other properties that you can use.


    Cheers, Jeremy.
