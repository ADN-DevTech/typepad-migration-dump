  body: Can't make it work on Revit Arch 2012... I've dowloaded 2012 SDK and when
    I try to load the PimpMyRevit.dll file it tells me that "UIApp implements IExternalCommand
    but doesn't contain both RegenerationAttribute and TransactionAttribute!". Does
    current DLL file need extra coding to make it work on 2012? Thanks for your help!

  body: "Dear Edgardo,\n\nYes, the posted version is for Revit 2011. Yes, you probably\
    \ need to do something to run it in Revit 2012. \n\nI will definitely not support\
    \ anybody in doing so, because this if for professional programmers only, who\
    \ know what they are doing.\n\nIf you run into a problem with this that you have\
    \ difficulty solving on your own, I strongly suggest you leave this project alone.\n\
    \nCheers, Jeremy."

  body: "Dear Jeremy Tammik,\n\nYour article about tuning UI of AutoCAD or Revit is\
    \ very interesting.\nI would like to create custom color schemes for AutoCAd which\
    \ could be selected and activated from Options menu Display tab Window Elements\
    \ Color scheme. By default - as you know - there are two option for this setting:\
    \ 'light' or 'dark' one.\nI would like to get control over all of the colors of\
    \ AutoCAD graphic user interface and make new color schemes with new names which\
    \ could be selected from the above mentioned menu. \nI hope you can add some tips\
    \ to do that.\nPlz give me some hints"
