    I think there are file formats which can handle with *instances* of geometric
    objects.


    If there are FamilyInstances which have the same geometry but different transformations,
    they could be handled in a different way than e.g. walls. You could collect one
    untransformed geometry plus all the location points and rotations.


    Think of a thousand windows of the same type.

    Why storing all vertices if you could get them by calculation ?

    I think this is the way how Revit does it itself.


    I don''t know the *.obj format, but perhaps it may be possible.



    Bye,

    Rudi'

    Yes, that is obviously much more intelligent.


    No, the OBJ format does not support this.


    Cheers, Jeremy.
