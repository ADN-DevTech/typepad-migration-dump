  body: 'Hi Jeremy,


    I''m sorry that I have to bother you with a different topic here.


    Last week, on the Autodesk''s Revit Clinic blog site, there was an announcement
    about the availability of a late Revit 2013 Hotfix for Server and Part Family.


    Although the name says Revit 2013 Hotfix, the Readme file specifies that the affected
    products are Revit 2013 Architecture, Revit 2013 MEP, Revit 2013 Structure and
    Autodesk® Revit® Server 2013.


    This is a little bit misleading and I am not sure that this Hotfix applies also
    or not to Revit 2013 One Box product.


    In the same time, the comments section to this entry are closed (which I find
    a little disrespectful), therefore being impossible to ask for some enlightenment
    on this topic.


    Do you have any idea about this issue or could you raise the awareness off your
    colleagues about opening the comments section so that people can ask for help
    and explanations?


    Thanks in advantage for your kindness and time.


    Regards,


    Constantin'
