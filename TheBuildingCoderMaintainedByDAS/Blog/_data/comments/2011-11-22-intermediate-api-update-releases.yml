  body: "Jeremy,\n\nI have the following code for a Revit add-in I am working on (for\
    \ 2011 and 2012):\n\nElementId ep = new ElementId(BuiltInParameter.VIEWPORT_DETAIL_NUMBER);\n\
    \                \nUpdaterRegistry.AddTrigger(updater.GetUpdaterId(), filter,\
    \ Element.GetChangeTypeParameter(ep));\n\nIt seems to work just fine compiling\
    \ with the 2011 API.  The only difference I can see between the code example you\
    \ have is the \"updater.GetUpdaterId()\" vs. \"GetUpdaterId()\" in your code.\
    \  \n\nI am just a novice of sorts, so I don't know if that really made the difference\
    \ or if it was just a more updated version of the 2011 API?\n\nHope that helps.\
    \  It was just fresh in my mind and I wanted to contribute my 2 cents.\n\n\nNick"

  body: Sorry, I didn't read far enough into your post (for the answer).. whoops!  I
    appreciate the link to the version check (so I can make sure everyone is using
    the updated version of 2011 for my add-in).

  body: 'Jeremy -

    Your code registers an Updater to respond to a change in a built-in parameter,
    whose ElementId is independent of the Document in which it exists. Since an Updater
    is not associated with a particular Document when it is registered, and does not
    know the Document until its Execute method is invoked, is there any way to get
    an Updater to respond to a change in a custom parameter? GetChangeTypeAny() does
    not appear to work with text parameters (per the documentation). Is it possible
    to add a ChangeType to the Updater when a Document opens (ie. after the Updater
    is already registered)?
