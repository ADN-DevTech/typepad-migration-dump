  body: 'Dear Arif,


    I don''t know off-hand.


    What are the exact steps to create it manually, e.g. in an empty new project?


    What new elements are added? You can explore them using the element lister, RevitLookup,
    and the Revit Python and Ruby shells.


    Then you have three options to try to achieve the same programmatically: best:
    use the proper API call; second best: use PostCommand, which provides very limited
    programmatic control and may require user interaction; hardest: simulate the user
    interaction.


    Correction: of course it is possible, man!


    Look here:

    You should have started by looking in the help file for ''filled'' and ''region'',
    then you would have found it.


    So should I  :-)


    I hope this helps.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'
