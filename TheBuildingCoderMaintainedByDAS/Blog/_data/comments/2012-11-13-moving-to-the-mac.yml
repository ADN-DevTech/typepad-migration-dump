  body: Hey, gear up for some opinion. I use bootcamp and like it much more than parallels.
    Bootcamp is native, parallels is more like a half baked wrapper.

  body: 'Dear KR,


    I love opinion, the more the better, especially well founded like yours  :-)


    Aha, very interesting. I fiddled a bit more with parallels now and got it to work
    well for me, except the synchronisation is messed up somehow.


    As far as I understand it, bootcamp provides dual boot, but not side by side working
    on the two systems. Is that correct?


    The working style I am currently developing is to do all I can (almost everything)
    on the Mac, and switch to parallels only for the things that cannot be achieved
    there currently running Revit and Visual Studio).


    I guess your use case is different, since you do real work?  :-)


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: 'Hey Jeremy,


    Thanks for the complement. Yes, bootcamp provides dual boot, but you cannot use
    it side by side like parallels. I prefer this as it gives me the native windows
    feel and rebooting is not majorly an issue as most of my work is around Autodesk
    products and I have to somehow stay within the windows environment for the most
    part.

    I made you a compliment. Happy you liked it. Happy it was a complement to something
    as well for you  :-)

    Yeah, we have different use cases, then.


    I would love more mac tips. And I find all I need on the internet. A lot of what
    I am doing is on the command line and using shell scripts.

  body: 'Hi Jeremy,


    I can''t believe that nobody asked about the elephant in the room yet. The elephant
    of course being Revit for Mac OS X. Naturally, even if it was going to happen,
    you wouldn''t be able to tell us about it right now. However, if you were to advise
    on the most future-proof language for Revit development, would you say we should
    stick to .Net or start exploring other possibilities, like Python maybe?


    Cheers,

    I just started experimenting with coding add-ins for Revit and as a novice programmer
    this insight is going to be massively influential for me.

    I know nothing of any such plans. Right now, the Python add-in for Revit is also
    based on .NET via IronPython. Hmm, no idea, really. Interesting question. Maybe
    you can hunt down some Revit development insiders at AU and ask them in private.
    I hope I will remember to do so.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    I certainly wish I was going to AU to hunt down all sorts of more and less official
    Revit info. Unfortunately, I''ll have to follow it remotely and hope for others
    to share their findings. :-)

    Well I''ll certainly keep you in mind when I''m there and do all I can to share
