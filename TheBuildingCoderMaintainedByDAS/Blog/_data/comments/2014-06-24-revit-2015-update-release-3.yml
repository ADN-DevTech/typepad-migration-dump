  body: 'Dear John,


    Thank you for your query.


    I have also just grabbed your associated ADN case 09691948 [Unable to change a
    duct''s System Type in an Add-in].


    I am very sorry that the initial reply provided by my colleagues was completely
    beside the point and that nothing has happened since then.


    They are all very busy right now, all with exciting stuff, and so am I  :-)


    Still, I''ll take a look at this as soon as I can.


    Thank you for your patience!


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    The quickest answer I can provide to your query is this:


    Look at the AdnRme HVAC sample:


    <a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2012/05/the-adn-mep-sample-adnrme-for-revit-mep-2013.html">http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2012/05/the-adn-mep-sample-adnrme-for-revit-mep-2013.html</a>


    Search the source code for some permutation of ''air'' and ''supply''.


    The most up-to-date version that I have provided of it is for Revit 2014:


    <a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2013/06/the-adn-sample-adnrme-for-revit-mep-2014.html">http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2013/06/the-adn-sample-adnrme-for-revit-mep-2014.html</a>


    I am working on a version for Revit 2015 for you at this very moment.


    Thank you for your patience!


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    I created a GitHub repository for the AdnRme sample to share it with you more
    easily:


    <a href="https://github.com/jeremytammik/AdnRme">https://github.com/jeremytammik/AdnRme</a>


    I then migrated it to Revit MEP 2015 for you:


    <a href="https://github.com/jeremytammik/AdnRme/releases/tag/2015.0.0.0">https://github.com/jeremytammik/AdnRme/releases/tag/2015.0.0.0</a>


    Have you found the solution to your query in there yet?


    Please let us know how it works out for you.


    Thank you.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: "Dear John,\n\nI now searched for the answer to your question in the AdnRme\
    \ sample.\n\nI initially implemented what you need using standard generic Revit\
    \ element parameter functionality.\n\nHowever, there is a newer and simpler way\
    \ to do is using MEP specific API functionality as well.\n\nWisely, I stored that\
    \ answer in the code:\n\n\"You should be able to just use RBS_SYSTEM_CLASSIFICATION_PARAM\
    \ instead of RBS_SYSTEM_TYPE_PARAM if you like. \n\nThe former System Type property\
    \ on duct and piping systems (RBS_SYSTEM_TYPE_PARAM) has been renamed to System\
    \ Classification (RBS_SYSTEM_CLASSIFICATION_PARAM). We are renaming it for clarify\
    \ and to avoid confusion with the new duct and piping system type elements. This\
    \ naming also goes in line with other similar parameters like Load Classification.\n\
    \nThe former System Type property on duct and pipe connectors to has been renamed\
    \ to System Classification. The associated parameters RBS_DUCT_SYSTEM_TYPE and\
    \ RBS_PIPE_SYSTEM_TYPE has been renamed to RBS_DUCT_CONNECTOR_SYSTEM_CLASSIFICATION_PARAM\
    \ and RBS_PIPE_CONNECTOR_SYSTEM_CLASSIFICATION_PARAM.\n\nAnother more 'correct'\
    \ way to do this would be to get the Autodesk::Revit::DB::ElementType::MEPSystemType\
    \ using the *new* RBS_DUCT_SYSTEM_TYPE_PARAM param from the family instance as\
    \ above. You should then be able to check the system classification enum (Autodesk::Revit::DB::MEPSystemClassification)\
    \ in the duct system type element to identify what kind of air system it is (Supply,\
    \ Return, Exhaust etc). This would also work for piping system components using\
    \ the RBS_PIPING_SYSTEM_TYPE_PARAM param.\"\n\nPlease let us know how you make\
    \ use of this.\n\nActually, please add it to the AdnRme sample yourself and let\
    \ me know so I can integrate it into the master branch.\n\nThank you!\n\nI hope\
    \ this helps.\n\nCheers, Jeremy."

    Can you clarify please what does mean ''Improves retention of parameters in line
    boundary condition objects.'' in the Revit API enhancements list?


    Thanks,

  body: 'Dear Victor,


    I believe there was an issue with the parameters passed in to the boundary condition
    constructor. Their values were lost, so you had to set their values (again) using
    parameters after calling the constructor. Now the values passed in to the constructor
    are retained, as they should be. I think.


    Cheers, Jeremy.
