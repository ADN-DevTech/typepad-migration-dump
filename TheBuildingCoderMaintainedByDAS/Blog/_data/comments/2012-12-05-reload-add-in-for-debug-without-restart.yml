  body: 'Hi Jeremy,


    Actully per my experience, it''s a good debug practics but not stable. I used
    to encounter Revit freeze or even crash after 4 or 5 times of debugging in this
    way. But Anyway, it''s the most convenient debug approach as far as I know :)


    BTW, did you ever attend AU in China? AU (China) 2012 will be held in Shanghai
    on Dec. 13 and 14. I''ll be there and do a speech about Industrial Building solution
    based on Revit, into which I copied many codes from the Building Coder :) I met
    your colleague Joe Ye last year.


    Best Regards,

    David Tan'

    FYI, I find that with a WPF add-in application I have problems (e.g. crashes,
    object reference not set) when the add-in is run for the second time.  I logged
    this as SPR # 211649  a couple of months ago.


    Best regards

    second time+).

  body: 'Dear David,


    Oh dear, sorry to hear about the instability, and glad to hear that you find it
    efficient as well. If you can create a reproducible problem, please let us know
    so we can try to fix it.


    No, I never attended AU in China; I would love to go some day. Congratulations
    on your presentation there, and I am glad to hear that you found some useful stuff
    for it in The Building Coder.


    Best regards to Joe if you see him; we work together closely and unfortunately
    seldom meet.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: 'Dear Victor,


    Thank you very much for reporting this, and especially for the journal file. That
    is helpful and important for the development team to find out what is going on.
    I submitted SPR #232820 [AddInManager instability] for them to take a look at
    this.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: 'Dear Simon,


    Thank you very much for reporting this in the first place, and for bringing it
    up again. Sorry that nothing much happened after your initial report. The issue
    does not seem to be related to WPF per se. I submitted SPR #232820 [AddInManager
    instability] for the development team to take a look at this.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: 'Dear David,


    Thank you. Details will be appreciated. As I mentioned below, I submitted a report
    for this instability, and if you could provide a journal file describing the problem
    like Victor did, that might be useful to add to it for further exploration.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: 'Here is a comment that Bettina Zimmermann asked me to add:


    I was forced to re-compile and re-test my add-in repeatedly during my exploration
    to find the right parameter to change the viewport type:


    <a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2013/01/changing-viewport-type.html">http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2013/01/changing-viewport-type.html</a>


    It was really nice with the add-in manager in Revit, since it saved me from having
    to restart Revit between each code change and compile.


    The add-in manager is close to making up for the loss of the Visual Studio "edit
    and continue" functionality on Windows 32 bit. "Edit and continue" made it possible
    to write a lot of code without restarting the program, which is especially useful
    when implementing an add-in. Working on Inventor, AutoCAD or Revit add-ins often
    require a long boring wait each time they need a restart to test the change.
