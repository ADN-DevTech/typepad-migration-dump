  body: 'Hello jeremy, i like your blog, its really apreciated that you update it
    so often. I´m starting to learn Revit API, intending in the future to use it on
    a "cheap housing design" proyect that im developing. I also have a BIM blog (a
    pretty basic one)<a href="http://bimchile.wordpress.com/">http://bimchile.wordpress.com/</a>

    i wanted to ask you, do you think there´s online work oportunities (im live in
    Chile, latin america)for someone that use revit API?  Maybe on software developing
    companies on europe or USA?. Thanks in advance, and keep on the good work.'

    Thank you, glad you like the blog. I would suggest contacting your local Autodesk
    office and asking them what they think and whom they can point you to. Good luck!


    Cheers, Jeremy.'
