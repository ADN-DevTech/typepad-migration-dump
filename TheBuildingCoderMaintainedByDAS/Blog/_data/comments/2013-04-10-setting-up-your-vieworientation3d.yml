  body: "Hi Jeramy,\n\nI know this is a comment on quite an old post, but I'm kinda\
    \ stuck in creating (I must say one of my first) addins. \n\nI'm recently trying\
    \ to study the View3D / setOrientation classes and objects. According to your\
    \ post on the \"whats new on\" revit 2013 api the setOrientation object can be\
    \ used to set or GET the object value of a view. (<a href=\"http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2013/03/whats-new-in-the-revit-2013-api.html)\"\
    >http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2013/03/whats-new-in-the-revit-2013-api.html)</a>\n\
    \nNow setting the viewOrientation3D is quite straightforward, but since I need\
    \ to copy the orientation of an existing view to the next to create stacked floorplates\
    \ in isometric views. I need to first READ the ViewOrientation3D properties before\
    \ being able to set it in the next. \n\nDo you know how can this be done? How\
    \ can one GET the activeview ViewOrientation3D properties using the setOrientation\
    \ object in an active isometric view...\n\nMany thanks"

    How about View3D.GetOrientation?


    Here is another related article, by the way:

    Remove the "new", unless you are creating a new instance of a type.'
