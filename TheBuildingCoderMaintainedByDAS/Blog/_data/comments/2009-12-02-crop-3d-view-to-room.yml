    I  added shared parameter to the revit elements in the host file. I also want
    to add a shared parameter to the linked file elements. I mean to say the shared
    parameter should be added to the elements of the host file as well as likned file
    while executing my command.Is this possible ?'

    Is it possible here to use section box instead of Crop Box?

    If yes the that''s very good.'

    As far as I know, there is no ready-made control that can do this for you. You
    can create your own, of course, by querying the Revit elements for their geometry
    and rendering it to a window using OpenGL or any other technology you like.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: 'Dear Nitin,


    In the Revit 2012 API, the new property UIDocument.ActiveView has both a getter
    and setter, so it allows you to query the currently active view of the currently
    active document, and also to set it similarly to what an end user can do by changing
    a view in the Project Browser in Revit.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: Hello Mr. Jeremy,  I'm working on a project that needs to calculate the Footprint
    area of a building in Revit. I believe the above example is related to my question
    because It also needs to projects all vertex to the ground plan. But how to identify
    the boundary and calculate the boundary area is beyond my knowledge. Could you
    please help me with the instruction how to achieve that.   Thank you very much
    in advance :)

  body: 'Dear Thanh Chương Nguyễn,


    The answer depends on your needs and your model.


    Maybe you can just grab the outline of the base level floors, or project the roof
    boundary onto the XY plane.


    Maybe you can create a union of all building elements and use the extrusion analyser
    to project those onto the XY plane.


    Maybe you can project all building elements that you are interested in onto the
    XY plane, and then create a union of all the 2D polygons, e.g. using the 2D Boolean
    operations:


    <a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2013/09/boolean-operations-for-2d-polygons.html">http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2013/09/boolean-operations-for-2d-polygons.html</a>


    The options are innumerable.


    I hope this helps.


    Cheers, Jeremy.
