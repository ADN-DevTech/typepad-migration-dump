  body: When constructing a slab, how can I specify openings?  Obviously just appending
    them to the passed CurveArray doesn't produce the desired effect and I can't figure
    out how to add them after-the-fact.  Any thoughts?

  body: "Dear Mike,\n\nSorry for the belated answer, I just returned from a vacation.\
    \ \n\nActually, I believe there are two ways of creating openings. \n\nOne possibility\
    \ is to use the Document.NewOpening method to create openings in an existing host\
    \ element. \n\nThe second may indeed be to append additional loops to the passed-in\
    \ curve array directly when creating the host object, as you can see from the\
    \ comment by Ning on creating walls with openings, even though he points out that\
    \ it is not always working reliably in his case:\n\n<a href=\"http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2009/02/creating-a-wall-with-a-sloped-profile.html?cid=6a00e553e1689788330120a6cd4ccf970b#comment-6a00e553e1689788330120a6cd4ccf970b\"\

    \nI presented some code to generate a slab in \n\n<a href=\"http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2008/11/editing-a-floor-profile.html\"\

    \nThe additional edge loops in the existing slab are intentionally eliminated\
    \ in that code. You might be able to modify it to leave them in and thus create\
    \ the required openings at the same time as the slab itself. I should add that\
    \ I did attempt to do this myself and was unable to get it to work as expected.\
    \ Although Ning seems to have used it to create walls with openings, it may not\
    \ work for floors.\n\nCheers, Jeremy.\n-----"
