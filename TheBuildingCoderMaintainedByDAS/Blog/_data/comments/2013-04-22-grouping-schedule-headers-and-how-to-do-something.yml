  body: 'Hi Jeremy,


    Thanks for your article about schedules.


    I have a question that is not directly linked to what you explained but linked
    with the creation of schedules.


    I would like to add the wall "base constraint" and "unconnected height" parameters
    in my automatic wall schedule but it seems impossible.


    I used the built-in parameters WALL_BASE_CONSTRAINT and WALL_USER_HEIGHT_PARAM
    but it failed :


    ScheduleField level = schedule.Definition.AddField(ScheduleFieldType.Instance,
    new ElementId(BuiltInParameter.WALL_BASE_CONSTRAINT));


    ScheduleField height = schedule.Definition.AddField(ScheduleFieldType.Instance,
    new ElementId(BuiltInParameter.WALL_USER_HEIGHT_PARAM));


    I know these parameters are not schedulable for Revit users but I thought I could
    simply add them with some code since they are built-in parameters.


    But... I checked and they are not in the list that we get with the GetAvailableParameters()
    method for OST_Walls.


    What do you think about that ? Do I have to create a shared parameter, copy the
    BIP value in it, then schedule it ? Are there any other workarounds ?


    Thanks in advance for your help.


    Cheers.


    Maxime'

    Thank you for your appreciation and interesting question.


    I am not sure off-hand.


    Can you achieve that in the user interface?


    If so, it should certainly be doable programmatically as well.


    Could you please submit an ADN query with a reproducible case for us to explore?


    Thank you!


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    Oh dear. If it is not possible in the user interface, then there is not much we
    can do API-wise either.


    Yes, please submit an ADN issue with a reproducible test case and an explanation
    of why you need this, including:


    <ul>

    <li>A complete yet minimal Revit sample model.</li>

    <li>Detailed step-by-step instructions for reproducing the issue.</li>

    <li>Specification of the exact behaviour you observe versus what you expect.</li>

    </ul>


    Best would be if you explain why you need it as a standard non-API product feature,
    without mentioning that you wish to drive it programmatically.


    Cheers, Jeremy.
