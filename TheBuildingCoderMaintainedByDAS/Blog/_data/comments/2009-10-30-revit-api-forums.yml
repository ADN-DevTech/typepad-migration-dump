  body: 'Hi Jeremy,


    I was hoping you can help me with an issue I am having with the Revit API. I wrote
    a printing application for Revit that my company uses for billing purposes. One
    of the requirements of the application was to allow users to print to devices
    that are not connected to their computer when Revit starts. I am able to do that
    using the SelectNewPrintDriver() method in the PrintManager and give it as a parameter
    the network location of the desired device ("\\server\queue"). My issue is that
    this method takes forever the first time I connect to a particular device, sometimes
    it takes as long as 30+ seconds for the method to complete. Can you give me any
    advice on how to speed the execution of the method?'

  body: 'Dear Ivan,


    Have you checked whether the same behaviour occurs if you select the printer through
    the user interface instead of through the API? From what you say, I suspect that
    this may be the case. If so, you could turn to product support and ask them. They
    probably have a solution which has nothing to do with the Revit API. I am pretty
    sure that there is nothing in the Revit API that you could use to improve this
    programmatically, anyway.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    You cannot access any system variables in Revit because no such thing exists.


    For the display representation of units, please refer to the Revit SDK sample
    ProjectUnit, which lists all units in the current project and displays their format
    information.

  body: 'Hi Jeremy,

    thank you very much for the present but i think i have to simplify my question.
    My question in other words is: How to create  parallel model lines to  exicting
    Modellines (or to roof''s edges).

    P.S. this have to be done only in 2D'

    That is indeed  simple question. The answer is simple as well. You can either
    calculate the model line start and end points yourself, offsetting the original
    curves endpoints perpendicularly to the line, or you can use the Revit API Curve.Transformed
    property to create a curve offset by a specific direction.

  body: 'Dear Habib,


    I do not quite see the sense or purpose of your question, but here goes anyway:


    A line is a geometric concept connecting two points. You can consider one the
    start and the other the end point.


    If you keep track of this difference, you in fact have a directed line.


    In Revit, the start and end points are distinguished by their index, which is
    0 for the start and 1 for the end point.


    I would consider the direction of a directed line to be the vector from the start
    to the end point, possibly normalised, e.g. for a Revit API Line object instance
    L:


    XYZ startPoint = L.get_EndPoint( 0 );

    XYZ endPoint = L.get_EndPoint( 1 );

    XYZ direction = (endPoint - startPoint).Normal;


    I hope this helps.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'
