  body: "Hey Jeremy, \n\nAs always good post. To extend the discussion on worksets\
    \ a bit further, it would be great if you could clarify the following two things.\
    \ Assuming that a user is working on a local copy of the central model with worksharing\
    \ enabled\n\n1) Does the filteredelementcollector collect elements that are not\
    \ editable (eg: belonging to a non-editable workset). Is there a filter we could\
    \ use to only collect those elements that are editable.\n\n2) I do not see any\
    \ properties on Element class to check if an element is editable. Sure, a workaround\
    \ could be to get the workset from the element and check if the workset is editable.\
    \ However, it does not satisfy cases where the user has borrowed individual elements.\n\
    \nThanks\n\nKR"

  body: 'Dear KR,


    1. Does the FilteredElementCollector collect elements that are not editable, e.g.
    belonging to a non-editable workset?


    Yes.


    2. Is there a filter we could use to collect those elements that are editable?


    It''s not a filter, but the WorksharingUtils.GetCheckoutStatus method returns
    this info.


    That also answers the second question.


    Cheers, Jeremy.
