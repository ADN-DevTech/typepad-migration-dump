  body: 'Hello,

    I''ve tried to use custom exporter to retrieve visible elements. On model without
    external links it works Ok, but I got nothing when there are linked models. During
    debug I never get to OnLinkBegin. Custom exporter I use for active document. The
    same document I use in context constructor. As a view I use active view (which
    is 3d view). What could be the problem?
