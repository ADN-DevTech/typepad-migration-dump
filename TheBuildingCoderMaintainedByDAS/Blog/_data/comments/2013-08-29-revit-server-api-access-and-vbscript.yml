  body: 'Hi Jeremy,


    It looks that there''s a small error concerning the hyperlink attached to the
    string "extraction process using the add-in", because it points to this very post.


    I assume that you wanted to present the mentioned add-in.


    Kind regards,


    Constantin'

    fact the link I was talking about doesn''t do anything,  because it points to
    some file on your machine.


    It''s a bit misleading, because most probably I am not the only one curious to
    find out more about that add-in.


    Sorry about the false alert,


    Constatin'
