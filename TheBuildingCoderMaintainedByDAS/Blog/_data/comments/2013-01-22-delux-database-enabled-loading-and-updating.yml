  body: "Sounds amazing.  I can think of many uses beyond the mega project you described\
    \ (and congrats for successfully tackling such a big project by the way).  We\
    \ regularly work on jobs with a lot of repetition for individual rooms, e.g. hospitals\
    \ (as you mention), prisons, schools, hotels.  \n\nWouldn't be too big a stretch\
    \ to add multiple markers to the destination file, and have a source file for\
    \ each room type, thereby maintaining the loaded room once and updating all instances\
    \ easily."

  body: 'We considered an approach like you suggest with multiple instances of rooms,
    and it is definitely viable with the same method that we describe. Keep in mind
    that the prototype room does not need to be in a seperate "prototype" file, and
    can reside in the same model file as the target rooms. Another benefit of working
    live!

    In our case we chose to concentrate on duplicating entire floor plans, but this
    choice was primarily because of project schedule. If we had developed this earlier
    in the project, then using it for typical rooms would have been a serious option.
    We used Groups for duplicating and organizing our typical rooms, which is fine
    and effective, but has a few drawbacks. The primary drawback of using Groups for
    typical rooms is that the content within a Group is not on any particular level.
    This became particularly annoying for the General Contractor when filtering the
    collaboration Navisworks model.
