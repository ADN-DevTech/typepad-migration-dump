  body: 'Creating a solution for the example should be very straightforward:

    New Solution, Type Class Library, use Framework 4 or 4.5;

    Add existing items, select all .cs files from the zip;

    Add references to RevitAPI.dll and RevitAPIUI.dll;

    Build

    Set path in .addin-file and copy to the addins-folder of Revit.


    Though the SelFilters can of course be used as a library, they are purposefully
    written in a way that they can and should just be dropped into any project that
    wants to use them.


    However, I do have created a Visual Studio 2010 project and solution for Revit
    2014:

    To use this in Revit 2015, just open it in Visual Studio 2012 or 2013, change
    the API-dlls to the 2015 Version, and the target framework setting in the project
    to .NET 4.5
