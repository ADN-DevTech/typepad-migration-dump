  body: '"""If it is important to the add-in to not "modify" the model inadvertently,
    you need to keep track of whether you have made modifications, return Succeeded
    if you did, and Cancelled or Failed if you did not."""


    You can have readonly commands that don''t modify the model and can run successfully
    or be cancelled by the user. As far as the journal is concerned a command has
    one transaction. It''s for that reason I''d argue Result.Succeeded needs to be
    split into Result.Succeeded and Result.SucceedTransact with IsModified set for
    SucceedTransact but not Succeeded. Allowing a true indication of user response
    v''s command transaction state.

  body: 'Hi Guy,


    Thank you for the clarification! I completely agree. To keep it as simple as possible
    for the default case and simultaneously maintain maximum backwards compatibility,
    Result.Succeeded could close the transaction and a new enumeration value Result.SucceededUnmodified
    could be added to indicate succcess and still abort the transaction.


    Best regards, Jeremy.'
