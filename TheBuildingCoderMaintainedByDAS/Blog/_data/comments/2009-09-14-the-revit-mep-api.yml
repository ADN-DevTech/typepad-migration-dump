    If Revit were Jesus. You would be one of his 12 deciples.


    Thank you for your hard work. Now if I could only wrap my head around this whole
    API thing. Enjoy your trip!

    Have you had a look at the following posts, which demonstrate various ways to
    use the Transform class?

  body: 'Dear Maher,


    It is a pleasure, glad you like it.


    By far the major part of the Revit API is identical for the three flavours, and
    to get started with it you need not worry about the differences. All the basic
    functionality and most objects that I have ever had occasion to use are provided
    in all three flavours.


    If you try to access a property that is not available in the particular flavour
    of Revit that your application is running in, the property will generally simply
    return a null value.


    You can check what flavour you are running in by querying the application object.


    If you really want to know the exact differences between the three flavours of
    the API, it is easy enough to find out: The class diagram in the Revit SDK provided
    in "Revit API Class Diagram.png" shows all of the namespaces and classes defined
    in the Revit API and colour codes them into various groups, including separate
    groups for the three product flavours.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    Actually, I liked your question so much I created a blog post to answer it:

    I am loading a family in revit application.I want to add that family as connector
    on a particular XYZ LOCATION.

    I am able to get those points xyz coordinate but not able to add as a connector.
    Please suggest.


    Thanks in  advance'
