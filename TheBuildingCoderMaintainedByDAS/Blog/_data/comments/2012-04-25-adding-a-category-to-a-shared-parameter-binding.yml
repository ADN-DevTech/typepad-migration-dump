    Do you know of any resources for achieving this tutorial in the Python shell?
    I havent been able to figure out the conversion of the tools for browsing the
    binding maps and retrieving data used here.


    Thanks in advance!'

    Quick question, where did BuiltInParameterGroup.PG_OTHER go?  I''m sure it was
    available before but now I can''t find it in neither of Revit Api 2013 or 2014.
    Have I missed something?


    Thanks

  body: 'Dear Glenn,


    If the binding were not correctly set up, you would not be able to retrieve the
    parameter at all, either for reading or writing, and p would always equate to
    Nothing.


    So that is not the problem.


    Is VarVal$ guaranteed to be a string?


    Reading a parameter using AsString will only return string values.

  body: "Jeremy, \n\n     Thanks for replying. Yes, VarVal$ will always be a string.\
    \  There are a few (4) shared parameters in the shared parameter file and all\
    \ of them will always return a string.  Just for the sake of thoroughness, I have\
    \ added the routine that returns the value based on the parameters storage type,\
    \ but still, I can see the parameters definition name but the value is always\
    \ Nothing.\n\nThe shared parameter is added to the project parameters as an instance\
    \ parameter related.to conduit runs, fittings, and conduits without fittings.\
    \  In this particular example, I'm dealing with a conduit run.  I know the value\
    \ is set because when I set a reference object equal to a selection of the conduit\
    \ run and evaluate the parameter's value that way, I can see the value correctly.\
    \  When using the FilteredElementCollector, the value is nothing.\n\n     I am\
    \ using a ElementCategoryFilter(OfCategory(BuiltInCategory.OST_ConduitRun)) and\
    \ applying it to the FilteredElementCollector (fec) like... fec.WherePasses(Filter).\
    \  I have filtered down further using .WhereElementIsNotElementType, and its opposite\
    \ for that matter.  I've tried looping through and reading the parameters of the\
    \ fec and through the fec.ToElements collection.  \n\nI've tried using Class Filter\
    \ TypeOf(FamilyInstance) and TypeOf(ConduitRun), still to no avail.\n\nAny help\
    \ in this is greatly appreciated, I'm at a loss.\n\nThanks in advance,\nGlen"

    Yes.


    Your filtered element collector is working on the current active document.


    You can base it on the template document instead, and loop over the conduit types
    available there.


    If it is already present in the applications Documents collection, use it from
    there, else use OpenDocument to load and read it.


    Cheers, Jeremy.
