  body: 'Dear Victor,


    How sad that you missed the webcast. At least you have the recording for that.


    Unfortunately, I do not believe that any recordings of the DevCamp session are
    planned. Sorry about that.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    \ to think about send me to the DevCamp. But on April we were moved to another\
    \ company with new director.\nI was really surprised when my boss asked me again\
    \ about the DevCamp a few days ago. As it turned out, the big boss can give money\
    \ for trainings. But, unfortunately, it was too late. It is impossible to get\
    \ Visa to the USA for the short time.\n\nHope in the next year I'll go there:)\n\
    \nP.S. By the way, I have a new interesting article for your post. I'm sure you'll\
