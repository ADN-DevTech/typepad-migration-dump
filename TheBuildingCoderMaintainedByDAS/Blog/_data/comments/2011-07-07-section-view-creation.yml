  body: 'Hi Jeremy,


    after the SectionView has been created, you can alter its ElementType.

    In your project file, you may find several different ElementTypes for Sections,
    depending on the RTE you used.


    Doing so, the new ViewSection will change from Detail View to Section View.'

  body: 'Dear Rudolf,


    Wow, do you mean to say that the note in the developer guide does not actually
    hold, in that the easy modification of the element type suggested by you changes
    the situation?


    That you can thus create a section view and then set up its type so that it really
    appears as a section view in the project browser?


    If so, we should update the developer guide to say so.


    Thank you very much for pointing this out!


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: 'Hi Jeremy,


    yes, I used that in several situations.

    The point is to find a proper ElementType that can be assigned.

    If you browse the database, you will find out that

    the ElementType for any existing Section has a "null" category, so it is only
    possible to get a valid ElementType by searching it by name, e.g. "Section" or
    (like in my German files) "Schnitt", ID 828.


    Since element names are not unique, this may fail if there are other ElementTypes
    of category "null" named this way.

    But most elementTypes have a valid category, so this is only a little risk.'

  body: 'Dear Rudolf,


    Yes, that makes sense. If you want to make really sure, you can probably determine
    some specific parameter values that only the desired section view element type
    has to further ensure uniqueness.

    If we use ourViewSection.GetVaildTypes(), we just need to search our section ElementType
    in this little list. So the amount of possible errors will be reduced to a minimum.


    Bye,

    Potential rookie question about creating a new view section.  Is it possible to
    assign a referencing view to the section?  In other words, instead of creating
    a new section view it would actually create a section tag referencing an existing
    view.


    Any help would be appreciated.  I am still a novice at this but I am learning
    as quickly as possible.'

    I managed to solve my problem by regenerating document after creation of all section
    views. After that I can place them on view sheets without any exception.


    I still don''t know what is the reason behind that sectionView.Outline exception.


    Best regards!'
