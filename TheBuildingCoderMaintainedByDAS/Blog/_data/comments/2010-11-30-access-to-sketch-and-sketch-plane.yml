    Thanks.\n\nTrang"

  body: "Dear Trang,\n\nI don't know whether there is any direct access. I just asked\
    \ some colleagues. \n\nMeanwhile, however, just creating a filled region on the\
    \ fly and using RevitLookup to analyse the results, I see that a FilledRegion\
    \ element was created with the element id 161178. Immediately before, a sketch\
    \ with id 161176 was created. Its profile defines a curve array, and the lines\
    \ are accessible. Maybe this kind of approach can help you retrieve the data you\
    \ are looking for?\n\nIf so, please let us know, and I will write up a blog post\
    \ on the topic.\n\nCheers, Jeremy."

  body: 'Dear Trang,


    Congratulations on getting it working and thank you very much for the code sample!


    I created a blog post from it and our discussion, and added a command demonstrating
    this to The Building Coder samples:


    <a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2011/09/filledregion-corrdinates.html">http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2011/09/filledregion-corrdinates.html</a>


    It is perfectly ok to post the code here, as long as it is not all too much.


    Yes, it does become a bit unreadable by loosing all leading spaces. Very unfortunate,
    but still usable. I just copy and paste it into a Visual Studio project, and it
    is all perfectly formatted again.


    Cheers, Jeremy.
