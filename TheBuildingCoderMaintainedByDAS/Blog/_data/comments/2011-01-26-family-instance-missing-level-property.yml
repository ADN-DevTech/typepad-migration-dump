  body: This doesn't seem to work if I just created the instance using any of the
    NewFamilyInstance overloads. In all cases the FAMILY_LEVEL_PARAM has "Is read-only"
    set to True.  Calling instance.get_Parameter(BuiltInParameter.FAMILY_LEVEL_PARAM).Set(doc.ActiveView.Level.Id)
    after FamilyInstance creation produces an error.  If I create the instance, then
    use the "Pick New Host" tool, I can then set the Level parameter and shows like
    normal.  Is there some other way to reproduce the "Pick New Host" tool?  Thanks.

  body: 'i''m trying to achieve the same result, with mostly the same code, but in
    my case the parameter is readonly ... wich is kinda strange since it''s a builtin
    ...

    Any advice ?'

    Sorry to hear that.


    Are you still stuck?


    There is nothing whatsoever to say that built-in parameters cannot be read-only.
    For instance, the area of a wall or a room or the length of a wall are all read-only,
    since they are determined by other, parametrically driven geometrical, means.


    Cheers, Jeremy.
