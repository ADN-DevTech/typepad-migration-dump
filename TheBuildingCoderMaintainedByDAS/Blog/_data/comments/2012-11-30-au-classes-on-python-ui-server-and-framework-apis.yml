    Is there any way I can clone a full set of elements from one document to another
    using the API? I''m trying to do this with some FilledRegion''s, TextNote''s and
    DetailLine''s but still have no success.'

    Sorry, currently no, but we are working on it  :-)


    All you can do at the moment is to create a completely new element in the target
    document and then transfer the properties one by one yourself.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'
