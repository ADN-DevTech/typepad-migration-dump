    Thank you very much, and yes, I find it hard to believe myself. I plan to go on

    There are two built-in properties: PHASE_CREATED and PHASE_DEMOLISHED. Both require
    an ElementId and supposed to be writable.

    Did you already try setting these?

  body: 'Hello Jeremy. I read your blog with a lot of interest. I am developing some
    extensions for Revit myself in Visual Basic. So far so good. The SDK and the samples,
    and your site help me a lot. Now, I am trying to develop an extension that should
    do the following. Define on base of 3 points in space a new ViewSection. I am
    struggling with the Transform. The only thing that seems to work is the BoundingBox,
    but that one is using only 2 points....Do you have any ideas?

    Thanks in advance, Renzo'

    Thank you for your interest, I am glad about that.


    You do not specify exactly how the transform you require is defined by the three
    points. Do you need a transformation of the XY plane into a plane in 3D space
    spanned by the three points?

    Yes, sorry, the selection facilities in the Revit API are currently rather limited.
