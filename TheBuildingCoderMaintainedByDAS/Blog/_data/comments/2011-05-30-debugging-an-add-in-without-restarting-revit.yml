  body: "Hi Jeremy,\n\nWhen using the Addin Manager to debug your addin it is possible\
    \ to stop the debugger without closing Revit.  You must configure the Visual Studio\
    \ debugger to \"Start project\" instead of \"Start external program\".  \n\nThis\
    \ is the workflow:\n\n1. Open a Revit Model.\n2. Open a Visual Studio project.\n\
    3. Build your Visual Studio project.\n4. Attach to the Revit.exe process (Managed\
    \ code).\n5. Run command using Addin Manager.\n6. Repeat steps 3-6 as often as\
    \ you like without ever closing Revit!\n\nJames"

    is there a way to do that with Visual Studio Express?

    (where there is no option in debugger for "start external program" or "start project")


    Cheers,'

    As far as I know, you have to manually edit the project file to enable that. I
    have no first-hand experience myself, though.


    Cheers, Jeremy.
