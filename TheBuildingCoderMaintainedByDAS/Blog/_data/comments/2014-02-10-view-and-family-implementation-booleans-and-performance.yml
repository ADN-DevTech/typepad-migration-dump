  body: "Jeremy, Great Post!\n\nTo build upon this discussion, Is it possible to hide\
    \ schedules in the project browser or is it on the radar at all.  When leveraging\
    \ the idea of fabrication detailing within a Revit project, the schedules quickly\
    \ become unmanageable. It has always seemed odd to me that you can create browser\
    \ organizations for sheets and \"views\" but ViewSchedules are left out of this\
    \ functionality. \n\nThanks!"

  body: 'Dear Matthew,


    Thank you for your appreciation. I''m glad you like it.


    I submitted a wish list item <b>CF-772</b> [wish list: hide or filter schedules
    in the project browser] for this functionality for you.


    Cheers, Jeremy.
