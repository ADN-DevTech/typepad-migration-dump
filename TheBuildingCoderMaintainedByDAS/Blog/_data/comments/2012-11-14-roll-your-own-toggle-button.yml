    long time ago, I posted a comment that relates to this topic:

    <a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2012/06/retrieve-embedded-resource-image.html">http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2012/06/retrieve-embedded-resource-image.html</a>


    "Changing an icon at runtime, would allow you to simulate a checkbox.

    One could display some global variables this way.

    The user could set them by just one click."


    I myself use the Ribbon images to display color and material settings at runtime,
    starting with Revit 2010.


    Also, using Webservices etc, icon color could change to display incoming messages...


    Best regards,

    Rudolf/Revitalizer'

  body: "Hi Jeremy,\nI'm having a bit of issue getting the image to change.  I am\
    \ using the Resources method for storing the .png in the dll.  I added this code\
    \ after the text toggle code:\n\nImageSource bImage = _button.LargeImage;\n  \
    \        _button.LargeImage = bImage.Equals(convertFromBitmap(Resources.LightsOff_32))\
    \ ? convertFromBitmap(Resources.Lights_32) : convertFromBitmap(Resources.LightsOff_32);\n\
    \nbut the image only stays as it was set in the PushButtonData.  Any tips?  Thanks."
