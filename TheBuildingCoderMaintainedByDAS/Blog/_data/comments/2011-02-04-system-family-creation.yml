    First find out how to achieve it manually in the user interface. Then explore
    the resulting model using RevitLookup. Then automate the process step by step.

  body: "I'm trying to create a command that would turn off the level heads in specific\

    Yes, sure. If the arrowhead is a normal type, it should be possible to duplicate

  body: 'Hi Jeremy,


    I actually want to create a schedule where I can get total length of a piping
    system including fittings.


    In order to do this I have created a Multi-Category Schedule, but the length field
    is not coming within this. I can add a shared parameter to calculate the length
    of fittings but the same is not possible to pipe properties.


    Kindly guide me to solve the issue.


    Thanks,

  body: 'Dear Debdutta,


    I am not an expert on schedules, but I would imagine that if all else fails, you
    can simply create a shared parameter for all pipes and populate that on each pipe
    element programmatically with the pipe length obtained from the distance between
    its start and end point.


    There are very probably other and better ways as well, though.
