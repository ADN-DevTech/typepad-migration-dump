    How do you write Rotate True North in Mandarin? Now I know, it''s on your first
    image (above).

    Mandarin is Chinese, not Japanese, I think.

    But nontheless, both of them look quite strange.

    It shows how important icons are.

  body: 'Hi, Jeremy,


    Thanks a lot for your replies.


    I have tried to play with the Revit 2012 with updates 2, and after rotating true
    north, in any external command implementation, we can find current Document.ActiveProjectLocation.GetTotalTransform()
    and the GetTransform() return the same results, both reflecting the true north
    changes. While if before applying true north changes, an external instance is
    created, then we can retrieve the instance after rotating true north, its transform
    is still Identity, which is correct and that is what we want to get.


    As for our case, we are planning to add some external Instance to the existing
    project, and can be opened explicitly after user opens some project. And the transformation
    of the instance should be correct. Then, if user creates a project, rotates true
    north, then open the external Instance files, then trouble comes, we cannot get
    the correct Instance transformation when creating it.


    Thank you so much for your kind helps and wish to hear from you about the problem:)'

  body: "Dear Frank,\n\nThere are some interesting observations on this issue in the\
    \ other comments above.\n\nDo they help at all?\n\nIn addition, you can take a\
    \ look at the  The Building Coder sample command 'Unrotate North', implemented\
    \ in the class CmdUnrotateNorth:\n\n<a href=\"https://github.com/jeremytammik/the_building_coder_samples/blob/master/BuildingCoder/BuildingCoder/CmdUnrotateNorth.cs\"\
    >https://github.com/jeremytammik/the_building_coder_samples/blob/master/BuildingCoder/BuildingCoder/CmdUnrotateNorth.cs</a>\n\
    \nWhen I select a single wall in a newly created project and run it, it displays\
    \ a dialogue box that says:\n\nSelected element location: (0.58,0.84,0)\nAngle\
    \ between project north and true north: 0 degrees\nUnrotated element location:\
    \ (0.58,0.84,0) (0.58,0.84,0) (0.58,0.84,0)\n\nAfter rotating the true north 90\
    \ degrees clockwise using Manage > Project Location > Position > Rotate Project\
    \ North, it displays the following for the same element:\n\nSelected element location:\
    \ (0.84,-0.58,0)\nAngle between project north and true north: 90 degrees\nUnrotated\
    \ element location: (0.58,0.84,0) (0.84,-0.58,0) (0.58,0.84,0)\n\nTo answer your\
    \ question in a second way by retrieving the rotation of the Project Base Point\
    \ via the BASEPOINT_ANGLETON_PARAM built-in parameter, I added the following lines\
    \ based on your sample code to the command:\n\n  Element projectInfoElement\n\
    \    = new FilteredElementCollector(doc)\n      .OfCategory(BuiltInCategory.OST_ProjectBasePoint)\n\
    \      .FirstElement();\n\n  BuiltInParameter bipAtn\n    = BuiltInParameter.BASEPOINT_ANGLETON_PARAM;\n\
    \n  Parameter patn = projectInfoElement.get_Parameter(\n    bipAtn );\n\n  double\
    \ atn = patn.AsDouble();\n\n  Debug.Print(\n    \"Angle to north from project\
    \ info: {0}\",\n    Util.AngleString( atn ) );\n\nIn the first case, it reports:\n\
    \nAngle to north from project info: 0 degrees\n\nAfter rotating 90 degrees clockwise,\
    \ it reports:\n\nAngle to north from project info: 270 degrees\n\nThat seems to\
    \ me to indicate the direction perfectly well: 90 degrees is one direction, 270\
    \ the other.\n\nI hope that makes sense.\n\nThe updated version of the command\
    \ is provided in the version 2015.0.110.3 or The Building Coder samples:\n\n<a\
    \ href=\"https://github.com/jeremytammik/the_building_coder_samples/releases/tag/2015.0.110.3\"\
