    Thank you for the sample snippet. It appears that this problem is fixed internally.
    I cannot tell how long it will take before the fix reaches you, though. I hope
    this helps. Thank you for your patience!


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    I cannot say much more about this issue right now except that the whole material
    handling and API is being reworked, so it will definitely be resolved in future
    releases.


    I hope this helps. Thank you for your patience!


    Cheers, Jeremy.
