    how are you?

    i am posting this comment again,not sure if the earlier one got posted or not,
    how do you get to view the instance parameters updated values in the "PanelEdgeLengthAngle"
    sample? i can successfully run the code, it even changes the values, but can''t
    seem to find a way to view them changed in Revit environment. Am i missing anything
    in terms of workflow?'
