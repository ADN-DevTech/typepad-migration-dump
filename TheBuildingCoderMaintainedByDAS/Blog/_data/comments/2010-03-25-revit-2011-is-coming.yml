  body: I would very much like to see early articles with any tips or tools to help
    automate, or at least simplify, the upgrade process for existing code written
    against an older verison of the API.

    sure the ribbon will work better than\nit did- but i don't hear even a mouse\n\
    squeak about that interface that half\nof us have been asking for for the \nlast\
    \ year- you know that interface \nyou get in windows 7 when you choose\nthe \"\
    best performance\" option and not \nall the eye-candy? the one that is\neasy on\

    Nope, no idea. I am not that much into user interfaces myself. I do agree with
    you, follow the Kiss principle, keep it simple, st**id.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: "Dear David,\n\nWell, all the articles ever posted are still there for you\
    \ to peruse at your leisure ... \n\nOne that deals specifically with porting from\
    \ a previous version, in that case from Revit 2009 to 2010, is \n\n<a href=\"\

    >http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2009/05/porting-the-building-coder-samples.html</a>\n\
    \nThe changes between the 2010 and 2011 API are significantly larger than in previous\
    \ releases, though.\n\nTo directly address your request, I am planning to finish\
    \ porting The Building Coder sample code and post the 2010 and 2011 versions side\
    \ by side on Monday. That will give you a sizeable code base to compare what changed\
    \ and see what I undertook to deal with the changes.\n\nCheers, Jeremy.\n-----"
