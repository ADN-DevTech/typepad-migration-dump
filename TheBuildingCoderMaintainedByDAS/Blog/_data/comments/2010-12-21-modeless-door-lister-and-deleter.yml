    \ Command class, it'll be better & safer if the Form exists within Application\
    \ class?  because the Command and its resources may be GC-ed after exectuing the\
    \ Command? I ever played with the SDK EventsMoniter, all forms resources belong\
    \ to Application... Btw, your shared sample works well currently, my comment is\
    \ just FYR."

    \ Agnius, of course!\n\nAnd even more thanks for the hint about the modeless form\
    \ resource ownership.\n\nI never thought about that before.\n\nHow exactly would\
    \ you suggest fixing this? \n\nSimply moving the variable declarations from the\
    \ Commands class to the Application class, or what?\n\nYes, I can see that the\
    \ modeless forms in the Revit SDK EventsMonitor sample all live in the ExternalApplication\
    \ class. \n\nGood point and great catch!\n\nCheers, Jeremy."

  body: 'Dear Jeremy

    this question is not really related to this specific post above. but i have no
    other way to contact you ;)


    i was wondering about 2 things for cording and maybe you know if it would be possible
    (and if, how)


    1) Coordinates. for a pileplan i really want to get the X and Y (and if possible
    Z too) to be used in the Schedules.

    Now i found some stuff like "RBS_PROJECT_LOCATION_PARAM" and i think this is what
    should be used ?

    maybe you can make some info on this subject too ?


    2) Schedules have no option within the revit 2011 program to sort/filter on the
    Type name of elements. so currently we have added a text parameter and make it
    the same as type name by hand. and than it is possible so sort/filter on that.
    but as you can see it is a real de-tour. now i wonder, how you look at this problem?
    again i found this  "ALL_MODEL_TYPE_NAME" and maybe it would be possible to link
    some param to this one ? so there cant be made typing errors ?

    maybe this can be a nice subject too for this blog ?

  body: 'Dear Dante,


    Thank you for the suggestions!


    Yes, these would definitely be wonderful subjects for the blog.


    Right now I have no time at all for research, unfortunately, we have masses of
    ADN questions, a backlog from the Developer Days conference tour, and end-of-year
    administrative tasks.


    I wish I had more time...


    Still, I can definitely say that the second issue seems very easy to address in
    one way or another. You could for example create a shared parameter and simply
    programmatically populate it with the type name of each element. That is really
    easy to do.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    I will aks them too to take some look at it later on, although i guess they are
    also pretty busy at the moment ;-)


    looking forward to the blogs.'

  body: "hi Jeremy,\n\nIMO, moving the variable and its accordingly codes to application\
    \ is one good enhancement, it can avoid potential resource problem mentioned above,\
    \ though this sample has no such problem currently.\n\nAs a matter of fact, the\
    \ idling handler(app_Idling) is yet another potential ehance: because it belongs\
    \ to Command class, it has same defect with Form resource, it'll be better if\
    \ this handler belongs to Application class too. \n\nIn other words, if events\
    \ will be triggered by UI operations(or outside Command domain), it's safer if\
    \ the handlers/resources live within Application class.\n\nComments above are\
    \ just personal best practicses, FYI."
