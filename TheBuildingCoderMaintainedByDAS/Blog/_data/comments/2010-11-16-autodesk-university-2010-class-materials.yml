  body: 'Dear Jeremy,

    I am working on a process to create some sections during automation routine, to
    create section I used Autodesk.Revit.Creation.NewViewSection method, which creates
    horizontal sections under detail views branch (Later i found out mention about
    this in developer guide pdf ) However, I need to create vertical section(wall
    section). How can I create it?'

  body: 'Dear Jenney,


    I assume that you mean NewViewSection, not NewSectionView. I am astounded how
    much people love to type, and hate to copy and paste. I avoid typing at all costs
    -- to avoid typos.


    As far as I know, the method NewViewSection(BoundingBoxXYZ) can create vertical
    views:

  body: "Dear Emmanuel,\n\nThank you for the slightly funny question. I hope you will\
    \ be appropriately horrified to hear that this was not even possible in the Revit\
    \ API prior to Revit 2011. Happily, the Revit 2011 API provides a PickPoint method,\
    \ so that the code could be very roughly translated to \n\nXYZ targetPoint \n\
    \  = m_document.Selection\n    .PickPoint(\"Please pick a point.\");\n\nThis line\
    \ is taken from the Revit SDK sample 'Selections'.\n\nCheers, Jeremy."

  body: "Dear Jeremy, \nI think i did copy and paste the method ,but you made a read\
    \ typo!! :)\nAnyways, I looked into the link you sent me before i posted the first\
    \ comment as i used the same method to cut section but it always comes back with\
    \ a horizontal cut section created under detail view branch in tree.Have you been\
    \ able to test this method to create vertical section?\n I also found out about\
    \ it later in \"Revit 2011 API Developer Guide.pdf\" page 218 - in last paragraph/Note.\
    \ Which basically says \"When you create a section using the command View > New\
    \ > Section, the created view is located in the Sections (Building Section) node\
    \ in the Project Browser. The view class type is Elements.View, and the view type\
    \ is ViewType.Section. However, when you create a section using the Autodesk.Revit.Creation.NewViewSection\
    \ method(), the created view is in the Detail Views (Detail) node. The class type\
    \ is Elements.ViewSection and the view type is ViewType.Detail.\""

  body: 'Dear Jenney,


    So you did, and I apologise. Yes, the read typo happened because I was referring
    to another document as well which included that mistake which shocked me so.


    Thank you very much for the reference to the developer guide. I was aware of this
    fact, I guess, but not the explicit statement. That helps a lot.


    Since I never look much at the user interface, I never worried about where the
    view appeared in the browser, but now that you explain it I understand that it
    might be significant for some users, or most, in fact.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    I can still ignore the fact that it places the view in different location in browser,
    but I am not aware of any other methods to cut the vertical section. Would you
    know any other way to make it work?'

    thanks for the advanced copy of the class handouts.  Can you tell me if the "Exactly
    what you want and faster: Autodesk Revit 2011 Programming Optimization" is the
    correct handout.  all three handouts have different info on them but the page
    headers all read for "CP316-3U - All systems Go in Autodesk Revit MEP Programming"


    Thanks again.'

    Thank you ever so much for pointing that out!


    That is a typo, of course. I corrected the headers and posted updated versions
