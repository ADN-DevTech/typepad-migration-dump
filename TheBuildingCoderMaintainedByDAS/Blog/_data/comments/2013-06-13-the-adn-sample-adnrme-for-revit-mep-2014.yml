    I''d really like to see the RevitLookup tool posted to Github.


    I''ve probably updated it 150 times over the years, to include some bit of information
    that was not being exposed - but when the next release came around I had to decide
    between losing my version or doing all the work in converting and upgrading it.


    Wouldn''t it be great if we could all benefit from each other''s updates to it?'

  body: 'Dear Matt,


    Yes, absolutely!


    Thank you for the suggestion.


    That is exactly our intention.


    Meanwhile, you could always certainly have sent me your changes in the past to
    get them integrated into the main version.


    GitHub would hopefully make that process much simpler, though.


    Top priority.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    Some ADN examples are based on Revit MEP 2014.  Will it also work on Revit Architecture
    2014 or not?


    Thanks,

    They will work as long as no MEP-specific API calls are made, which might return
    null, e.g. the MEPModel property. They are very few, though.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    I talked this over with the development team and now finally got around to doing
    it.


    RevitLookup now lives in its own RevitLookup repository on GitHub:


    <a href="https://github.com/jeremytammik/RevitLookup">https://github.com/jeremytammik/RevitLookup</a>


    Could you please add the updates you mentioned to it, assuming that they are applicable
    in Revit 2014 and of interest and use to the general Revit API community?


    I guess that will involve:


    <ul>

    <li>Clone the repository to your local system</li>

    <li>Add the changes</li>

    <li>Merge it back again</li>

    </ul>


    Please make brief notes of the steps you take to clone, pull, add, commit and
    push back changes.


    We can talk directly about getting you the appropriate write credentials.


    I am very much looking forward to  there!


    From then onwards, we can all work together to ensure that they are retained and
    maintained moving forward.


    I am very much looking forward to seeing your changes added and working cooperatively
    on this!


    Thank you!


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    Thank you for the discussions we had and the contributions you already made!


    The RevitLookup GitHub repository is described in public now as well:
