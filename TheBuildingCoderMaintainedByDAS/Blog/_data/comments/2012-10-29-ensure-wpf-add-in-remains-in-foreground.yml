    I had already encountered with the WPF Modal Window bug. I described it in the
    case #06929715 and the problem still didn''t resolve.


    As I can notice sometimes WPF modal window become non-modal in some cases <b>even
    if</b> Owner is specified. I can''t determine when it happens and to reproduce
    this behavior but the problem is really exists.


    Regards, Victor.'

    Thank you for the important pointer!


    I looked at the case you mention. From its description, it sounds as if it were
    mainly concerned with extensible storage.


    Since this WPF issue seems to be a totally separate topic, it might help if you
    could submit a separate case for that.


    I am sorry to hear that it is not reproducible. A reproducible case would make
    if much easier and more convincing to describe and provide an invaluable basis
    for working towards a resolution.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    As I remember a WPF modal window became non-modal if any Revit message dialog
    appears.

    If I don''t forget, I''ll try to find dependence in WPF modal dialog behavior,
    when I encountered next time with the issue.

    Thank you. Actually, I now found your resulting SPR #218817 as well and added
    some comments to it.


    I hope the workaround described above solves the issue in all your cases as well.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    Wow, cool, seriously? Thanks! Do you understand it? For me the text and story
    and philosophy behind it is a lot more important than the music.

  body: 'hi Jeremy,


    i have more general questions, if we''re going to buy new VS, is Microsoft Visual
    Studio Pro -VsPro2012 OLP the correct one to buy?


    currently we''re using both Revit 2012 and Revit 2013, for API development, most
    likely we''ll still use Revit 2012 for now due to obvious reason, is VS2012 OK
    for both Revit 2013 and 2012 API?


    if we buy 2010 version first then upgrade to 2012 later, are there any issues
    like price-wise?


    many thanks.


    Joe'

    Price-wise, I cannot say anything at all. I have no idea about prices, since I
    have an MSDN subscription and can download any MS development software I need.


    I think you can use both VS 2010 and 2012 for both Revit 2012 and 2013. The .NET
    framework shields you well from differences. All you need to ensure is that you
    support .NET 4.0, I think. Or was it 3.5 for Revit 2012? Look in the developer
    guide system requirements for 2012, and in the wikihelp for 2013:
