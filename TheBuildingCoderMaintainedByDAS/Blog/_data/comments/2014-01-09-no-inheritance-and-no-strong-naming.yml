  body: 'I find the reasons Autodesk doesn''t digitally sign their API assemblies
    to be somewhat lame.  I believe only the first 2 octets of a version number "count"
    when a .NET add-in loads a digitally signed assembly (only change the later digits,
    guys, or don''t change it at all because only one ever gets loaded at runtime,
    right?), and SO WHAT if you need to deploy it to the GAC to improve performance???  (That''s
    the real reason, as I read it...Autodesk''s complex installer can''t do gacutil
    -i???)


    In our case, we have reusable DLLs that depend on the Revit API DLLs, and those
    reusable DLLs are used in multiple add-ins (with separate installs to separate
    folders, conforming to the Autodesk Exchange Apps requirements).  As the Revit
    API DLLs aren''t signed, we can''t sign our reusable DLLs.


    If an older add-in is run first, it loads our older reusable DLLs into memory
    and because they''re not signed those older ones that are already in memory will
    get used by the newer add-in, which when run may really depend on features in
    a newer version of the reusable DLL that shipped with it.  Crashola.  Or worse:  quiet
    misbehaving.


    As neither "workaround" is suitable for us, the inability for us to <i>easily</i>
    sign our reusable DLLs that depend on the Revit API with Visual Studio can actually
    be quite problematic.'

  body: Hmmm...upon further reflection I can see how the version number problem could
    be more complicated than I first thought.  You could publish all versions to the
    GAC with every update release, but then any bug fixes may not get picked up automatically
    by add-ins that were originally built against older releases of the API DLLs.  Obviously
    that would be desirable.  Ugggh.

  body: 'Dear CoderBoy,


    Thank you very much for your input!


    Do you have access to the Autodesk beta Meridian forum?


    That is the origin of this discussion. It would be cool if you would like to explore
    this further there directly with members of the development team.


    Meanwhile, I have passed on your suggestions internally.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: To put it frankly, the Revit API is an abomination. It should be taught as
    a model of how not to program at CS schools everywhere. I could spend hours talking
    about the coding horrors one has to make just to do something trivial (in other
    CAD programs) like applying a transform to a solid, or infer a relation between
    a bunch of objects. And let's not forget about the "wise" decision of only allowing
    access from managed languages. This makes wonders for the performance of the code
    :) And don't even mention the word multi-threaded, it is an unknown concept in
    the Revit world.

  body: 'Dear Adrian,


    Wow, cool.


    Thank you for your frank view  :-)


    I very sincerely hope nobody is forcing you to work with the Revit API!


    I wish you the very best of luck on all your (hopefully) non-Revit related programming
    projects!


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: "I hear you, Adrian, I really do. However, I would like you to (try) understand\
    \ that there are always important reasons for the decisions the Revit R&D makes\
    \ and serious considerations are always part of the decision process. For one,\
    \ we believe that having a .NET API shell over Revit native internal provides\
    \ most users with more stable platform, and that applies to Revit API developers\
    \ as well as the end users that enjoy their add-ins. In my personal opinion, the\
    \ .NET environment makes the API also more approachable to users that aren’t professional\
    \ developers. At the same time, we do not restrict what advanced developers can\
    \ do in their add-ins. If they wish to delegate some heavy calculations to other\
    \ modules written in unmanaged languages, they quite easily may do that. In fact,\
    \ Revit supplies some of its own add-ons that are written as multi-language, the\
    \ cloud renderer being one example.\nAs for multithreading, I actually do not\
    \ believe our users think we ignore their wishes and requests out of spite. I\
    \ know they understand that putting together a multithreaded environment is not\
    \ trivial. It is not easy to write such applications from scratch. It is far more\
    \ difficult to rewrite an old application to be completely multithreaded. And\
    \ even with that difficulty being always part of the equation, some applications\
    \ are just mode difficult to multithread than others. I am not saying impossible,\
    \ but sometimes it is just too darn hard. Revit actually has many internal components\
    \ that are threaded; however, trying to thread access to a database as complex\
    \ and tiered as Revit’s data model is another task all together.\nI’d like to\
    \ add one comment about the complexity (and, well, ugliness) of the Revit API.\
    \ I think the same could be said about Revit itself when comparing it with other\
    \ applications. Revit is indeed different. I do believe there are trivial tasks\
    \ that would take minutes to do in AutoCAD while they can take an hour easily\
    \ in Revit. On the other hand, however, I would not have to be pressed hard to\
    \ come up with tasks which take minutest in Revit, but days in AutoCAD. I believe\
    \ the same sentiment can be extended to other platforms and applications. There\
    \ are users who swear to be much faster on their Macs then others can be on their\
    \ Windows, and vice versa. And of course, the Unix hard-core crowd swears to be\
    \ much more efficient with their command lines than all the GUI lovers combined.\
    \ :-) But at the end of the day it is all about the right tool for the right tasks,\
    \ isn’t it.\n \nArnošt Löbel\nSr. Principal Engineer\nAutodesk, Revit R&D\n\n\
