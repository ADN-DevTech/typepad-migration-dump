  body: 'Dear Jeremy,

    Sometimes, The Min and Max of the Element BoundingBox are not Exactly Equals the
    physical point,

    I draw a detail lines from a certain point to every max of the element,

    Kindly find the image in this link,

    How can I solve this issue?

  body: 'Dear Modar,


    Please be aware that a Revit element may display completely differently in different
    views, e.g. plan, elevation, 3D, section, etc.


    The bounding box has to include the extents of all possible views.


    If you wish to obtain more accurate limits on the element extents, you might retrieve,
    parse and tessellate the 3D geometry and calculate the maximum and minimum points
    of all the vertices produced.


    The concrete setout points add-in shows how to determine all geometry vertices:

    I implemented a whole bunch of utility classes and methods to retrieve and sort
    unique vertices from element geometry here in the past. This discussion mentions
    a few of them:

    I hope this helps.


    Cheers, Jeremy.
