  body: 'Hi Jeremy,


    some remarks:


    OST_Planting has no material quantities, so if you omit elements of this category,
    you won''t export trees, for example.


    When iterating recursively through FamilyInstances'' geometry, through their Subcomponents
    etc., it may be useful to limit the iteration depth.

    Why getting the geometry of each door knob...?


    If any face has regions, you should query those sub-faces because they may have
    different materials.

    People usually split faces to assign other materials to them, I think.


    It may be senseful if you transform the geometry by centering it, depending on
    the viewer you plan to use.



    Cheers,

    Rudi'

    another point:


    If the element is a FamilyInstance, you should check its parameters.

    If one of them is of ParameterType.FamilyType, you may find the relating element
    (param.AsElementId etc.) and get its geometry, too.

    you wrote:

    "Add support for colour".


    Think of windows.

    You will also need *transparency* values.


    ;-)

    Thank you!


    Good suggestion!


    I don''t really care that much, though. I do want the building to look recognisable,
    but not aim for full-blown photo-realistic rendering, so I think I''ll skip that
    one.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    Hmh? I don''t quite understand the purpose of this?

  body: 'Dear Rudi,


    I think I will happily skip plants for this particular exercise.


    I am not explicitly iterating into any family instances, just grabbing the top
    level geometry returned to me by the Revit get_Geometry call on the elements traversed
    by the collector. Since I am not recursing into anything, I do not see where to
    apply the limitation that you suggest.


    Your suggestions about handling split faces and transforming the geometry definitely
    make sense and should be kept in mind.


    Again, happily, this is just an exercise to get something recognisable out there
    and into the cloud for consumption on mobile devices, so I''ll try hard to keep
    it simple and leave the frills to you guys.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    since we cannot access material textures, there is no chance to create a photo-realistic
    rendering.


    Sadly.
