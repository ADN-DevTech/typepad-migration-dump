  body: 'Dear Ryan,


    Thank you very much for your appreciation.


    I am very glad and above all grateful to Brett that we could bring this forward
    so far so fast.


    Looking forward to that beer in Las Vegas!


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: 'Dear Chris,


    There are some small but significant enhancements to the geometry API.


    I cannot tell off-hand, though, nor do I know exactly what you are after.


    Please take a look as soon as you can obtain a version and let us know if it leaves
    anything to be desired.


    If so, please provide a reproducible case for us to understand your needs, exactly
    what you are trying to achieve, and how, and what behaviour you are observing,
    so we can raise a wish list item for any missing functionality, i.e.:


    <ul>

    <li>A complete yet minimal Revit sample model to run a test in.</li>

    <li>A complete yet minimal Visual Studio solution with add-in manifest so that
    we can compile, load and run the application with a single click and explore its
    behaviour live in the sample model you provide.</li>

    <li>Detailed step-by-step instructions for reproducing the issue.</li>

    <li>Specification of the exact behaviour you observe versus what you expect.</li>

    </ul>


    Thank you!


    I am sorry to say that if you did not already submit a wish list item specifying
    your exact needs in the past, it is quite unlikely that they have been fulfilled
    now, you know.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: I got five errors after compiling the API samples.  All were related to the
    STLImportCommand.  After "fixing" them the commands won't work for me.

  body: 'Dear Mike,


    Thank you for your report.


    Do you mean the samples demonstrating the new Revit 2015 API functionality?


    Please be aware that these samples were created for an early pre-release and have
    not been updated or tested since.


    They probably require adaptation for the final version.


    Are you testing them on Revit 2015 UR1?


    What are the five errors you see?


    How did you fix them?


    What behaviour are you expecting?


    What is the behaviour you observe?


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    This is a great alternative to always having to use keyboard for ''keyboard shortcuts''.


    Now all I need is collapse/expand all for view/sheet/family browser.'

  body: 'Hello Jeremy,


    Can you please provide the full command for this. I have no idea how to input
    this to create my own.


    I am clueless when it comes to API  even though I would really enjoy learning
    about how it works...


    This would mean a lot to me even if it is still in development. I have been waiting
    for something like this for a long time.


    Respectfully,


    Corbin
