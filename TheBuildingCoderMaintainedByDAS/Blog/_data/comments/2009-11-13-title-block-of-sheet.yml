  body: "Hi Jeremy,\nI know from reading some of your posts how to use a dictionary\
    \ to create a one-to-one relationship between the title block and the view sheet\
    \ which is rather cool. \n\nHowever now I want to use a conditional to check the\
    \ existence of viewports of a scale greater than say 1:50 hosted on a sheet view.\n\
    These are my issues...\nI can access the scale of a view not a viewport. Further\
    \ I cant access the sheet number that the viewport belongs to even though I can\
    \ see it in the views properties. Can you help?\ncheers,\nFrank Halliday"

  body: 'Dear Frank,


    I am glad that you found some useful dictionary examples here.


    Yes, both cool and simple, isn''t it?


    I cannot really say anything at all about these issues off-hand.


    You would need to explore a real live model of yours in some depth using RevitLookup
    or other more in-depth tools, e.g. the Python or Ruby shells:

    Have you looked for the ViewSheet.SheetNumber and View.Scale properties? Can you
    access them anywhere in your situation?


    Cheers, Jeremy.
