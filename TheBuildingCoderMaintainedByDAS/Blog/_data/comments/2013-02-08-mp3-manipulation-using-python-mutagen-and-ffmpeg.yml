  body: 'Hello Jeremy,

    I have 80,000 elements to generate, now I use sweep, do you know sweep and extrusion
    which is faster? and which can offer a better performance for the computer?


    It took 40 hours for the sweep operations.

    Is it possible to accelerate the operations?

    In rhino script, only 10 minutes is enough for this operation.


    Hope to see you reply!'

  body: 'Dear Jeremy,



    Thank you for your quick reply.



    I am now working in a project plan team for the design of Arch_Tec_Lab in ETH
    Zürich. You can refer to the below &nbsp;youtube link.


    <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzKfXra9o54">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzKfXra9o54</a>



    The parametric roof is generated in Rhino by my colleague, and the wooden beams
    will be assembled by robotic arms.




    Before my join this team, they imported the roof (including roof wooden structure)
    in DWG format, which could not show right in some plan view or section view. And
    in 3D view, it always led to revit crash because of so many triangle meshes and
    this imported format.&nbsp;




    So I wrote a plugin to import the wooden beams (around 8k) of the roof.&nbsp;



    We choose xml to exchange the position information. And I choose sweep instead
    of extrusion to generate each beam(which I also have question about the performance
    of these methods to inquire you).




    For now, the roof structure is divided into 7 parts of xml, which was generated
    into 7 families.It took me about 20 hours by using 3 dell precision computers.



    Because the roof will be modified in the following days for some times, so I am
    now finding a way to reduce the generation time.




    I found that the speed of sweep is slower when the amount&nbsp;increased, and
    the regeneration which I can not avoid &nbsp;is especially slow when the amount
    is above 1500.



    Yesterday I found a way to&nbsp;accelerate&nbsp;the generation greatly.


    I did like this: divided each 1 part &nbsp;into 24 pieces sections with the mark
    in XML, then generate each section into single family, and then combine them into
    a major family.&nbsp;

    these action all made by plugin.




    which is much more quicker.





    Let me introduce our project once again.



    The Arch_Tec_Lab is a role model project of department of Architecture, ETH Zürich.
    And the team include most important professors in Institue of Technology in Architecture.
    The project aims to realize the BIM control in the life circle. Now we using Revit
    to a extremely detail, and we enjoy the cloud rendering in autodesk 360, except
    we wish it can realize animation rendering. &nbsp;Now we are working for the construction
    drawings in Revit.




    In Switzerland, few architects use Autodesk products, because of the majority
    of the MAC users. But we want build a model for the architects and the students
    in department.



    We proposed once that we want to apply the chance of being the loading image of
    the future Revit Version. I don&#39;t know whether you can help.




    Thank you very much for your time!



    Best Wishes,



    Hu'

  body: 'Hi Jeremy,

    I would like to track the intersections of a type of element with another type
    of element in another revit drawing that I have linked in using the "Link Revit"
    function. I tried and was unable to get ElementIntersectsElementFilter to track
    the intersection. Do you have any suggestion for me to achieve this?

  body: 'Hi Jeremy,


    Thank you for maintaining this website. This has helped me a lot so far.


    I would be very grateful if you could clarify something about family documents
    for me. Let''s say you extract a piece of geometry such as an extrusion from a
    family document. Is there a way to figure out to if the lines/edges/faces creating
    that piece of geometry are locked to reference planes or other family geometry
    (e.g. a trim being locked to a wall face)? I went through obtaining all Sketches/CurveArrays/Curves
    of extrusions in the hope that the Reference property of Curve class would direct
    to the constraint that the curve is locked to. But none of the references I could
    get pointed to a reference plane, while the family document has several extrusions
    with edges locked to many constraints.


    Another thing I tried was the get_Geometry method, but don''t know about any property
    that can give that information to me.


    I have spent a good amount of time trying to find this out. I would appreciate
    if you could inform me whether this is possible at all, and if so, how I can go
    about it.


    Thanks,


    Mike'

    The filter will currently not automatically honour or follow links.


    You will have to parse the linked file yourself, access the geometry of interest
    to you, and recreate it appropriately transformed in the host project document
    to implement that.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    Thank you for your appreciation. I am glad it helps.


    Cool question!


    You need to realise that these constraints are created programmatically though
    the ItemFactoryBase.NewAlignment method and generate locked alignment dimension
    elements.


    It should be possible to search for these elements.


    On these, the Dimension.References property returns an array of geometric references
    to which the dimension is attached.


    Please let me know whether this works for you. If you could provide a small working
    sample, I would promote this to a main blog post. Thank you!


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: I tried the MP3 artist code. The good news? It worked - it did add the album
    artist tag. The bad news? It erased all other existing tags. Since I've had bad
    luck with this before I created a backup and tested on that. But is there a way
    to run that code without wiping out the other ID3 tags? Thank you.

    Wow, whoops, I am very sorry indeed to hear that.


    Good thing you made a backup.


    Strange though... it worked for me just the way it is listed above.


    Haven''t used it for a while, though...


    From your description, I don''t know exactly which code above you are referring
    to...


    Did you grab just a partial snippet and adapt it to your needs?


    Yes, certainly you can add tags without wiping out the existing ones.


    For instance, you can read the collection of all the existing tags, append a new
    entry to it, and write the updated and expanded list back to the audio data.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    The only difference to the code was I specified my test directory instead of current
    directory ("."). But I did run it on Windows instead of Linux - and Windows might
    handle ID3 tags differently.


    I''ll try it on Linux and see how it works.'
