  body: 'Nice article !


    If you are interested in NoSQL-ish-data management take a look at Open Source
    BimServer. It uses a key/value store. However, not queryable by ordinary SQL,
    a custom query language named BimQL has been invented.

    Thank you for your appreciation. I am glad you like it.


    Thank you for the pointer as well. I looked at <a href="http://bimserver.org.">http://bimserver.org.</a>


    Do you know whether there are any free open BimServer hosts around that one can
    make use of?


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: 'I''m very disappointed with Iriscouch. It does not offer any kind of support
    and is impossible to use it in production. After the second time my CouchDB instance
    crashed and was left down for 3 days, withouth any chance for me to contact someone
    to have it back online... I searched for another couchdb hosting provider.. and
    I found Smileupps!


    <a href="https://www.smileupps.com">https://www.smileupps.com</a>


    Smileupps is very very stable, offers top class support and has a marketplace
    to easily sell my couchapps.


    Moreover after the Iriscouch acquisition by Nodejitsu and recent Nodejitsu acquisition
    by GoDaddy, it seems Irisouch service is going to close very soon
