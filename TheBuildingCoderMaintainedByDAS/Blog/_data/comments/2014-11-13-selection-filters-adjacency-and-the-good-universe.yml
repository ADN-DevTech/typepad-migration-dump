    I have not found the place to ask a question. Google search did not help me.

    Explain me, please, if possible, how it works - VG/Filters/Filter Rules - I mean
    criteria operator specifically for Workset - how must "is greater than" work?
    Wthat is the logic? (first letter or order or smth else)

    Im trying to find a description of this process in API - and failed. Thank you!'

  body: 'Dear Andrey,


    When searching for answers to questions like this, it makes sense to explore the
    behaviour through the standard Revit product user interface first.


    The API normally does change anything significant, just provide programmatic access
    to the underlying UI functionality.


    I hope you have got this resolved by now?


    Cheers, Jeremy.
