  body: 'Dear Steven,


    I am afraid there is more to it than just installing. The zip file contains the
    source code for a Revit add-in. To understand how to compile and install it, please
    refer to the getting started material available here and from the Revit developer
    centre:

    You will probably want to begin with the DevTV and My first plug-in video tutorials.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: I was wondering if this code could be modified in a way that would allow a
    user to select a scope box to apply the section box?  For instance, a project
    that has multiple scope boxs.

  body: "Jeremy,\n\nI'm trying to disable the section box from the default 3d view\
    \ to better use referenceinteresector for some tasks.  According to the View3d\
    \ definition, I need to pass Null through the View3d.GetSectionBox() command for\
    \ Revit versions 2014 and later. How would I do that?\nThanks,\nIan \n\nP.S.Thanks\
    \ for maintaining such a great blog. I wouldn't stand a chance without this resource."

  body: 'I tried this and received the error message "The input argument "boundingBoxXYZ"
    of function Autodesk::Revit::DB::View3D::SetSectionBox or one item in the collection
    is null..."  According to the remarks in Autodesk.Revit.DB View3D definition,
    the section box is suppose to be disabled by passing in null or a disabled box
    with the GetSectionBox() command.  Odd since the GetSectionBox command returns
    the BoundingBoxXYZ and does not accept inputs.
