    some notices:


    I found out that there could be the case that Element.Level property is null while
    a Level parameter contains a *valid* value.


    Also, think of the fact that the BuiltInParameter (for displaying the Level) may
    be depending on Element''s type and/or Category.


    Type Area''s level is represented by BIP.ROOM_LEVEL_ID, for example...


    "ROOM" !? It''s the same with the BIP.DOOR_COST parameter (which can be found
    by elements which aren''t doors at all).



    Cheers,

    Rudolf'

    I have created a family of elements and asked them the dimension values (width,
    hight, lenght and volume).

    They are displayed only in the type properties.

    How do I get these values? (C#, Revit 2011)'

  body: 'Dear Aleksey,


    To query the type properties instead of the instance ones, retrieve the parameter
    from the type element instead of the instance element.


    This is demonstrated in numerous places, e.g. by the BipChecker:
