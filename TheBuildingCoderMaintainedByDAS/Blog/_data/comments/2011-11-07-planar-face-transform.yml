  body: 'Hi Jeremy,


    I''m looking to code a routine to generate a partition/curtain wall that is not
    vertical.  My approach was to generate in a vertical plane derived from an edge,
    then rotate it into it''s orientation about this linear edge.  But it seems walls
    can only be rotated in plan as it doesn''t move when I call ElementTransformUtils.RotateElement
    with a non vertical line.  Can you please confirm?  Also, if I wish to detach
    the top of the wall from a level, can you please demonstrate what you would set
    this parameter to?  BuiltInParameter.WALL_TOP_IS_ATTACHED


    If there are any other API methods to generate non vertical walls, would be greatly
    appreciated to find out about them.


    Cheers,  Jon


    Thanks in advance,


    Jon'
