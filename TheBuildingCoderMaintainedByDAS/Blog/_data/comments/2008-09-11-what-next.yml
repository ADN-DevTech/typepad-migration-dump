  body: "Hi Jeremy,\n\nGreat to see you have started a blog - I've pulled late nights\
    \ to catch some of your web casts (starting at around 2am my time!) in the past,\
    \ and am pleased to see some more revit information being put into the blogosphere.\
    \ \n\nA topic I would like to hear more on is stuff like adding rebar to slabs,\
    \ and other functionality that involves using Geometry, location points and other\
    \ modeling based stuff. The examples and RevitMgDebug do a good job of showing\
    \ off the database and some of the great stuff you can do with that, but something\
    \ i find harder to grasp just from example code is the 3d type geometry stuff.\n\
    \nThanks,\n\nRod Howarth"

    About \"What's next\" I'd like to see in Revit something about generative modeling/architecture\

    \ does not exist nothing on the net about Revit.\nThanks,\n\nArturo Montieri"

  body: 'Hi Rod and Arturo,


    Thank you both very much for your appreciation and interesting suggestions! I
    agree that the Revit element geometry is less directly accessible and understandable
    than some other areas, and will definitely add some notes on that soon. The other
    areas you mention I see further down the road.


    Best regards,


    Jeremy'

  body: 'Hi Arturo,


    Do you have some concrete suggestions for generative modelling or architecture?
    If so, and if something small and clever could be implemented relatively fast,
    Kean Walmsley''s F# contest may be of interest to you:
