  body: "Hi Jeremy,\n\nI have found a new solution for the Create wall offset problem\
    \ using the Revit 2015 API. \nI make a Curveloop of the boundarysegments of the\
    \ room, and then use the new function CurveLoop.CreateViaOffset, to offset the\
    \ curveloop half the width of the new wall from the room boundary.\nI than use\
    \ these curves for the creation of new walls. \n\nOne question with regard to\
    \ this. Is it possible to make use of this revit 2015 API function for revit 2014\
    \ add ins?? For example by creating a seperate class library that uses CurveLoop.CreateViaOffset\
    \ and revit 2015 References, which can be used by a 2014 command?\n \n\nBest,\n\
    \nJesse"

  body: 'Dear Jesse,


    Brilliant. Thank you very much for sharing that.


    Yes, that is indeed a prime example of using this new functionality, which did
    not exist when the original discussion was published.


    I think you would have some difficulty making use of this in a Revit 2014 add-in.
    The add-in would have to reference the Revit 2014 API assemblies to connect to
    Revit 2014, and the Revit 2015 ones for the new method. That sounds like a conflict
    to me.


    You could always try to use the corresponding built-in AcGe functionality instead,
    if you really want:

    Probably equally difficult, but less conflict...


    Cheers, Jeremy.'
