    Revit will not fire any event for the Escape key.


    If you want to catch that, you will have to use Windows or .NET events, and they
    may possibly not interact well with the Revit API.


    So you are on your own there. Good luck!

    I can only suggest retrieving the Windows screen or client rectangle coordinates

    be translated to Revit XYZ model or view coordinates, so it will probably not
    be of much use to you in any case.

    I have no idea what you mean by "Segments and Sizes entire list information".


    Just like in previous versions of Revit, you can easily use the API to iterate
    over all building elements, extract their geometry, and export that data in any
    shape or form you please, including breaking it down into lists of segments and
    sizes.


    Have fun!

  body: 'Dear Mallikarjuna,


    I would strongly advise you to avoid having two different DLLs with the same name.
    I would also ensure that the DLLs are all copied to one single consistent location.
    If you wish to make serious use of any .NET functionality from a Revit add-in,
    I would advise installing the add-in DLL and all its dependencies in the same
    directory as revit.exe, or in a subdirectory of that location:


    "The easiest way to make full use of some of the more complex .NET framework features
    which involve security settings and access rights, for example application settings
    and resource handling, is to install a class assembly in the same directory as
    the executable defining the AppDomain loading the it, i.e. Revit.exe in the Revit
    executable folder, which is the Program subdirectory under the Revit main installation
    folder. One example of this is making use of the using System.Configuration namespace
    to store application settings. The general recommendation for both AutoCAD.NET
    and Revit add-ins is for the installer to install the external command into the
    main application executable folder."

    They are based on examining some string describing the element.


    A more reliable approach would be to go via the element geometry, determine the
    faces of the connectors, and analyse their shape geometrically.


    That is something I would like to do one of these days...
