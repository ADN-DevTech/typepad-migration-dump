  body: "Some comments:\n\nWhen I tried parts of this code, I discovered that the\
    \ .Normal function of the PlanarFace object sometimes shows incorrect values for\
    \ faces with a positive or negative z-direction. \n\nThis especially affects the\
    \ code part:\n\nif( f is PlanarFace && PointsUpwards( ((PlanarFace)f).Normal )\
    \ )\n\nA solution that so far has given me correct values is to replace the .Normal\
    \ function of the PlanarFace object with the .ComputeNormal function.\n\nI found\
    \ problems when analyzing faces that had a positive or negative z-value of its\
    \ normal. So, not only the boundary faces of the wall but also top and bottom\
    \ faces of its openings...\n\n/Henrik\n-----"
