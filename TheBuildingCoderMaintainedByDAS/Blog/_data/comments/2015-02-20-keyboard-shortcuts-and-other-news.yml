  body: 'On the keyboard shortcut issue, I''ve merged my custom XML saved keyboard
    shortcuts with the user''s XML file. (Using standard .NET XML tools.) You''d need
    to check for conflicts etc.

    I seem to remember there was an issue if the user hadn''t ever edited the keyboard
    shortcuts. Can''t remember any more than that though!'
