    No need for a help page to answer that question.


    The classes, methods and properties provided are the sum of all the Revit API
    functionality plus everything provided by the standard Ruby and Python environments.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: 'Hi,


    I don''t know if it is the right place to ask, but I''m looking for information
    on how to install (step by step) RevitPythonShell with Revit 2015 (I have the
    trial version). I installed IronPython, downloaded and installed RevitPythonShell,
    but then I''m supposed to go in the Add-in tab of Revit.. but this tab doesn''t
    exist ?!


    What am I missing ?

    Thanks a lot !

    Arnaud.'

    I would say no.


    I would suggest to look for that information on the RevitPythonShell home page:


    <a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?q=RevitPythonShell">http://lmgtfy.com/?q=RevitPythonShell</a>


    The top google hit is the project home page:


    <a href="https://code.google.com/p/revitpythonshell">https://code.google.com/p/revitpythonshell</a>


    I would assume that all you need to do is to run the installer:


    <a href="http://sustain.arch.ethz.ch/DPV/Setup_RevitPythonShell_2015.exe">http://sustain.arch.ethz.ch/DPV/Setup_RevitPythonShell_2015.exe</a>


    If that does not work and you do not find it an answer to your question there,
    please post it there as well, so that others with the same issue will easily see
    both your question and the answer.


    Thank you!


    Cheers, Jeremy.
