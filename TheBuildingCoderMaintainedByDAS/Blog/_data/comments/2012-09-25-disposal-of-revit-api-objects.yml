  body: "Hi Jeremy,\n\nI seemingly encountered a memory issue a couple of weeks ago.\
    \ I tried to  create a set of view sheets most of which were inserted a raster\
    \ image. After about 25+ view sheets created, I found my Windows is close to running\
    \ out of memory (93% of physical memory usage), while CPU usage was fine.I noticed\
    \ that the memory usage increasing along with view sheet creation one by one.\n\
    \nHere's my code to insert raster image to view sheet:\n\nprotected Element InsertImage(string\
    \ imageFile)\n{\n\tImageImportOptions options = new ImageImportOptions();\n\t\
    options.Placement = BoxPlacement.Center;\n\toptions.RefPoint = new XYZ(0, 0, 0);//图片的初始化位置为图片的几何中心在原点。\n\
    \n\tElement elemImage = null;\n\n\tusing (Transaction trans = new Transaction(RevitDoc))\n\
    \t{\n\t\ttrans.Start(\"Insert Image\");\n\n\t\tif (!(RevitDoc.Import(imageFile,\
    \ options, ViewSheet, out elemImage)))\n\t\t{\n\t\t\tstring message = string.Format(\"\
    错误！！！向视图导入图片“{0}”\", imageFile);\n\t\t\tthrow new InvalidOperationException(message);\n\
    \t\t}\n\n\t\ttrans.Commit();\n\t}\n\n\treturn elemImage;\n}\n\nI tried to dispose\
    \ the raster image element after insertion but it didn't work. Is that possible\
    \ that Revit doesn't handle raster image element properly? Could you please give\
    \ me some hints? Thanks a lot!\n\nBest Regards,\nDavid Tan"

  body: 'I forgot to mention that all images inserted to the view sheets were actually
    exported from Revit project and family. The size of these image files are from
    500KB to 1.5MB, which I don''t think is large.
