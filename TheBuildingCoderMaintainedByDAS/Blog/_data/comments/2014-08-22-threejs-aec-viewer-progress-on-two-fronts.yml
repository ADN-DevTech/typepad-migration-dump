  body: 'Hi Jeremy


    Thanks for the nice thoughts regarding the vA3C Viewer.


    >>  You can achieve things in a matter of weeks that previously took years to
    accomplish.


    May I expand this thought of yours a bit? How''s this:


    You - as a designer, architect or PE - can achieve things in a matter of weeks
    that previously took - highly skilled computer science pros - years to accomplish.


    Another aspect is that coding is going from being a drudgery because most things
    you try seem to fail to being more like a game that''s fun because you keep succeeding
    in writing lines of code that just seem to work.


    >> The new capabilities mean that this project enables a poor man''s Navisworks
    and more, for free, today


    Perhaps the goal should be that Navisworks is complemented by the FOSS apps such
    as vA3C Viewer. An office of professionals requires stable, mature, professional
    tools - such as Navisworks.


    The FOSS viewers on the other hand are more useful for experimentation and to
    circulate designs further out and into the minds of people not directly involved
    with AEC.

    I am just back from a week in our Yellowstone National Park, observing bison,
    grizzly bears, elk, wolves and chipmunks. Survived five days with no Internet.

    Rev 6 of the vA3C Viewer should be out in a few days. It adds Drag and Drop capability
    as well as far more robust file opening capability. Once opening files becomes
    stable then it will be possible to really start adding features and trying out
    crazy fun things.


    In the meantime it would be great to have access to some more Revit files with
    BIM data that have been converted to the Three.js JSON format. This would really
    help with testing and feature development.


    Perhaps we could talk this over in the vA3C Google Group?

    Again, Jeremy, thank you for insight and your willingness to think outside of
    the box when it comes trying to solve the issues of helping more people live and
    work in safe, affordable and well-designed structures.

    Thank you for your appreciation and sharing your valuable experience here.


    You say: "... it would be great to have access to some more Revit files with BIM
    data that have been converted to the Three.js JSON format. This would really help
    with testing and feature development. Perhaps we could talk this over in the vA3C
    Google Group?"


    Yes, of course, I would love to.


    Just point me where, please, or start a new thread for the topic.


    I will love to help, and hope that it should not be a huge effort to update the
    existing Revit exporter to achieve that.


    Thank you!


    Cheers, Jeremy.
