    That sounds useful. What is it? Is it available through the API?

  body: I believe it is in the API, but in the UI you can find it near the Wall Joins
    tool on the Modify tab. As long as the beams are of the same type you should be
    able to miter them. Other than the ability to miter the tool set the priority
    beam in a connection. The tells which beam supports the other beams. By default
    the shortest beam is the supporting beam.

    Nope, I do not believe this is accessible through the API, unfortunately. I would
    love to stand corrected!
