    I believe that this is an intentional limitation because there is no clear use
    case for this and therefore it is impossible to define the proper behavior. If
    you have a good use case including an exact description of what you expect to
    see, please file a request for it through some wish list forum, e.g AUGI or ADN.


    Thank you!


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    Thank you for your kind reply.

    I just want to cut a section of a building model in oblique(not orthogonal) direction.

    ArchiCAD supports some powerful functions like that.

    I want to do that with section box because, you know, making a section view in
    Revit is not exactly intuitive. (it''s impossible to check the result of section
    work immediately)

    So, as you recommanded, I''ll send a request for it to AUGI wish list.


    Thank you again.
