  body: 'Hi,


    Can these methods be used to trace model lines around the boundary of in-place
    curtain panels? For example, when a curtain system is used, and a non-rectangular
    condition is present, Revit will generate an in-place family.  I just need to
    extract the outside face as model lines.


    Thanks'
