  body: Can the code handle the case of horizontal adjacencies for intermediate floors.
    E.g. above 1 m the space is adjacent with another space than below 1 m.

  body: 'Hi Wim,


    The code cannot handle the proposed case. The reason for this is that the code
    it fully reliant on the SpatialElementGeometryCalculator and its characteristics.
    The SpatialElementGeometryCalculator does evaluate analytical surface divisions
    which are vertical (e.g. a wall perpendicular to the space-bounding wall). It
    does not evaluate horizontal divisions (such as you suggest) or divisions of the
    floor and roof surface of the space.

    In general this code can handle the horizontal adjacencies for spaces on the same
    level. For more intricate space-geometry evaluation either the code or the SpatialElementGeometryCalculator
    would have to be elaborated.


    Hope this answers your question adequately.

    Greets,

    Jasper'

    I''m working exactly on the same problematic for a french company involved in
    thermal calculation on buildings.


    To do these calculations, I have to determine space/element adjacencies.

    To do that, I''m using a very similar algorithm based on "CalculateSpatialElementGeometry"
    results for every MEP Space of a project.


    It appears that, on several projects, these results are not consistent ...

    The first call to "CalculateSpatialElementGeometry" on a specific Space gives
    a certain result, and subsequent calls give another result (that remains consistent
    for calls number 2 and after).


    Do you face the same problem ?'

  body: 'Hi Olivier,


    I never faced that problem myself. But I never used my code on bigger projects,
    only on my (small) testproject. It might have something to do with the cache Revit
    maintains, or with the cache being cleared and filled again because of an element
    alteration during the process. (see <a href="http://204.236.145.181/Revit/enu/2012/Help/API_Dev_Guide/0074-Revit_Ge74/0108-Geometry108/Room_and_Space_Geometry).">http://204.236.145.181/Revit/enu/2012/Help/API_Dev_Guide/0074-Revit_Ge74/0108-Geometry108/Room_and_Space_Geometry).</a>
    But I would have to reproduce the problem to see where the exact reason for this
    inconsistency lies.

    The way I see it the SpatialElementGeometryCalculator hasn''t matured enough yet
    for application in real-life. In the company where I work right now we use gbXML
    for geometry in heat load calculation, because of the ability to check for inconsistencies
    when exporting the gbXML.

    I hope this helped. If you''ve got more questions, or want me to take a look at
    your project, feel free to contact me.


    greets, Jasper'
