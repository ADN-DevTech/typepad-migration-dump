  body: "Dear Jeremy Tammik\nthank you so much \nbut i still have that message :(\
    \ \n\n i used  projection function to project points of the curve onto active\

    \nconsidering ViewDirection is the same as view plane normal :\n\nstartPoint =\
    \ ProjectPointOntoPlane(startPoint,view.ViewDirection);\n\ni still getting this\
    \ bad message ): in some views while it's working in other views\nwould you help\
    \ me in that please?\nthank you"
