  body: "Hello Jeremy,\n\nI have been fiddling with C# programming lately because\
    \ of my interest in Revit API.\n\nAnd having a background in C-style language,\
    \ I managed to play with the examples that comes with the SDK and come up with\
    \ a working addin for my company use.\n\nPersonally, I know very well the value\
    \ this brings to my company that's why I want to present this to my boss. \n\n\
    But the thing is, I lack the relevant materials that will supplement my presentation.\
    \ \n\nSo if its not too much to ask, can you give me a couple of relevant links\
    \ or perhaps point me to the right resources for the positive outcome that revit\
    \ api brings to a company implementing Revit customization.\n\nany data or graphs\
    \ or perhaps surveys for things like company success stories because they start\
    \ to customize revit and increase in ROI because of Revit customization... things\
    \ like that if theres any would greatly help the success of in my upcoming presentation\
    \ which will eventually lead for my company to sponsor my entry to ADN (hopefully).\n\
    \ncheers, Ricky"

  body: "Dear Ricky,\n\nThere is an entire blog dedicated entirely to that subject:\
    \ \n\n<a href=\"http://bimapps.typepad.com\">http://bimapps.typepad.com</a>\n\n\
    If you need something more concise and compelling than what you find there already,\
    \ I would suggest that you submit that request as a comment on that blog.\n\n\
    As far as I can tell, one main intention of BIM Apps is to answer exactly this\
    \ request.\n\nI hope that helps.\n\nGood luck with your add-in development and\
    \ especially your company politics  :-)\n\nCheers, Jeremy\n-----"
