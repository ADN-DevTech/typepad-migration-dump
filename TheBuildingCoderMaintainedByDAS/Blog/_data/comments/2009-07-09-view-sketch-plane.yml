    Thanks your advics, it is pretty useful for me. I can generate a model line. Now
    I have another question, how to delete the model line I just generated. Thanks.
    Have a great summer.'

  body: "Dear Owen,\n\nI am very glad that helped. To delete a model line, or any\
    \ other Revit element for that matter, you can use the Document.Delete method.\
    \ Look at the Revit API help file RevitAPI.chm for more information on this, including\
    \ example code. \n\nThese and similar questions can also be answered by going\
    \ through the getting started material listed in \n\n<a href=\"http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2009/04/getting-started-with-the-revit-2009-api.html\"\
