  body: 'Jeremy,



    Can you recommend a consultant in the Los Angeles area that understands the basics
    of the API? I would really like to work with someone for a day or two. Again,
    I''m learning C# programming and I feel adding source code and code regions are
    probably pretty easy to do once I gain a better understanding of the basics.



    Thanks again,




    Vincent'

    The short answer is no, sorry. I''m in Switzerland, in Europe. Some of the people
    I talk with may or may not be in your area, but I really don''t know. You might
    be able to find someone in the ADN member database


    <a href="http://www.autodesk.com/partnerproducts">http://www.autodesk.com/partnerproducts</a>


    Or you might post a query to the Revit API discussion group


    <a href="http://discussion.autodesk.com">http://discussion.autodesk.com</a> >
    Revit Architecture > Revit API


    Or to AUGI, either in a specific forum e.g. under Revit:


    <a href="http://forums.augi.com/forumdisplay.php?f=93">http://forums.augi.com/forumdisplay.php?f=93</a>


    Or possibly searching for Los Angeles or something.


    Good luck!


    Cheers, Jeremy.'
