  body: 'Hi Jeremy,


    As this is an old post I wanted to check whether any element selection events
    have been added to the Revit 2014 api? I can''t see any obvious ones myself, so
    is this still the best method to use?


    Thanks,


    Neil Sutton'

  body: "Hi Jeremy,\n\nI have downloaded this zipfile, en tried to use this sample\
    \ in Revit 2014. I have added the Revit 2014 API references, changed the target\
    \ network to .NET 4, and I was able to build succesfully. When I open revit and\
    \ open a project, the SelectionWatcher ribbon panel appears. I have detached it\
    \ from the ribbon as described in the post. However, the selectionwatcher does\
    \ not respond to any selection changes. Furthermore, it doesn't display anything\
    \ at all (not even the text \"no rooms selected\".\n\nAre you aware of API changes\
    \ (between 2011 and 2014) that may cause this sample no longer to work? \n\nThanks,\n\
    \nJesse Mom"
