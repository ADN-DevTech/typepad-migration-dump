    First of all thanks a lot for writing this fantastic blog ! it is just a wonderful
    place to find answers and pieces of code for people who start developing with
    the Revit API.


    I''m writing a command that automatically generates schedules then places them
    on sheets (3 schedules by sheet). My trouble is it seems impossible to change
    the font size within schedules, so the 3 schedules take too much place for the
    sheet (I am forced to use a specific titleblock - A3 format).

    I see in Steven Mycynek''s PPT that shedules "appearance" is not changeable today...
    would you know a workaround ?

    Or must I have to create 3 "template schedules" (one by element category) with
    the good font size, then make duplicates ?


    Thanks in advance for your help !

    Thank you for your appreciation!


    It is indeed currently not possible to set the font for individual schedule cells.
    Sorry about that. We are working on it. Revit 2013 provided the first release
    of the schedule API, and cell formatting would be a pretty obvious next step,
    as you noticed.


    Yes, a workaround using template schedules sounds like a good idea. Good luck!


    Cheers, Jeremy.
