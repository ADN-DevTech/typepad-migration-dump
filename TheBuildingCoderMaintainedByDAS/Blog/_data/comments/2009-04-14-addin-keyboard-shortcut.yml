  body: Hey I have been looking at these samples and tech tips over the past few months
    prior to the Revit 2010 release. It seems like there is a major road block for
    those of us that are looking to create additional functionality to Revit. It would
    be really nice if someday you had an example of how to pick a point in Revit.
    Or am I the only person trying to do so :(

  body: 'Dear Greg,


    Thank you for your query, which I completely understand and support. I brought
    your comment as well as another one in a similar vein by Jim Massengale to the
    development team''s attention, so they are highly aware of this issue as well.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: Would it be possible to create an API that would be able to save DOWN Revit
    files?

  body: 'Dear Darick,


    When you say ''save down'', am I correct in assuming that you mean save a file
    back to a previous Revit file version? Nope, there is no such support in the API,
    and if there were, it would probably be made available in the product first.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    \ be possible to turn it on, since you have to choose the plan, but I guess it\
    \ is possibile to do it for none.\n\nis there a line we can put in the txt file?\n\
    \nlike:\n\"VU\"\tribbon:\"View-Graphics-View Properties-Underlay-None\"  ?\n\n\
