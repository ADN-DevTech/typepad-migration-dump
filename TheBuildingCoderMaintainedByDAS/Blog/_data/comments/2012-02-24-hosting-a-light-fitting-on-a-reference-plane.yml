  body: 'Ok, this is a fascinating article and answered part of my latest quandry.  As
    far as the next part, thank you to Simon for all the research!  Based on this,
    can anyone rationalize the meaning of direction vector as used in NewFamilyInstance(reference,
    xyz location, xyz direction, familySymbol)?  I found that by using a direction
    of (-1,0,0) the placement side flipped. (same effect Simon found where drawing
    the refplane the opposite way caused the placement side to flip)

    It appears that direction is the orientation of the family in the placement plane
    but it doesn''t suggest why the direction of drawing the refplane makes a difference
    unless it is relative to the plane normal.  e.g., any angle -90 to 90 is on same
    side as normal, any angle 91 to 270 is placed on side opposite to normal?'

  body: 'Hi Ken,


    My standard evasive answer to these kind of issues: understand it from the user
    interface point of view first.


    In Revit, the UI philosophy often helps a lot to clarify the API behaviour.


    So, have you asked a manual content creation expert, an application engineer?


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    Here is a discussion of this very topic:


    <a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2012/09/updating-properties-and-announcing-revit-lt.html">http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2012/09/updating-properties-and-announcing-revit-lt.html</a>


    Note that it does not work reliably, though, as some of the comments explain.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: 'Dear Bart,


    Sorry for not replying earlier.


    This is probably an error in one of your arguments.


    The Revit API improves error checking release by release, so erroneous input argument
    that went unnoticed in previous versions may throw and exception later.


    Very probably the problem is exactly what the error message says: the reference
    direction is parallel to the face normal at the insertion point.


    You probably need to understand that and fix it.


    I hope this helps.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    on this.


    bubbleEnd = new xyz(5, 0, 0);

    freeEnd = new xyz(-5, 0, 0);

    cutVec = new xyz(0, 0, 1);


    The reference plane created from these points and vector has a normal of (0, -1,
    0) and a direction of (1, 0, 0).  It''s length runs horizontal when on a floor
    plan view and it''s height is the cutVec or the global Z.  In 2012 version, when
    I set the reference direction to 1 or -1 unit vector for the X or Z value it will
    work.  But in 2013 and 2014 I tried all the possible reference directions and
    still get the exception the ref dir is parallel.  Shouldn''t one of them work?!  It
    appears to be the same issue Mona replied with.  None of the vectors work.'

    The best thing to do for you will be to submit a reproducible case for us to explore,
    and the easiest place to do that is in the Revit API discussion forum:
