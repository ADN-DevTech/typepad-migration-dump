    where from could I get the ids of path reinforcement parameters such as : "Primary
    Bar - Start Hook Type " :None

    and Face :("Exterior" and "Interior")


    for example : i want to change "face" of Path Reinforcement Object by code to
    make it "Exterior" insted of  "Interior" where could i find Exterior parameter
    ID?

    thanks you'

  body: "Dear Basil,\n\nAs so often when exploring how to automate things in Revit,\
    \ you will probably need to explore some of this for yourself interactively. Create\
    \ a sample model and toggle the features you are interested in on and off manually\
    \ through the user interface. At the same time, check what parameters are affected\
    \ by analysing the model using RevitLookup. That should provide all the answers\
    \ you need.\n\nI did notice that the Revit Structure 2011 API introduced a new\
    \ NewRebarHookType method:\n\n<a href=\"http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2010/05/the-revit-structure-2011-api.html\"\
    >http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2010/05/the-revit-structure-2011-api.html</a>\n\
    \nI also once had a conversation on setting the rebar end hook parameters using\
    \ \nBuiltInParameter.REBAR_ELEM_HOOK_START_TYPE and BuiltInParameter.REBAR_ELEM_HOOK_END_TYPE.\
    \ If you set them to new ElementId( -1 ), you can simulate setting them to End\
    \ Hook “None”. Here is the code we looked at back then:\n\ntransaction.Start(\
    \ \"Turn Off End Hook 1\" );\nParameter hookStartParam = rebar.get_Parameter(\
    \ \n  BuiltInParameter.REBAR_ELEM_HOOK_START_TYPE );\n\nElementId oldId = hookStartParam.AsElementId();\n\
    hookStartParam.Set( new ElementId( -1 ) );\ntransaction.Commit();\n\ntransaction.Start(\
    \ \"Turn Off End Hook 2\" );\nParameter hookEndParam = rebar.get_Parameter( \n\
    \  BuiltInParameter.REBAR_ELEM_HOOK_END_TYPE );\n\nElementId oldId = hookEndParam.AsElementId();\n\
    \nhookEndParam.Set( new ElementId( -1 ) );\ntransaction.Commit();\n\nI hope this\
    \ helps.\n\nCheers, Jeremy."

  body: 'Hi Jeremy

    When I create a new moment connection type.(for example new symbol for RBS Moment
    Frame) a new StructuralConnectionType Id is generated randomly by Revit.(something
    like 3975667)

    Are there anyway to make the Id state the same?

    Thanks'

    The StructuralConnectionType element id is probably not generated randomly.


    Instead, I imagine that Revit is generating a new StructuralConnectionType element
    for you, and that is its element id.


    You can check this by using the element lister:


    <a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2014/09/debugging-and-maintaining-the-image-relationship.html#2">http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2014/09/debugging-and-maintaining-the-image-relationship.html#2</a>


    You can also simply snoop the current database in RevitLookup and manually check
    whether a new StructuralConnectionType element has been added.


    If the newly generated StructuralConnectionType element is identical to another
    StructuralConnectionType element that you already have in your project and would
    like to reuse, you can probably do so through the following steps:


    1. Make a note of the newly generated element id X.


    2. Determine the element id Y of the StructuralConnectionType that you would like
    to reuse for your new moment connection type Z.


    3. Assign Y to Z, e.g. using the Element.ChangeTypeId method.


    4. Delete X, e.g. using the Document.Delete method.


    I hope this helps.


    Please let us know how you end up solving this.


    Thank you!


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: "Thanks for your reply Jeremy\nI think I was thinking in a wrong direction\
    \ when I was asking for help.\nActually I’m trying to write a code to assign Start/End\
    \ Connection. To do this I need to \nset new ElementID to the build in parameter.\
    \ In this case a different ElementID mapping can be problematic. But  I just found\
    \ out there is no need to make the ElementID state the same. My solution is to\
    \ retrieve the ElementID from the name of the Connection Type. \n\n//Get Parameter:\n\
    BuiltInParameter.STRUCT_CONNECTION_BEAM_START\n\n//filter by the StructuralConnectionType\
    \ class\nforeach (Element ConnType in new FilteredElementCollector(doc)\n .OfClass(typeof(StructuralConnectionType))\n\
    \  .Cast<StructuralConnectionType>()\n  .Where( m => m.Name.Equals(\"Moment Frame\
    \ RBS\")))\n\n  // Get ElementID and Convert to integer: \n   string NewId = ConnType.Id.ToString();\n\
    \   int idInt = Convert.ToInt32(NewId);\n    p.Set(new ElementId(idInt));\n  \
    \               \nThe key is to make sure the name is always the same for every\
    \ project. \nso now what I planing to do is to write a code to create the new\
    \ Structural Connection Types instead of make them in the Structural Setting Panel\
    \ manually. But somehow I got stuck on the StructuralConnectionType.Create Method.\
    \ I’m not able to find any code snippets yet.\nany suggestion for my solution?\
    \ \n\nBTW I just replaced my temporary username Locost7 to Sarkate which match\
    \ the one I use in the  official Autodesk API forum.\n\nThanks \n-----"
