  body: "Sorry to write you here, but you seems to be one that Autodesk listen to,\
    \ and the fail I have found should have been fixed before release of version 2013,\
    \ or at least before release of UR1\n\nI have found what for me is a critical\
    \ failure in Revit 2013 I don’t know how to fix, and I doubt that it can be fixed\
    \ without having Autodesk programmers to do something.\n\nI am very glad for the\
    \ new thermal options in materials, and that we now can calculate convective loss\
    \ that way.\n\nBUT the hardcoded parameters are named:\nHeat Transfer Coefficient\
    \ (U)\nThermal Resistance (R)\n\nBoth parameters are named with parentheses, and\
    \ that results in failures when I try to use them in formulas!\n\nFormula for\
    \ Convective Heat Transfer is:\nArea * Heat Transfer Coefficient * (Dim. Inside\
    \ Temperature - Dim. Outside Temperature)\n\nBut you can’t do it with the build\
    \ in, because it uses parentheses in parameter name.\nArea * Heat Transfer Coefficient\
    \ (U) * (Dim. Inside Temperature - Dim. Outside Temperature)\n\nI haven’t found\
    \ out how to make Revit accept “Heat Transfer Coefficient (U)”, so either the\
    \ programmers have to rename build-in parameters without using parentheses, or\
    \ they have to make it possible to use quote marks as surrounding to text.\n\n\
    Could you somehow make the programmers at Autodesk realize that this is a rather\
    \ big problem for implementing thermal use in materials, if we can’t reuse those\
    \ data?\n\nKind regards \nErik Falck Jørgensen, Denmark"
