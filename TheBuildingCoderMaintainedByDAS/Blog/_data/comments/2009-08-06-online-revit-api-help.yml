    Nice to hear that you are working on the Revit MEP sample.


    Regarding debugging, I would suggest that you follow the steps described in the
    developer guide chapter 2 walkthroughs. They include a description of how to set
    up a Visual Studio project to create, compile, run and debug a Revit add-in. You
    can also look at the DevTV recordings:

    To extract data and export it to Excel, you can look at several of the Revit SDK
    samples. Simply search globally for the string ''Excel'' in the entire SDKSamples2011.sln
    solution.


    Cheers, Jeremy.
