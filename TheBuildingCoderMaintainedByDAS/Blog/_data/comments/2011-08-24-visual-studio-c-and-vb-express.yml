  body: 'Jeremy: This is great. Thanks!


    When I use the template, C# 2010 Express for some reason thinks that Revit is
    installed in "Program Files (x86)" rather than where it''s actually installed,
    "Program Files". Therefore the RevitAPI and RevitAPIUI references are not found.
    That''s easy enough to fix but then the debugger doesn''t launch Revit; I get
    an EXE not found message. Any idea how I can fix this?


    Thanks,


    Tim'

    Yes, I am enthusiastic as well.


    I guess it is taking the installation directory from some built-in OS variable
    or something.


    You can always edit the templates yourself to use a fixed location that suits
    you instead.


    Simply unzip them, edit, and zip them up again.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    I have VS 2010 Express only - I opened the template to cvhange the Debug program
    path (I have Revit 64bit) but it seems you cannot change this settings in the
    Express version. Do you any other solutions other than having VS Full Edition?'

    Yes, I am pretty sure that you can set up VS 2010 Express for debugging on 64
    bits as well.


    You probably just have to edit the *proj XML file manually in a text editor, e.g.
    Notepad.


    Look at Kean''s blog for more details:
