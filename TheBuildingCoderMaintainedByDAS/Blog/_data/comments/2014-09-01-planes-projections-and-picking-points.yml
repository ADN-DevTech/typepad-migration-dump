  body: 'Dear Kon,


    Your approach of inserting elements with known coordinates sounds very promising
    to me.


    I am not familiar with the transformations applied to export the model to Navisworks
    specifically.


    However, in general, the Revit project location defines a transformation from
    the local Revit document model space to world coordinates.


    <a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2010/01/project-location.html">http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2010/01/project-location.html</a>


    These are absolute and real earth coordinates.


    I would assume that Navisworks would respect these.


    Therefore, I would suggest that you do a couple of things:


    1. Set up a Revit model with a trivial project location, if that is possible at
    all. That might enable you to export the Revit coordinates to Navisworks directly
    with no transformation. That should help understand the rest.


    2. Determine the transformation to apply to go from Revit model to real world
    earth coordinates and vice versa.


    I believe the setout point add-in implements all you need for that:

    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    Thanks for your hints - they came in handy...

    ..In the end, it actually *was* the coordinates from Revit, but I forgot that
    Revit internally is imperial and the files from Navisworks were exported in metric.
    So, I got it to work by converting to imperial, as well as playing around with
    the Project Location transformation to get the right rotation and ''offset''.


    Regards,

    Kon.'
