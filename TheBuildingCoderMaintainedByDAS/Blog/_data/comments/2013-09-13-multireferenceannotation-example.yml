  body: 'Hi,


    I have problem with " GetElements<Element>(...)". I cannot access that method.
    How I can get it?


    Using Revit 2015 Api.

  body: 'Dear RNowak,


    Looking at the code above, I would say that the templated GetElements method being
    used above by Miguel Angel is his personal implementation.


    You can replace it by a call to the standard Revit API Document.GetElement method
    or, for more complex uses, a filtered element collector.


    Cheers, Jeremy.
