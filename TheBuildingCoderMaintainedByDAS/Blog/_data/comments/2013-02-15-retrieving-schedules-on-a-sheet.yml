  body: 'Dear Jeremy,


    How would you go about retrieving only the materials that are scheduled in a material
    takeoff schedule?

    As you said above, inserting the ViewScheduleId as a filter in an elementscollector,
    in case of a material takeoff, retrieves the scheduled elements but also the entire
    material library..

    This is annoying as I would like to make unique records of ''ElementId + MaterialId''
    for each entry in each material takeoff in the project, to check if the Revit
    user hasn''t created duplicate measurements. This happens and can be quite a costly
    error.


    Thanks in advance for any help or direction,


    Kind regards,


    Paulus'

  body: 'I got it to work, but it is quite ugly code, making use of some collectors
    and filters (if anyone cares to see it, be my guest =).


    It would be a lot easier and save a lot of trouble if the API would be reprogrammed
    to only include the scheduled materials instead of the entire library.


    There''s no point in having the entire material library as the result of a schedulefilter,
    as you can get all materials simply by applying an OffCategory filter to a collector.


    Kind regards,


    Paulus'

  body: 'Dear Paulus,


    Thank you for letting us know.


    Yes indeed, I would love to take a look.


    Maybe we can find some room for improvement and possibly even simplification.


    Can you share it as a gist or something?
