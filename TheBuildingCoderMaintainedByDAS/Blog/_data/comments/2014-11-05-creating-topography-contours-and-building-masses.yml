  body: 'Hi Jeremy,


    Once again thank you for providing great help, without which we couldn''t have
    developed this application. Here is a video demonstration of the final version
    of the application:

    I sped up the process in the video to make the demonstration short.


    I would be more than happy to answer questions related to the development of the
    application.


    Best wishes,

    Saied.'

  body: 'Dear Saied,


    Thank you very much for your appreciation and the cool video.


    I embedded it inline within the main blog post text above.


    Would you like to compare your current source code with the GitHub version?


    Maybe fork it and create a pull request to merge the differences?


    Are you working on Revit 2015 by now?


    Thank you!


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    \ Research Group, unfortunately I do not have the authority to publish the source\
    \ code. However, the main part of the idea is already published in this post.\
    \ \n\nThe final application is highly mixed with classes and delegates that are\
    \ developed for the interface design. Also, it uses ESRI API libraries to read\
    \ the contents of GIS Shapefiles. \n\nIt would be a pleasure for me to help the\
    \ readers of this blog with questions that they may have.\n\nI am currently working\
    \ with Revit 2015 API libraries; however, I did not yet get the chance of updating\
    \ the \"GIStoBIM\" application. It needs to be done though!\n\nCheers,\nSaied."

    Thank you very much for your update, very friendly offer help to others, and explanation,
    which I totally understand.


    The migration to Revit 2015 was pretty trivial, as you can see by looking at the
    diffs on GitHub:
