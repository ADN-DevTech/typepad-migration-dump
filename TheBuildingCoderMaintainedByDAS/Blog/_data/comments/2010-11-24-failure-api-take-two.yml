  body: 'While i believe the online check in process in some cases needs to be more
    specific ie cases where problem is passengers information/ esta it is probably
    more efficient for ba to have a general message saying check in unavailable the
    rest of the time. I work for ba call centre and there are so many reasons why
    it may be unavailable like oversold flts, random security checks  simply not available
    in thst flt etc.
