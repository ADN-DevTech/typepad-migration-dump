  body: 'Hi, Jeremy.

    Thanks for posting.

    Some remarks.

    To get access to the StreamInfo class you need reference WindowsBase.dll assembly.


    At the result console you see many question symbols because one part of BasicFileInfo
    encoded in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode">Unicode</a> and another
    part encoded in BigEndianUnicode (sorry, I could find the link quickly:)).

    You can see another part of BasicFileInfo by following code

    var rawString = System.Text.Encoding.<b>BigEndianUnicode</b>.GetString(rawData);


    Have a nice day,

    Victor.'

  body: 'Dear Victor,


    Thank you for the update and important additional info.


    How do I know which part is which? Is it determined by length, or what?


    I would like to add the big-endian decoding to my sample code right away.


    Thank you!


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: 'Hi Jeremy, hi Victor,


    think of a RVT file that was saved by a Revit 2013.

    If a plug-in (which runs inside an old Revit 2012) tries to open the file, it
    will fail.


    Revit files cannot be opened by older Revits.


    Your approach can help to avoid that situation.


    May be relevant when developing multi-version apps.



    Cheers,

    Rudolf'

    What could be wrong there? Is there any other way to get the wall area brutto?

  body: "Hi, Jeremy.\nActually, I didn't know which part is which.\nBut I've made\
    \ a little investigation of BasicFileInfo structure. It seems I was wrong with\
    \ BigEndianUnicode\n\nAs I understand BasicFileInfo stream is the binary format\
    \ of some structure. I tried to understand with this structure and came to the\
    \ following conclusion.\n\n1. First 4 bytes - unknown Int32 value\n2. Next 4 bytes\
    \ - unknown Int32 value\n3. Next 2 bytes - unknown Int16 value\n4. Next 4 bytes\
    \ - Int32 value is the length of following string representing local path of the\
    \ file\n5. Local path of the file in Unicode\n6. Next 4 bytes - Int32 value is\
    \ the length of following string representing Revit version\n7. Revit Version\
    \ as Unicode string\n8. Next 4 bytes - Int32 value is the length of following\
    \ string representing path of the central file\n9. PAth of the central file\n\
    10. Next 5 bytes - Unknown for me (or Int32 + 1 byte)\n11. Next 4 bytes - Int32\
    \ value is the length of following string representing path of the central model\
    \ identity\n12. the central model identity\n13. Next 4 bytes - Int32 value is\
    \ the length of following string representing path of the locale when saved\n\
    14. String. Locale when save\n15. next 2 bytes - 0d 0a is \\r\\n\n16. All remaining\
    \ bytes without two last bytes - Unicode string which represent all previous info\
    \ as whole string. \n17. The last two bytes - 0d 0a is \\r\\n\n\nI wrote a simple\
    \ code to extract the data. It is just a sample :). <a href=\"http://pastebin.com/FUBcmSRx\"\
    >Updated code</a>\n\nIt is for 2013 Revit file. As I can suggest, In the revit\
    \ 2012 file there is no string which represents all information (step 15-17).\n\
    \nThe unknown values perhaps represent IsCentral, IsCreatedLocal, IsInProgress,\
    \ IsLocal, IsWorkshared, Open workset default, project spark file properties.\n\
    \nI think I cannot say you more information.\n\nRegards, \nVictor"

  body: 'Jeremy,

    What is the purpose of the various properties in the BasicFileInfo class such
    as "Username" and "IsWorkshared" if you don''t use them in the code?  I tried
    to use the class similarly to the TransmissionData class but get an error.  Thanks.
