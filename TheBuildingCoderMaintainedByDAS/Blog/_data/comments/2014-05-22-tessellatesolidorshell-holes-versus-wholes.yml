  body: Perhaps the issue could be solved by rounding *every* ordinate to (say) 1mm,
    and use the dictionary method with the rounded values?

  body: 'Dear Matt,


    Yes, exactly, it absolutely could.


    Thank you very much for the suggestion!


    That is basically what I do in the OBJ exporter.


    I avoid the costly conversion to strings for the dictionary keys, though, by two
    alternative means:


    1. Using XYZ real number coordinates and the XyzEqualityComparer in the the VertexLookupXyz.


    2. Even more efficiently: converting the XYZ real number coordinates to integer
    based millimetres, after which I can use standard integer equality comparison.


    What you suggest would in principle achieve the same thing.


    Cheers, Jeremy.
