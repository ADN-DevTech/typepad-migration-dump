  body: Hi Jeremy, i'm trying to modify a model in-place family, a generic model (basically,
    i want to mimic the "edit in place" functionality of revit with the api) . The
    document.editfamily method doesn't work in this case and so far i haven't seen
    any method that could do the job. Could you help me please on this? Best Regards.

    I am sorry to say that there is currently no way to programmatically create or
    manipulate in-place families.


    The workaround it to use standard families instead, e.g. generic models or something,
    e.g. like for the building masses in today''s post:
