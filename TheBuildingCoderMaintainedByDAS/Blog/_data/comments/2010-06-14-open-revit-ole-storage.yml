  body: Has anyone taken this a step further to actually pull out information about
    the drawing elements inside the Revit file?  Primarily I'd like to look for a
    particular family inside a file and pull out a quanitity for use elsewhere.

  body: 'Dear Mike,


    I do not believe that is possible. The accessible data only includes metadata
    of the kind listed above, and all the model data is contained in one single large
    stream the internal of which are not accessible.


    You could do what you wish from within a Revit add-in, either analysing a file
    opened by the user in the GUI or any other Revit file opened invisibly in the
    background via the API.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: For 2012, it looks like a minor change needs to be made.  In BasicFileInfo.cs,
    in ParseDetailInfo() the string "CENTRALFILEPATH" needs to be changed to "CENTRALMODELPATH".

    Wow, great, thank you for the important and useful info!


    Do you have an updated version to share with us?


    I could simply add it to the post above, or create a new post for the 2012 version,
    if you think that is worthwhile...


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: 'Jeremy,


    Sorry for the late response but I got pulled off onto something else again.  I
    have it opening the file, giving me the preview image and file name and that’s
    were it stops.  I don’t get the build info, central file info, etc.  I made the
    following changes and I am sure I am just missing something simple.


    Added System.Xaml for the Markup.IUriContext since I am working with .NET 4.0


    Added Revit to ProductType.cs (I may have this wrong)

    Added the associated if line to BasicFileInfo.cs'

  body: Also to note is that when I step through the app line by line I do see it
    pull the unicodeData but when it starts to break it apart is were it appears to
    be breaking down.

    Now it is my turn to apologise for the delay in replying.


    Congratulations on the progress.


    Have you completed it yet, or are you still stuck somewhere?


    I will gladly publish the updated version.


    Cheers, Jeremy.
