    Thank you for all your help in the past two years:)


    I am still having problems with enabling custom command buttons. I have implemented
    Availability Class and done as you said here (I have also inserted AvailabilityClassName
    tag in *.addin file). Command Buttons are enabled, as is External Tools button,
    but only on app start up. It goes back to disabled state as soon as I open some
    project.


    Thanks again, wish you all the best.'

    Thank you very much for your appreciation, I am ever so glad I was able to help
    in the past.


    Congratulations on solving your current problem!


    I actually tried to answer to your previous comment, but something went wrong
    with the system here, and it did not show up.


    Here is what I wanted to say:


    There are only two possibilities: there is something wrong with your availability
    class implementation and behaviour, or you are running in some state which disables
    all external commands:


    <a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2009/06/rfa-version-grey-commands-family-context-and-rdb-link.html#2">http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2009/06/rfa-version-grey-commands-family-context-and-rdb-link.html#2</a>


    I would try removing the availability class and all references to it, and see
    whether the buttons are displayed normally again then.


    Anyway, now you resolved it, and the comments are working again as well.


    Oh, and I also tried to email you an answer, but was told that "Delivery has failed
    to these recipients or groups..."  Tant pis.  :-)


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    I am having a difficult time finding any documentation regarding availability
    of a textbox during a zero document state. Every time my textbox event is fired
    it seems like the event is getting the active document or document (which none
    are open). In my textbox event and subsequent functions there are no calls to
    acquire the UI. Where am I going wrong?

    Thank you, interesting issue. Never heard of it before.


    Could you please submit an ADN DevHelp Online case for that and supply a sample
    add-in demonstrating the problem, preferably a complete Visual Studio solution
    so that we can compile, install and reproduce the problem our end with one single
    click?


    Then we can research the issue and forward to the development team if need be.
    Thank you!


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    Does this only work for buttons on the Add-Ins tab?  I can''t seem to make it
    work for my own tab.  After I load Revit 2013 and click on my tab I get "Revit
    cannot run availability command "name i gave".  Contact the provider..."

    In the detail section it says "System.TypeLoadException while creating instance
    of ''name'' in ''my dll path.''  Thanks.'

    I would expect the availability class to work in the same manner for all buttons.

    I figured out the problem.  I didn''t realize the importance of the string name
    "ZeroDocPanel.Availability".  After I input my app''s namespace plus .Availability,
    it worked.  Thanks again.'
