    I just found a workaround for creating walls with the location line set to "Finish
    Face" (for exemple) on creation. I just first create a wall two times thicker,
    change the location line position, and finaly change my wall type to its final
    thickness. I explain it more accuratly here : <a href="http://bim42.com/2014/02/09/modellingskirtingboards/">http://bim42.com/2014/02/09/modellingskirtingboards/</a>

  body: 'Dear Simon,


    Thank you very much for sharing your brilliant idea.


    The best solutions are always the simplest, and this is an absolutely perfect
    example of that.


    Thank you also for sharing your Revit room finishing and skirting board modelling
    application for free on the Autodesk Exchange:


    <a href="http://apps.exchange.autodesk.com/RVT/en/Detail/Index?id=appstore.exchange.autodesk.com%3aroomfinishing_windows32and64%3aen">http://apps.exchange.autodesk.com/RVT/en/Detail/Index?id=appstore.exchange.autodesk.com%3aroomfinishing_windows32and64%3aen</a>


    I am looking forward to seeing the code on GitHub.


    Congratulations on all of these good steps!


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    I like your solution so much that I promoted it to a proper blog post of its own:
