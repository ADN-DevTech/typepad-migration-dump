  body: 'Hi Jeremy,


    there are still many other interesting topics in the 2012 API which haven''t found
    their way to your blog yet.


    I would like to see more about the new Utils methods.


    If you seach for "*utils" in the 2011 RevitAPI.chm, there are 43 results; in 2012,
    you''ll find 265 entries.

    There are much static classes whose names end with "-Utils", e.g. PlumbingUtils,
    WallUtils, FamilyUtils, HostObjectUtils, OptionalFunctionalityUtils...


    Most of them provide useful methods which someone should know before trying to
    implement their functionality on his own, which would be unnecessary.


    Bye,

    Rudolf'

  body: 'Hi Jeremy,


    I didn''t mean that I needed more information than I already can get from the
    RevitAPI.chm.

    I think the API documentation is sufficient.


    But for the readers of your blog, it could be useful if the different Utils methods
    would be displayed next to each other, in a table, as an additional documentation,
    so to speak.

    A little overview, as you said.


    Unfortunately, I don''t have time for doing that.

  body: 'Dear Rudolf,


    Great idea, I fully agree. Most of those classes I have not explored yet either.
    I would love to do so. We are in the same boat timewise, though. Any takers?


    Do you have any bright ideas on how to extract the data for such a table?


    When I search for ''utils'' in the Revit 2012 API help file, I see 500 results
    listed, and no way to copy an overview of them to a text file or any other destination
    outside the help window.


    Maybe it would be more efficient and less work to use Reflection instead and extract
    the data directly from the Revit namespaces in the API assemblies?


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: 'Dear Rudolf,


    I am very glad that you find the API documentation sufficient, that is really
    good news!


    I like you suggestions a lot. Somehow I suspect that Kean sold his soul and now
    has a couple of extra hours per day to play with Kinect, and another couple to
    play with F#. I''m still considering something similar, but have not taken the
    plunge yet. Until I do so, I don''t really feel like wading through 500 hits in
    the API documentation and manually extracting information from them.


    By the way, the Revit API already includes a namespace named Autodesk.Revit.Utility,
    providing functionality related to material assets, I believe.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: 'Hi Jeremy,


    yes, I know that there is already a namespace named "Utility", but as you said,
    it refers more to materials but it is not a namespace for common utilities.


    Talking about Kean, there is another point I want to say.

    What about porting his AutoCAD sample code to Revit ?


    There is a loose series about geometrical phenomenons, for example, about fractals
    or the Apollonian gasket.


    I think that AcDBLine is equivalent to ModelLine (or DetailLine), every AcGeSomething
    has a counterpart in the Revit geometry classes.

    As for creating solids, we are forced to use the family context (or the AVF),
    but nearly everything could also be performed in Revit.


    To be honest, much of the AutoCAD stuff is just playing around, but you are not
    forbidden to have fun when coding ;-)


    What about this:

    Firstly, let Kean do all the AutoCAD work.

    Wait some time until he has finished the code and goes to bed.

    Then, when he is asleep, grab his code and adjust it to Revit environment.


    When he wakes up, he sees a new entry in YOUR blog, too.


    Perhaps he does''nt sleep at all (so he has more time for the Kinect stuff). In
    this case, he will prevent you from getting his code clandestinely.



    Best regards,

    Rudolf'

    I went thru so much hustle to recreate this functionality from scratch :(

    Yes, terrible, isn''t it? There is so much stuff in the Revit API that I have
    never heard or dreamed about. And obviously I cannot go searching for something
    if I have no idea that it exists. The same thing happens to me all the time, and
    I am continuously flabbergasted by new stuff that was in there all the time and
    I was unaware of. So you have my full sympathy  :-)


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: Jeremy, Yes it happens all the time. I usually try to think of it as a time
    spent towards practicing rather than wasted time - just to avoid to feel bad about
    the time wasted ;) I usually just have "abuse" the search text box on your blog
    ;)

    If I make and register a custom IPerformanceAdviserRule does Revit ever automatically
    run this rule? Or do I always have to manualy trigger it from PerformanceAdviser?
