  body: 'Jeremy,

    Will the actual release version of RevitAddInUtility.dll be added to the GAC -
    it is not for Beta 2. We built the sample exe and put it on the desktop of a user''s
    PC and it failed to work properly because it could not find the utility dll. So
    we either have to locate the Revit program folder or use a local copy of the utility
    dll - which seems to defeat the purpose somewhat.'

    Thank you for the great question.


    I like it so much I will use it as a starting point (or maybe rather as an ending
    point) for tomorrow''s post.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'
