  body: 'Hi Jeremy,

    A pleasure.

    You have done over 1000 posts now, so it''s not surprising you can''t remember
    all of them. Throw into that the unpublished support requests you handle, and
    you''ve got no chance!

    I just happened to be doing research on groups recently, so it was fresh in my
    mind.


    Have a good day. :)


    Matt'
