  body: "Hi Jeremy,\n\nIs it possible to obtain the element ID of a \"Room\" object\
    \ in a linked architectural model that a MEP \"Space\" object in a host model\
    \ has been associated. \n\nI would like to access more information about the room\
    \ than what is available (Project parameter added by architect applied to \"rooms\"\
    ).\n\nThanks"
