  body: 'Hi Jeremy,


    I had trouble with displaying Modify ribbon after I select elements from code.
    I found out, that if I use doc.BeginTransaction() and doc.EndTransaction() right
    after, it works perfectly.


    Now I had to reinstal Revit Architecture 2010 and the problem reappeared. I tried
    few different selection methods, but nothing helped. Is there an "update ribbon"
    method or something similar, that would solve the thing?'

    Nope, the Revit API does not provide any methods to updated the ribbon or refresh
    the user interface in any way, as far as I know. Revit seems to assume that it
    can take care of that internally. I have also not heard of any similar issues
    in the past. Is this all in Revit 2010? Have you tried it in 2011?


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    \ I am talking to a guru, I would like to ask you, if you know, what is going\
    \ on with new selection method. In 2010 for example it was:\nElementIterator ei\
    \ = _document.Elements;\nei.Reset();\nwhile (ei.MoveNext())\n{\n// do something\

    \nforeach (Element e in elements)\n{\ntry\n{\n   // do something - I need try-catch,\

  body: "Dear Jonz,\n\nIn principle you are completely right, but there is room for\
    \ improvement on two counts:\n\n1) You do not have to convert your collector to\
    \ an ICollection if you do not want to for other reasons. The collector itself\
    \ already provides an IEnumerator interface, so you can directly say 'foreach\
    \ Element e in collector'.\n\n2) If you are expecting some elements to have a\
    \ null category property, which is a sensible expectation and also was so in 2010,\
    \ then you should NOT, DEFINITELY NOT, use an expception to handle that case.\
    \ An exception is for handling exceptional cases, not an expected situation. Just\
    \ test whether the category is null instead. An exception is a hundred times more\
    \ expensive, both in time and other resources.\n\nSo you code might look like\
    \ this:\n\nFilteredElementCollector collector = new FilteredElementCollector(_document);\n\
    collector.WhereElementIsNotElementType();\n\nforeach( Element e in collector )\n\
    {\n  if( null != e.Category )\n  {\n    // do something\n  }\n}\n\nCheers, Jeremy."

  body: 'Dear Purnima,


    Your issue looks like a fundamental problem of understanding the structure of
    our own application.


    As far as I can tell, you have made m_CommandData a class member of your command
    class. The data grid view is presumably located in a different class, so it has
    different class members. If you want to access the document from the data grid
    view class, you will need to pass in that information somehow from the command
    class.


    I suggest learning more basic .NET technology and object oriented design principles
    before proceeding any further with this :-)

    You can try to call document Regenerate, or terminate a transaction.


    The latter is more expensive.

    Thank you for your appreciation. I am glad you find it useful.


    I can think of two possibilities off-hand. Not sure that they still work, though.


    1. Specify the Revit selection set, e.g. using the Selection.SetElementIds method.


    2. Not so elegant... add the elements you want highlighted to the ElementSet argument
    passed in to your external command Execute method, and return Result.Cancelled
    or Result.Failed. That causes them to be highlighted. This method is used by the
    south facing windows sample:

    I hope this helps.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    Only Revit can activate the property panel.


    That is actually obvious, once you think about it.


    However, if you can programmatically activate an element, then Revit may display
    its properties.


    In this case, since you are after type properties, you would have to set the element
    type as the active selected element.


    You can try to do that manually through the Manage > Select by ID, and programmatically
    using the Selection.SetElementIds method.


    I have heard that Revit sometimes does not update the property panel even when
    the selection has changed, though, so I cannot guarantee that will work.


    Please let us know how you get on.


    If you solve this, it may be worth a blog post.


    Thank you!


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    I have tried the "Selection.SetElementIds" method but it still doesn''t show the
