  body: 'Hi, Jeremy.

    <a href="https://bim360.autodesk.com/">BIM 360 Glue</a> is an interesting service.
    But as I know there is no public access to this service. Including ADN member.

    I wrote to Mikako Harada and he said ''we are still experimenting the best process
    to give an access to winder ADN accuminty''.

    So, there is no way to meet with this service.


    Regards,

    Victor.'

    True, in principle. As I mention above, the only thing you can do right now to
    access the API is buy a normal account access and ask that to be converted to
    a developer account.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    If I visit the SDK link [<a href="http://bim360.autodesk.com/api/doc/index.shtml]">http://bim360.autodesk.com/api/doc/index.shtml]</a>
    I don''t see a link to download the SDK?


    I then selected the Get Started link on the SDK page - still no download.


    I joined the ADN Open and still can''t see how i acquire the SDK and tools to
    get started.


    Any ideas?'

    We are currently in the pilot program. I just got started with the BIM 360 GLUE
    api. Is the SDK not available to download even for those in the Pilot program?
    If not, could you please let me know where and how I could access it?


    Cheers,

    Raj'
