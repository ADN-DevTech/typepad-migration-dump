    I was wondering if there is any way to calculate the volume of solids in nested
    families? Currently working on a project where I am using curtain panels (which
    has nested families in it) in a divided surface, since i am planning to make the
    panels out of poured concrete, I need to calculate the volume of each panel, but
    as I have nested the components of the panel, it becomes difficult to access the
    properties of the components/solids to get such information. I am not much familiar
    with accessing nested family parameters with API, hope you could pin point if
    there are any examples available.'

    Sure you can calculate the volumes of nested family instances. You can try to
    use the Element.GetMaterialVolume method. You can dig into the nested instance
    hierarchy and query its geometry as described in
