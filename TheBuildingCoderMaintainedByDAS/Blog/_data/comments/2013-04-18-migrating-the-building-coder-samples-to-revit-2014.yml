    In your buiding coder samples, there is a command for create a new project document.
    In my case, I would like to create a new project document from my own revit template.I
    managed to create new project document if revit template file is a separate file
    from dll. My problem is I want to embedded revit template file into Resource in
    IDE.'

    That sounds pretty cool.


    However, the only method available to you is the Application NewProjectDocument
    method taking a filename argument.


    So the only option is see for you is to extract your embedded resource to a temporary
    location and pass it a valid temporary filename.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: 'Hi Jeremy!


    I''m having some troubles installing your samples.

    First of all i am a nob in this Revit API, but trying to learn.


    I have already installed the revit Samples that come with the SDK, and followed
    your instructions regarding the include statement in the end of the RVTSamples.txt,
    and also changed the path within the BcSamples.txt to address my BuildingCoder.dll
    location. I build successfully in visual studio, but when i open Revit your samples
    don''t show up.

    Can you tell me what i am doing wrong?


    I also noted that the Revit Samples buttons aren''t all available, do you have
    any idea why?

  body: 'Dear Rui,


    I am glad hear you are learning the Revit API.


    Sorry to hear about your troubles, though.


    Before you try to install The Building Coder samples, you should be well acquainted
    with the standard Revit add-in installation process using the add-in manifest.


    Please work through the getting started materials to understand that:


    <a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/about-the-author.html#2">http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/about-the-author.html#2</a>


    Next, install the RvtSamples SDK sample and get that up and running.


    After that, enabling The Building Coder samples is a piece of cake:


    <a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2008/11/loading-the-building-coder-samples.html">http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2008/11/loading-the-building-coder-samples.html</a>


    It makes use of include files, which are defined using #include.


    All other occurrences of the hash character # are interpreted as comments, though.


    So ##include is just a comment, and therefore ignored.


    Good luck!


    Cheers, Jeremy.'
