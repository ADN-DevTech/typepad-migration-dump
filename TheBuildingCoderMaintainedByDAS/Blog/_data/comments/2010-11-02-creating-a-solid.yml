  body: 'Hi Jeremy,


    Is there a way to clone a solid?


    Currently we use the BooleanOperationsUtils.ExecuteBooleanOperation to union a
    solid with itself to implement this function.


    Do you have any other way or is this way effective?


    Thanks,

    Nicholas'

    Not that I am aware of. Your solution sounds like a pretty sensible way to go,
    in lack of any other obvious option.


    Cheers, Jeremy.
