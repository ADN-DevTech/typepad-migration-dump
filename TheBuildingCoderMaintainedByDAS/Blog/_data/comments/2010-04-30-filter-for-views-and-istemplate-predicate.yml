    \ view.\nBut, the following syntax takes lot of time : \n\nList ViewElements =\
    \ view.Elements.OfType().ToList(); \nOf this one (same) : \nElementSet elementSet\
    \ = view.Elements;\n\nIs it possible to get some specifical Elements like OST_RasterImages\
    \ in a specifical View?\n\nThx."

    Bad luck!

    \ API - checking for:\nif( !view.IsTemplate )\nseems to be not enough - you also\

  body: 'Dear Dima,


    Yes, absolutely. Thank you for pointing it out!


    Here is another situation requiring this check, since PickObject can cause issues
    when used on an internal view:

    One way to ensure that a view is valid for use in the Revit preview control is
    to check its CanBePrinted property:

    How can I duplicate a ViewTemplate using API?

    The following code returns False if v1 is ViewTemplate.

    v1.CanViewBeDuplicated(ViewDuplicateOption.Duplicate)


    Thx.'

    I am sorry to say that this may currently not be possible.


    All I know is that we have an open wish list item CF-1509 [API wish: create view
    template -- 09693106] for programmatic creation of a view template.


    Have you tried using the copy and paste API? How does that behave in this context?


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    Thank you very much for the help. It is possible by Using Copy Paste API.

    I have tried the following code successfully.


    <i>Dim elementIds As New List(Of ElementId)

    elementIds.Add(v.Id)

    copiedIds = ElementTransformUtils.CopyElements(ActiveDoc, elementIds, ActiveDoc,
    Transform.Identity, options)

    vNew = ActiveDoc.GetElement(copiedIds(0))

    vNew.Name = "New View Template"


    Cheers, Madhu Das.'

    Thank you very much for the update and confirmation that the copy and paste API
    can be used successfully to create a view template.


    That is great news!
