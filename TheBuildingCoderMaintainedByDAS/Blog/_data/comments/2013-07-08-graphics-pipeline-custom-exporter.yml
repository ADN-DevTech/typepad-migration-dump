    Yes, it is:

    If you wish to combine this with the above-mentioned custom exporter functionality,
    you can use a filtered element collector to populate a view and then run the custom
    exporter in that specific view.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: 'Hello,

    As we know the Revit uses the imperial feet (coordinates, lengths, ...).


    I assume this is true for the custom export too, all the coordinates in the OnPolymesh
    method are feet. What about the vertex UV-s? Are those values calculated based
    on this principle? Should I multiply them with 0.3048 to convert into metric system
    (meters)?

    Yes, you are perfectly correct.


    I would assume this to apply to UV coordinates as well.


    Do they have any relevant length, though, or are they just used to define a direction?


    Please try it out and let us know.


    Thank you!


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    It seems you should convert the UV values too but you should divide (not multiply
    as the coords) by 0.3048 (feet/meter factor).'

  body: I can't seem to get the collada exporter to work as it requires the active

    \ compiles ok, it saves the file, but no software that I have is able to read\
    \ the file, though I can read any other collada file I download from the net.\
    \ I'm actually not interested in exporting the textures. I'm rather interested\

    \ the file. Meaning the exterior of the wall ( which lets assume is bricks) would\
    \ be different than the interior ( lets assume it is dry wall). I can handle the\
    \ texturing in an external software, but with some software, for example Unity\
    \ gaming engine, the FBX produces a wall with no distinction between exterior\
    \ surface and interior surface. \nSo the question is this:\nis it possible, through\
    \ the custom exporter, to export a single wall as an FBX where the polygons/triangles\
    \ have different material assignment without any texture information. Any help\

    I use revit 2014 of rac_basic_sample_project drawing export the model geometry
    data and texture information when it came to the issue.

    1. Wall and sofa models'' location are not correct, some walls collapsed, sofa
    stacked together.

    2. Failed to get RPC model geometry and uv coordinates (such as trees, grass,
    glass)

    3. How to use transparent textures rendering? I got rac_basic_sample_project drawing
    roof colors and textures, but I was unable to render a red roof.

    Yes, indeed, writing a complete custom exporter with all the frills is not a trivial
    task.


    Here are some other discussion of the topic that may help resolve some of the
    issues:


    <a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/about-the-author.html#5.1">http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/about-the-author.html#5.1</a>


    Possibly, the vA3C exporter RvtVa3c is most completely developed and tested sample
    that I can offer you:


    <a href="https://github.com/va3c/RvtVa3c">https://github.com/va3c/RvtVa3c</a>


    You will have to put in more work to bring it to a really professional level,
    though.


    I hope this helps.


    Please let us know how you get on and what you end up with.


    Any enhancements you make to RvtVa3c will be much appreciated!


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: 'Dear jeremy,

    Thank you for your reply.Through your reply, I found the answer to the first two
    questions I raised.

    1. Wall and sofa models'' location are not correct, some walls collapsed, sofa
    stacked together.

    ---In the Custom Exporter interface,there are transforms,We need to use these
    transform to calculate the model scene coordinates.

    2.Failed to get RPC model geometry and uv coordinates (such as trees, grass, glass)

    ---My negligence, when I read the code you uploaded only to find RPC because copyright
    issues, only to provide Asset information.

    Now I can export the revit 2014 of rac_basic_sample_project drawing  model and
    render it, 80% of the data is correct.I can''t wait to get my model posted up
    with Revit, but I don''t find the buttons to upload the pictures.

    When I exported the model, I met three questions：

    1.The transformation of the model is incorrect, such as the column,railing.

    2.One column derives two Element, whose point data are exactly the same.There
    is no mark found they are same model. How to excluded the same data?

    3.Whether the data can be derived in accordance with the model is divided into
    a Element, so that is conducive to editing.

    Thank you for your appreciation.


    I am glad you solved some of your problems.


    The new issues sound more complex.


    I have no immediate fix for them.


    They may be caused by your coding.


    I would suggest lots of debugging, and lots of patience  :-)


    Maybe the most efficient way to explore them is to use more intimate database
    exploration methods:

  body: 'Dear Jeremy,


    Thank you for your patience and help me solve the problem.. Through your help,
    I can already export all the models and guarantee their position，material,transparency
    are all correct.This interface is very useful for exporting rendering models.


    But I still have a question to ask you: can the CustomExport interface be derived
    from the model?


    At present, the minimum unit of CustomExport interface is based on Element, such
    as a structural column model, which is composed of two parts of the top and the
    column body, the export data is two Element. I want to merge them into a model,
    so I look for all the attributes of Element, and only discover the name Category
    attribute can be used.. But there are different models of the category name attribute
    is the same, I can''t distinguish them.


    If there is a distinction between the model, please tell me, it is useful for
    the late model rendering and editing.
