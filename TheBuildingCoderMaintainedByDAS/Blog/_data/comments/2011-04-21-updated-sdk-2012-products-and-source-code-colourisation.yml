  body: 'Hi Jeremy,


    I don''t know why all Add-ins are inactivated in 3D View. That is  an error or
    a new property of Revit Architecture 2012?


    liebe Grüße,


    Trang.'

  body: "Dear Trang,\n\nThere are several possible reasons why external command buttons\
    \ might be grayed out, e.g.\n\n- You are in a Revit tool context other than the\
    \ main selection tool\n\n- You are in a perspective view (a view generated from\
    \ a camera)\n\n- You are in schedule view\n\nPlease check whether the 3D view\
    \ you are referring to is the *Default 3D View*, in which case none of the UI\
    \ widgets should be grayed out.\n\nIf it is a 3D view (perspective view) created\
    \ using a camera, the UI buttons will be grayed out. \n\nCheers and liebe Grüße\
    \ to you too, Jeremy."
