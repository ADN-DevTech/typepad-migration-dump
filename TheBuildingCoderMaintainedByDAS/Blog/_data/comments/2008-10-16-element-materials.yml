  body: 'Great topic Jeremy...


    I''ve often wondered about some of the interaction between the different Materials
    in an element...


    In a multi-layered wall, you need to get the CompoundLayerStructure to get at
    the interior/exterior wall material - do these translate out to the Interior/Exterior
    Wall faces?


    Also, I presume when you "paint" a material onto a wall face it picks it up with
    the approach listed above?


    Thanks - Matt'

  body: 'Hi Matt,


    Thanks for your appreciation! Yes, for a multi-layered wall you would look at
    the CompoundLayerStructure, and I would assume that each layer would produce its
    own faces with its own material assignments, some of them corresponding to the
    interior and exterior wall faces ... I have not tried it out, though.


    And yes, in response to your second assumption above, ''when you "paint" a material
    onto a wall face it picks it up with the approach listed above'' ... that is true
    as far as I know.


    Both of these might be topics for future posts.


    Best regards,


    Jeremy'

    I got a question...


    Can you get the area of materials associated to the face also?


    Cheers!'

  body: "Hi Pierre,\n\nThank you very much for resubmitting your email question as\
    \ a comment to the post! I prefer questions and answers becoming part of a public\
    \ dialogue, as much as possible.\n\nIf you look where the materials come from\
    \ in the method GetMaterials, you will note that each material is associated with\
    \ a face. The Face class has a property Area, so you can determine the area of\
    \ each material per face. If you want the total area of the material, you can\
    \ accumulate all those areas for each one. This could be designed similarly to\
    \ the volume summation presented in \n\n<a href=\"http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2009/02/compound-wall-layer-volumes.html\"\

    \nAnd bear in mind that all areas are in square feet.\n\nCheers, Jeremy."

  body: 'Hi Jeremy,

    ...another question.

    Can you get the volume of materials associated to the face also?

    Well ,the face don''t have a volume but the materials associated to this face
    is also associated to an Element,so it has a volume.

    Can I have the volume of element / material which is projected on the face ?

    Cheers

    Max'

  body: "Dear Max,\n\nThank you for your query, although it appears a bit confusing\
    \ to me. \n\nAs you say, the face has no volume, just an area. If you are applying\
    \ material evenly to the face and know its thickness, then you can calculate the\
    \ volume from that. \n\nIf the material is represented by some element, then you\
    \ can query that element for its geometry and calculate the volume from that.\n\
    \nThe last part of the question is still more confusing, because if you project\
    \ anything at all onto a face, it will once again become two-dimensional and thus\
    \ not have any volume.\n\nCheers, Jeremy."
