  body: 'Dear Ahssi,


    Do you mean the class CP333-1 ''Leveraging the Tail End of the BIM Life Cycle
    with APIs'' by Don Rudder from the Revit API Track at Autodesk University 2010?


    Wow.


    That is a long time ago.


    I would suggest to forget it.


    Instead, how about simply searching for Don Rudder''s more up-to-date classes
    at AU?


    <a href="http://au.autodesk.com/au-online/classes-on-demand/search?full-text=don+rudder">http://au.autodesk.com/au-online/classes-on-demand/search?full-text=don+rudder</a>


    This returns CP1749 ''Taking the Revit API to the Next Level as a Beginner'' by
    Don Rudder from 2012:


    <a href="http://au.autodesk.com/au-online/classes-on-demand/class-catalog/2012/autodesk-revit-for-architects/taking-the-autodesk-revit-api-to-the-next-level-as-a-beginner">http://au.autodesk.com/au-online/classes-on-demand/class-catalog/2012/autodesk-revit-for-architects/taking-the-autodesk-revit-api-to-the-next-level-as-a-beginner</a>


    Learn how to simplify your life and get quicker results when you use the Autodesk
    Revit API to automate or extend the functionality of Revit software. There are
    obvious cost savings associated with automation, but there''s an even larger ROI
    when even automation can be automated.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'
