    How can i attach information to elements of revit so that i can get it in GBXML

  body: 'Hi Sandeep,


    The standard method to attach arbitrary additional data to elements in Revit is
    by using a shared parameter, as discussed in the examples and samples listed in
    the blog category "Parameters". I do not know whether there is any way to cause
    this information custom information of your application to be automatically included
    in the gbXML export. I suspect not. The alternative is to export some kind of
    table of your own mapping the elements you are interested in to the relevant data,
    and then making use of this information in parallel with the gbXML data. You could
    implement an external utility to read in the two files exported from Revit, i.e.
    your table mapping element id to shared parameter value and the Revit generated
    gbXML file, and joining the two to write a new enhanced gbXML file including your
    data. I am not sure whether it is possible to add any custom data at all to a
    gbXML file, but if it is, this should be a viable workaround.


    Best regards, Jeremy.'

    I''m having problems trying to create walls that have constant sloped top edge.
    I tried using the NewWall method and passed in a CurveArray that contains the
    edges of the wall that would create a sloped top but the result was still a rectangular
    wall. Also, how would you alter an existing wall to have a top sloped edge?


    Thanks!'

    I tried using the NewWall method and passed in a CurveArray that contains the
    curves of the window opening(s), works most of times, for cases not working, is
    it because Curves of the window opening(s) not getting sorted? how to sort CurveArray
    w/ inner Curve(s) for wall creation? thanks.'

    from existing walls.


    i noticed the followings will affect the result:

    1) embeded sweep/reveal of existing walls

    2) allow join of existing walls


    don''t know if there''s a way to:

    1) temporarily "delete" sweep/reveal

    2) temporarily disallow join


    Cheers

  body: well, seems i can get much better result by using lines from existing walls
    (set to bearing temporarily) instead of solid/face/edge way, what a discovery!

  body: 'Hello Jeremy,

    As always this is a very informative post, provoking many thoughts for possible
    uses.


    I''m trying to modify your code so that I can get the footprint geometry of each
    individual wall at the current framing plan level (including the joint area with
    joined walls) and allowing for wall openings.

    (I''ll use this geometry to lay out the wall reinforcement.)


    Would you mind showing me how to modify the code or explain a little more of what
    you''re doing at each step so I can work it out for myself?


    To date I''ve managed to get some of the points, but I''m obviously not fully
    understanding everything that''s going on!


    Thanks and regards,


    Matt'

    Thank you for your appreciation!


    Yes, I agree that there are infinite possibilities for using this kind of geometric
    analysis.


    For getting a footprint, I would suggest having a look at a completely different
    approach as well, though.


    Keep in mind that for that kind of analysis, you are interested in a specific
    2D section view. This might be most easily obtained by making optimal use of built-in
    Revit functioanklity, e.g. by defining a section view at the exact height you
    are interested in and then extracting the geometry from its cut plane only, ignoring
    everything else:

    Any news from ning on his way of getting wall profile skipping wall joins? (simply
    a joined wall will report 7 polygon points instead of 5),

    I could not figure out from his post how he could overcome this using "lines"
    instead of solid/face/edges?
