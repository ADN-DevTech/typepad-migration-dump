  body: 'Hey there-


    I had a question along a similar vein.  I''ve created a family whose dimensions
    should be able to vary based upon some logic I am writing in the background.  I
    am trying to set a parameter in Revit 2013 that is Locked in the Family Editor.  It
    is a parameter of type "Length"  It is an instance parameter also.


    When I load the family into my project and create an instance of it, I can change
    the value of the instance and...no problem, the Length updates. But when trying
    to do the same thing via the API and the Set(double) method, no joy!


    Any ideas?
