  body: 'Hello,

    first of all, thanks for your site on the Revit API.


    I have a question:

    Is there a way to find all items of "Phase filter" ("New Construction", "Show
    All", etc..)? Is easy to find the parameter "VIEW_PHASE_FILTER" for a view, but
    not the full list.


    In practice, all "Phase Filter" can be filtered by a specific class?


    See you soon and thanks again.

  body: 'Dear Paolo,


    Thank you for the appreciation.


    I don''t completely understand your question, I''m afraid. Are you looking for
    all items that have any non-zero value whatsoever for the phase filter parameter?


    I can think of a number of solutions to attempt, based on the building blocks
    presented above.


    For instance, you could implement a new method GetAllPhaseIds similar to GetPhaseId
    which returns all phase element ids, and you could create a Boolean OR combination
    of a number of parameter filters which check for equality with any one of these
    ids.


    I think you will need to do some experimentation based on your exact requirements
    and the models you need to work with. I do hope the code presented above provides
    a useful starting point.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    I try to explain. I don''t seek architectural objects with a particular value
    of ''phase filter''. Instead, I would find the same values of ''phase filter''
    manually created in Revit. For example, these default values in Revit (italian
    version) are ''Mostra tutto'', ''Stato di fatto'', etc. in Revit (english version)
    should be ''Show all'', ''New construction'', etc. and others that the user has
    created.


    Can you find all these values through API?


    See you soon.

    I''ve tried finding the elements before, and I think you''re out of luck.


    If you look in RevitLookup, the phase filter elements are of type "Element", have
    no category, no visible/meaningful parameters, and no similar elements.


    All in all - they can only be found by name (if you know their names in advance)
    or by finding views that are using them.


    Best Regards,

    Matt'

    Thank you for your useful site. I have a floor plan view and I need to change

    First and foremost, we make no promises whatsoever about any future functionality.


    Secondly, if you want to see it come, please ensure that we are aware of that
    wish, e.g. by registering it as an API wish list item and participating in the
    API wishlist survey. There are some other Revit API wish lists around, I think,
    e.g. managed by AUGI.


    If you are an ADN member, please submit a DevHelp Online case so we can register
    a wish list item right away.


    Thank you!

    Unfortunately, there is no easy way to achieve what you want.


    We have an open wish list for this functionality.


    The workaround currently is:


    1. get all elements from the linked model


    2. filter those elements by active view categories


    3. filter elements by active view range values (top and bottom elevations).


    You can use the FilteredElementCollector class for all three of these phases.
