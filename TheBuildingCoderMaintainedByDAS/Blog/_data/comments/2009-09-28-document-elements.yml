    How could the Elements or get_Elements() return and iterator while the Document
    class does not implement IComparable. (according to the help file that comes with
    Revit SDK)


    Thanks in advance.'

    That''s the way it is, take it or leave it. It works.

    It is just that I have been studing .NET collections and enumration for days,
    and the Autodesk.Revit.Document class confused me because it does not implement
    IEnumrable or IEnumerableT, yet we still can enumerate through its elements using
    get_Elements() or Elements property.










    Thanks,





    Nadim'

    I see what you mean now. Well, the Elements property returns an iterator. The
    document itself is not an iterator.

    Here is another confusion I hope you would clariy.

    In general I feel that the RevitAPI has quite a few redundant classes.


    If you want to retreive the selected elements in a document, which one of the
    following two statements would you use? and Why?  (they both look the same to
    me especially that SelElementSet inherits ElementSet)


    1) ElementSet selElemSet = document.Selection.Elements


    2) SelElementSet selElemSet = document.Selection.Elements


    regards,

    Nadim'

  body: 'Dear Nadim,


    As you say, SelElementSet inherits from ElementSet. If you need the additional
    functionality provided by the derived class, use it. If not, use whichever you
    prefer. I would personally go for the one with the shorter, simpler name, if all
    else is equal. If you look at the selection code I present in The Building Coder
    samples, especially in the region ''Element Selection'' in the Util class, you
    can see what style I prefer.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    the additional methods in the SelElementSet. Sorry about that.
