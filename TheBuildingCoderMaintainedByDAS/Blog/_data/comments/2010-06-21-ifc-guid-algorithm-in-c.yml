    know that I can solve it - but I might be able to explain it.


    Door Geometry can be fundamentally different depending on the thickness of wall
    that the door is hosted in. At one point a few years back, I found that in some
    export cases there were "special" family symbols which were representing the different
    symbol/thickness variations.


    For what it''s worth - as they say :).

    Thank you very much for your note. Yes, this is in fact analogous to the issue

    Please help me.'

    An IFC file is not a trivial animal. I would suggest using a full-fledged toolkit

  body: 'Hi all,


    I wonder if its possible that Håkon''s algorithm can have some kind of open source
    license like the MIT attached so that it can be actually picked up by the industry!
    Its a pity that we cannot actually use this translation of the C code in our C#
    projects because of IP issues!


    By the way, where is the original C code and how it is licensed? It could be that
    the "translation" is not valid at all (i am not a lawyer!). Nobody seems to care
    about legal issues much, but we have to, as we are in the process of open-sourcing
    our code, and dont wont to depend on viral licenses like GPL, and also dont want
    to breach a copyright!'

  body: 'Dear Joerg,


    Oh dear, I am awfully sorry that you are faced with these issues.


    I am not, thank God, and I have no idea. I am still hoping I will survive without
    being forced to deal with that kind of stuff.


    As far as I know, I am the original author of the original C code that this is
    based on. That probably does not help, though.


    As far as I can tell, this same code is used in many IFC implementations all over
    the place.


    Probably you can find some copy somewhere which has a license attached to it.


    Its actually pretty trivial, anyway.


    Good luck!


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    I have been working on a number of utilities that require conversion between GUID''s
    and base64GUID''s. I have read many of your blogs on this subject and find them
    very useful and informative.


    I am not sure however if I have found an error in the Hakon Clausen code referenced
    above or whether its an error on my behalf (I tried downloading your version/implementation
    of the C# code from the buildingSMART technical website to see if I get the same
    error but there seems to be a problem with the zip file)


    The problem I have found is that certain GUID''s when converted to base64 and
    then back again don''t yield the same GUID. I am working on some tools to assist
    in producing COBie UK datasets from Cadduct (Autodesk Fabrication) models. An
    example of the type of error I am having is:



    the following GUID:


    01cf62c8-e9bc-bf88-0000-000000000005


    when converted to base64 with the above algorithm yields:


    01psB8wRl0Y00000000005


    When this is converted back to its standard form I get:


    01cf62c8-e9bb-c088-0000-000000000005


    I have a few otheer examples that do not work both ways, most of those I have
    tested however work fine.


    Any help/insight greatly appreciated.


    regards

    Paul'

  body: Paul, I tracked down the bug. Specifically there was a BitConverter.ToInt16
    call in there which should have been BitConverter.ToUInt16 like the rest. I have
    updated it a bit and added you test case. The whole thing can be found here <a

    Thank you both very much for reporting and fixing this!


    I added a note about the fix and the GitHub repository to the main blog post,
    to ensure it does not get missed.
