  body: "Dear Roman,\n\nI am glad to hear of your interest. Regarding your specific\
    \ questions:\n\n1. You can use any .NET language. C# or VB is easiest and recommended.\
    \ \n\n2. VSTA or Visual Studio Tools for Applications is built in to the Revit\
    \ product. The recommended external development environment is Microsoft Visual\
    \ Studio. You can also use the Express edition, which is free.\n\n3. The Building\
    \ Coder blog includes a category named 'Getting Started' which includes many topics\
    \ that are useful for novice Revit API users. A succinct overview of helpful additional\
    \ resources for getting started is provided in\n\n<a href=\"http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2009/04/getting-started-with-the-revit-2009-api.html\"\
    >http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2009/04/getting-started-with-the-revit-2009-api.html</a>\n\
    \nIt is written for the Revit 2009 API, but most of it applies equally well to\
    \ Revit 2010.\n\nGood luck and cheers, Jeremy."

    \ door, It will get two bottom faces which is the wall bottom face splitted by\
    \ door.\n  \n   thanks,\n   Jinshou."

  body: 'Dear Jinshou,


    You are absolutely right, and all kinds of exceptional and not so exceptional
    cases will need special handling for production use.


    Above all, you need lots of testing, and automated testing, and an ever-expanding
    collection of test cases to insure against regression.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: 'Hi, Jeremy,

    I found that the Revit 2012 API has some problems.Like that if the wall has one
    door, the bottom face should be split into two bottom faces by door, but by API
    get wall''s solid and get solid''s faces, only can get one bottom face, it should
    be two bottom faces. And if more than one door also can only get one bottom face.


    thanks,

    Jinshou.'

  body: "Dear Jinshou,\n\nI believe the Revit development team might disagree with\
    \ you there. \n\nWhy should there be two faces? One single face may contain multiple\
    \ loops, both disconnected outer loops and inner hole loops.\n\nThe bottom face\
    \ of a wall is probably always just one single face, as long as the wall has a\
    \ flat bottom at all, regardless of any doors it may contain. \n\nThat one face\
    \ may have holes in it, if the door really breaks through the bottom of the wall.\
    \ \n\nAlso, the door may be a little bit up in the wall, off the floor, with no\
    \ break at all in the bottom face.\n\nCheck out that one face and see whether\
    \ it contains multiple loops.\n\nCheers, Jeremy."
