    I am working on a detail component family which is going to be placed in section
    view and I need to create a masking region to cover some of the information visible
    underneath, I am having difficulty accessing any information about this in API/
    Developer Guide.I have tried to pre-create masking region into family template
    to modify it by accessing its elementId but I could not access any properties
    by doing this, Do you know any good example for this?'

    I see a wish list item in our database to create a masking region programmatically,
    and that is the only mention at all of this type of object that I am aware of.
    I added a note of your request to it and notified the development team.


    Cheers, Jeremy.
