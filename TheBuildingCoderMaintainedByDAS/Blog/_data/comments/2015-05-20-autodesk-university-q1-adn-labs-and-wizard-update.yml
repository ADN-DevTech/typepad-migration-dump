    Copernicus"

  body: 'Dear Don,


    Thank you for the heads up... however... which library do you mean, please?


    I searched the ADN Revit API Training labs and found nothing.


    I searched the wizards, both C# and VB, and found nothing.


    So I really don''t know what you are referring to.


    Thank you!


    Cheers, Jeremy.
