  body: "Jeremy, using this method, could you theoretically calculate the friction\
    \ loss of sprinkler piping systems?\n\nTo do so, in addition to what you show,\
    \ it would need to be able to know pipe/fitting elevations (pressure loss due\
    \ to elevation), take into account pressure increases due to fire pumps, take\
    \ out flows due to open hydrants, and only flow sprinklers (with a given k-factor)\
    \ which are set to \"flowing\" (in the sprinkler family), at a specified minimum\
    \ pressure.\n\nYou would also need a script that adds node tags to every junction/equipment\
    \ like inlet/outlet of fire pumps. \n\nIf you could do all that, sprinkler layout\
    \ technicians like me (and our companies) would be paying you around $1000-5000\
    \ for each license of your add-on... There are only two other companies that have\
    \ Revit \"solutions\" for fire sprinkler hydraulics right now, and both rely on\
    \ external programs or import/export functionality, both are buggy and no good,\
    \ and probably will never utilize this feature because they want to keep the hefty\
    \ $5000-12000 pricetag for their external software."

  body: 'Dear Gary,


    The procedure is identical for all Revit add-ins. It is described in full detail
    in the DevTV and interactive tutorials provided by the Revit developer centre
    and getting started materials:

  body: 'Jeremey,


    I have a comment and question about this addin.

    Under:

    static public void getSectionsFromSystem(MEPSystem system, List<MEPSection> sections)


    I had to change this line:

    MEPSection section = system.GetSectionByNumber(ii);

    to

    MEPSection section = system.GetSectionByIndex(ii);


    Because the sections weren''t necessarily in numerical order, and also didn''t
    always start at one. Maybe I misunderstood what you were doing there, but I was
    having a rough time getting all the sections until I changed this to index.


    My question is, when I use section.TotalPressureLoss, I get a double of 9.27246709...
    The API documentation under "MEPSection.TotalPressureLoss Property" states that
    the default value for this is Kgf per square feet, which converts to almost 4
    inches of water, way beyond what''s actually in my 2 diffuser system. Is KgF per
    square feet correct? Pascals, inhg, KgF per square meter, stones, slugs, furlongs,
    yards and atmospheres, don''t seem to correspond with the Revit reported value
    (using the system inspector) of 0.1222531 inwg either.


    As always thank you for this blog and the examples you provide.'

    Have you seen in the API a way to turn off system calculations for all piping
    and duct work instead of individually as currently required?'

  body: 'Dear Arif (or Arief  :-),


    No, I am not aware of any such switch.


    However, in the far distant past, I sometimes ran an MEP-specific add-in that
    only manipulated generic Revit element parameters in Revit Architecture, with
    no Revit MEP machinery available.


    That enabled me to make changes to the parameters and thus change the MEP model
    without any recalculations being triggered.


    Cheers, Jeremy.
