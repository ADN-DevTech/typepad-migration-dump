  body: 'Dear Stefano,


    Thank you for the ''beautiful'' attribute.


    I guess what you mean is how do I format my blog posts so that the source code
    is displayed nicely and with colour coding? That has nothing to do with RSS at
    all. I edit my posts manually in HTML. To obtain the colour coding, I make use
    of the functionality provided by Visual Studio. In addition, I installed a Visual
    Studio plug-in to copy the selected code snippet as HTML. It adds support to Visual
    Studio 2005 for copying source code, syntax highlighting, and line numbers as
    HTML. I insert the clipboard contents into my HTML blog text and that''s it, more
    or less. I also tried to use some other code colouring systems that are independent
    of Visual Studio. They also work, but they only colour code the C# keywords, not
    the classes defined in other namespaces, because they do not actually load and
    analyse the contents of those other namespaces. That is why I ended up using the
    Visual Studio plug-in after all, in spite of trying to solve the problem myself
    externally. Simply search on the web for keywords such as "visual studio copy
    as html". This will probably not work in VSTA, although I am not sure.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    As in DrawPolygons() method of current post, polygons are being drawn using different
    lines. I am also drawing the polygon like this o nly.

    In Revit User Interface, we can draw a polygon like triangle etc. by selecting
    polygon from model line Draw option.But is there any api method to draw the entire
    polygon as a single curve instead of set of lines.


    Kind Regards,

    Look at such a triangle through the API. What do you see? Is it not composed of
    individual model lines?


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    Thanks a lot for your reply.

    In Revit User Interface, no doubt the triangle/any polygon is composed of model
    lines only. That means we can not draw a polygon as a single curve?


    Actually my issue is I need to consider this polygon which is being drawn by set
    of lines as a single curve object. Can we do so?
