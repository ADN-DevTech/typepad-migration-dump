    Congratulations on implementing Revit.


    There was an issue with this once upon a time, but it should be fixed in Revit
    2012.


    What version are you using?


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    Well, then it should work  :-)


    I see no other reports on such a problem, and it was looked at prior to the 2012
    release...


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: 'Dear Niki,


    Some interesting news on this:


    1. The merge views check box in the UI has no effect; views are never merged in
    the UI regardless of the setting.


    2. The MergedViews property in the API is initially always set to false, regardless
    of the UI setting.


    3. The good news: The MergedViews property in the API does do the job you would
    expect, e.g. control whether or not views are merged.


    It seems to be the only way to control this, since the UI check box does not.


    Thank you for bringing this to our attention!


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: 'Dear Mnav,


    In the Revit 2012 API, DWGExportOptions is derived from ACADExportOptions, which
    in turn is based directly on the base class System.Object:


    System.Object

    > Autodesk.Revit.DB.ACADExportOptions

    > > Autodesk.Revit.DB.DWGExportOptions

    > > Autodesk.Revit.DB.DXFExportOptions


    CADExportOptions is the parent class of the other export option classes for DGN,
    DWF and SAT, but not DWG, so they are now unrelated:


    System.Object

    > Autodesk.Revit.DB.CADExportOptions

    > > Autodesk.Revit.DB.DGNExportOptions

    > > Autodesk.Revit.DB.DWFExportOptions

    > > Autodesk.Revit.DB.SATExportOptions


    In the Revit 2011 API, CADExportOptions was the parent class of ACADExportOptions
    as well, and thus the grandparent of DWGExportOptions:


    System.Object

    > Autodesk.Revit.DB.CADExportOptions

    > > Autodesk.Revit.DB.ACADExportOptions

    > > Autodesk.Revit.DB.DGNExportOptions

    > > Autodesk.Revit.DB.DWFExportOptions

    > > Autodesk.Revit.DB.SATExportOptions


    So you will have to address whatever you are trying to achieve differently in
    2012.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    I am trying to customize the Revit 2012 Export to CAD to suit our company standards.
    I need the application to take the layer mapping as it is fixed in the Revit file
    and not being read from a txt file or from a standard. The users are editing the
    export settings in the revit files and I need the export application to read these
    settings.


    Please advise.'

  body: 'Dear Mira,


    I am not aware of much customisation access to the built-in Revit CAD export functionality.


    I would suggest using it as is, and implementing your own add-in to export other
    additional data, such as the desired layer information, in parallel.


    At the other end of the process, e.g. from a stand-alone command line application
    or in the target CAD system, read in both the exported CAD file and your additional
    layer data information and merge the two in whatever way you like.


    For instance, if you are working with DWG, a stand-alone application could be
    implemented based on RealDWG, or you could use a .NET add-in inside of (or outside
    of, and driving) AutoCAD.


    Cheers, Jeremy.
