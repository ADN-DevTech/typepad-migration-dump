  body: Is there any way to find the intersections of lines in a revit document? Lines
    represent FamilyInstances of Beams and columns and I would like to find the points
    where these beams and columns intersect (not necessarily at their ends)

  body: Continuing with the above question, do I have to iterate through ALL family
    instances in a revit document to find which of them intersect the base family
    Instance? I am using Visual Basic

  body: 'Dear Tzavelis,


    Please have a look at the FindReferencesByDirection method, and especially at
    some of the previous posts which describe highly efficient, powerful and interesting
    uses of it, especially this one:


    http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2010/01/findreferencesbydirection.html


    As mentioned there, the Revit SDK Samples AvoidObstruction and RaytraceBounce
    also both demonstrate its use. Actually, the former does almost exactly what it
    sounds like you are intending to do.


    If you make use of this method, it will do the job for you and there is no need
    for you to iterate through any family instance or any other objects yourself at
    all.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    What rectangle?


    I suggest you explore its geometry and other properties using RevitLookup:

  body: 'Dear sir,

    When i m drawing two pipes connected at 90 degree, then revit automatically adds
    elbow in between them.

    Is there any way to get start-point and endpoint of that elbow to deal with it?


    Thanks & Regards,

    Nitin'

  body: 'Dear Nitin,


    When Revit adds elbows between your pipes, I assume that it also creates connections
    between them.


    You can access these through the connection manager and query their positions.


    From the connections, you can also access the neighbouring pipes and query their
    start and end points.


    Cheers, Jeremy.
