  body: 'Dear Pierre,


    No, I have never encountered this problem. Here are some sample code snippets
    excerpted from the Revit API introduction Lab6_2_Ribbon application that work
    for me:


    // prepare data for creating stackable buttons

    PushButtonData pbd1 = new PushButtonData( name1 + " 2", text1, addInPath, cmd1
    );


    PushButtonData pbd2 = new PushButtonData( name2, text2, addInPath, cmd2 );


    PulldownButtonData pbd3 = new PulldownButtonData( name3, text3 );


    // add stackable buttons

    IList ribbonItems = panel.AddStackedItems( pbd1, pbd2, pbd3 );


    // add two push buttons as sub-items of the Lab 1 commands

    PulldownButton pb3 = ribbonItems[2] as PulldownButton;


    pbd = new PushButtonData( name1, text1, addInPath, cmd1 );

    PushButton pb3_1 = pb3.AddPushButton( pbd );


    pbd = new PushButtonData( name2, text2, addInPath, cmd2 );

    PushButton pb3_2 = pb3.AddPushButton( pbd );


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: 'Jeremy,

    Is there a way to prevent members from auto-joining? I have an issue where I have
    structural framing with tiny offsets (intentionally introduced for connections).
    During automatic import via code all that geometry gets messed up becuase Revit
    readjusts member centerlines as it sees fit.'

  body: 'Dear Konstantin,


    Revit 2012 offers the possibility to allow and disallow wall end joins (cf. What''s
    New in the help file), but I do not believe there is any API access to this for
    other elements.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'
