  body: "Hi all, \nafter reading the blog posting, I think that the following is not\
    \ needed at all:\n\n\"compare the elevations of your Levels to find the one fitting\
    \ your location point\"\n\nBecause both skech-based and family-based Stairs have\
    \ got a parameter named \"BuiltInParameter.STAIRS_BASE_LEVEL_PARAM\", you can\
    \ get the Level *directly* without iterating through all your levels' elevations.\n\
    \nCheers,\nRudolf (Revitalizer)"
