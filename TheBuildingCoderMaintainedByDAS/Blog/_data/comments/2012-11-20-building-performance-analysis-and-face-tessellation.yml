    is it also possible to keep the face structure if I use the solid tessellation
    method?

    \ belong to which face.\n\nDo you see a problem anywhere?\n\nCheers, Jeremy."

  body: "Hello Jeremy,\n\nthanks for your reply. I'm still not sure how it's working.\
    \ \nWhen using the \nAutodesk.Revit.DB.SolidUtils.TessellateSolidOrShell(...)\n\
    Method I just get the solid containing vertices and triangles. But how can I receive\
    \ the face information? I cannot map it from the shells because the triangles\
    \ may look different.\n\nGreetings \nAl"
