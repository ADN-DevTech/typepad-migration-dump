    Thank you. I would like to know if it is possible to directly iterate through
    the rows in a schedule to extract data without the need of exporting it to text
    file and reading the data from the file.'

    Thank you for the information. Do you think we should publish this as a separate
    post? Might it be useful to others as well? If so, please email me a solution
    and maybe a little sample model to test it on, and I will promote this to a main
    blog post on its own.


    Thank you!

  body: 'Hi Jeremy,


    I was wondering, in regards to Revit Schedules, can you access the element that
    defines rows in a schedule?


    for instance, if you have sorted a schedule and suppressed the instances so that  the
    count for each row is greater than one, can you create a collection of elements
    and set the collections mark value?


    or do you need to some how programmatically identify the sorting being applied  and
    run the transaction separately and ignore the schedule completely?


    Thanks Much!!'

    Thank you for posting this as a comment.


    I am not aware of any such element that controls the schedule behaviour.


    To find out whether it works the way you suggest, I would set up the required
    situation manually through the user interface and then explore it using RevitLookup,
    the BipChecker, the interactive Python or Ruby shell, and any other tools that
    you find useful to detect the differences.


    That might tell you how to achieve your manual adjustment programmatically as
    well, if you are lucky and it is possible at all.


    What are you actually trying to achieve? Do you have to have the results displayed
    in a schedule like this, or are you only after the results themselves? Do you
    have to modify an existing schedule, or could you simply set up a completely new
    schedule satisfying your needs?


    As far as I am aware, the schedule creation API enables you to set up all possible
    kinds of schedules. I may be wrong, though.


    Please let us know what you find out. Thank you.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: I was trying to have a value populate similar to a mark value. When a set
    of criteria was met, the value would be "A1" or "A2" etc. to shortcut the process,
    i wanted to use the existing schedule to accomplish the goal.

    Unfortunately, this technique does not work if the schedule includes elements
    from RVT Links and it is those elements that you want to obtain.
