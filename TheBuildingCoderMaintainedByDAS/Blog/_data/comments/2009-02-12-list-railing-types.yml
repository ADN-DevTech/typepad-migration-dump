    I am still unclear what I can and cannot discuss and publish here on the upcoming
    versions, so I will reply to you by mail.


    I would recommend you to ask such a question through DevHelp Online, which will
    guarantee you a response from our whole team and will not put you in risk of violating
    your NDA  :-)

    Actually, I can answer right here and now after all, because I just thought of
    searching for RvtMgdDbg on the ADN web site, et voila, it is right there, plain
    as pie, at your disposal.


    As you may be aware, RvtMgdDbg comes complete with source code, so in case of
    need, you can always recompile it yourself for any version you please.


    It does also occur that some specific properties on some specific objects throw
    exceptions. If you discover such a situation, I suggest you run RvtMgdDbg in the
    debugger and simply wrap the offending line in its own little try-catch handler
    so you can continue working with the rest of the data. If you make any fixes,
    we will be happy to hear about them through ADN. Thank you!


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    It is a pleasure, as always. I see your question and I also received you email,
    but I see no significant difference between the code in your email and the code
    listed above. I do not quite understand what you are trying to get at. As you
    can see from the discussion above and other similar topics in the past, I also
    always have to do some research to find out how to effectively create a new instance
    of a family. What research have you done so far for your balcony?


    Best regards, Jeremy.'

  body: 'Hi Berria,


    I am beginning to suspect that you actually meant railing when you said balcony
    in you previous messages?


    And I also get the impression I was unclear in my posting above.


    To create a railing, you have to select the railing symbols, not the railing baluster
    ones.


    So the category is OST_StairsRailing, not OST_StairsRailingBaluster.


    The railing object uses a Symbol to define its type, not a FamilySymbol.


    So the class to search for is Symbol, not FamilySymbol.


    The post above mentions this fact. I am looking at implementing code to insert
    a new railing instance.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: 'Hi Berria,


    An unpleasant and tentatively final update on this issue: apparently, it is currently
    not possible to create a railing through the API at all. The problem is that in
    the list of the railing types that we obtain above, all railing types that we
    would like to use to create the railing instance are Symbol instances, and not
    FamilySymbol ones. However, in order to call the NewFamilyInstance method, we
    need a FamilySymbol. I do not know of any workaround. Sorry for the bad news and
    thank you for your perseverance.


    Put differently, Stairs and Railings use system families and not component families,
    which is why it is failing. It needs yet to be exposed through the API.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    To follow up and wrap up this discussion, I implemented a new command named CmdNewRailing
    in The Building Coder sample solution which unfortunately does NOT create a new
    railing instance for the reasons explained above. It can be used to explore the
    reasons and the limits we encounter. It is available in version 1.0.0.27 of The
    Building Coder source code, in the post

    I have to check with my colleagues first whether I can publish this.


    Regardless of that, the 2009 version of RvtMgdDbg is publicly available and includes
    source code, so if you have the pre-release 2010 version of Revit, there is nothing
    to stop you from porting the 2009 version to 2010 yourself:

  body: Hi Jeremmy.  I found a way to create Railings using the API. First I pick
    an existing railing and create a group of it. Then copy the group, ungroup and
    change the railing location line. I did this to place railings over the top of
    walls in a perimeter fence.

    Thank you very much for this hint, I am sure that will be very interesting for

    Congratulations on solving this!


    By the way, the Revit 2013 API now provides an official stair and railing API,
    which should simplify things significantly:
