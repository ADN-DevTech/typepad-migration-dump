    I''m having difficulties understanding the geometry of a 2''x2'' ceiling grid
    system.  I''ve used the sample code found here <a href="http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api/extracting-co-ordinates-from-geometry-of-room-or-any-other/td-p/5565050">http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api/extracting-co-ordinates-from-geometry-of-room-or-any-other/td-p/5565050</a>
    as well as the RevitLookup Snoop Parameter tool.  These have allowed me to see
    the ceiling face and associated edge geometries.  I''m at a loss in how to identify
    the lines that represent the ceiling runners. I would expect to find curves after
    reading <a href="http://help.autodesk.com/view/RVT/2015/ENU/?guid=GUID-7FCCA616-FFFF-4C43-B6C1-BD0543C3606C">http://help.autodesk.com/view/RVT/2015/ENU/?guid=GUID-7FCCA616-FFFF-4C43-B6C1-BD0543C3606C</a>
    but I''ve only been able to locate faces and edges that form the perimeter of
    the ceiling.  Any suggestions?'

    I read your Article "Re-Researching Lighting Family Instance Placement" with great
    interest as I have toiled with many of the issues discussed for well over a year
    now. I even found a code snippet on the same page relating to the first instance
    of a family not cutting its host correctly (I still have a chunk of code in my
    release version that deletes the first instance inserted to overcome this. I also
    reset the Mark parameter to 0 so that the deleted item does not interfere with
    the object numbering sequence).


    Given in the majority of cases Light fittings (or any other face hosted electrical/mechanical
    items) are inserted in models where the architecture is a linked model, I challenge
    you to create a working version of your code that attaches the family to a linked
    model. I have tried in vain to do this and posted comments to several of your
    previous blogs. I thought I could manage with the new 2015 "PostRequestForElementTypePlacement"
    command but we still have many projects that are using 2014.

  body: 'Dear Paul,


    Thank you for your very valid query and sorry for the delay in replying.


    I think I saw it elsewhere as well, didn''t I?


    I believe there is some new functionality in this area in Revit 2016.


    Can you raise an issue in the Revit API discussion forum for this?

    Please provide a minimal reproducible case for us to test and verify that we can
    really solve it:

    Thank you!


    Sorry to hear that you need it for Revit 2014 as well... that may be harder to
    achieve...


    Cheers, Jeremy.
