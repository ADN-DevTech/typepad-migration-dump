    I''m creating a 2015 macro that created a elliptical arc by projecting the points
    onto the curve of an ellipse to get the raw parameters and then uses makeBound()
    to create the arc. But I keep getting the wrong half of the ellipse. How do I
    get the other half?'

  body: 'Dear Paul,


    Have you resolved this by now?


    Are you using the Ellipse.Create method?


    All I can suggest off-hand is to switch the start and end parameters and stuff
    like that.


    Cheers, Jeremy.
