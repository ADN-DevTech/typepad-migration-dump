  body: The last one is VERY helpful.  I'm sure I would have bumped up against that
    one in the very near future.  In fact, it should probably be a DevNote if it isn't
    already.

  body: 'Dear Jeremy


    Thank you so much for the training at Barcelona. I will also include here the
    concept of joining API and AutoHotKey scripts (for reference from AUGI: <a href="http://forums.augi.com/showthread.php?t=84683">http://forums.augi.com/showthread.php?t=84683</a>
    or <a href="http://forums.augi.com/showthread.php?t=65897&highlight=revit+local+file+autohotkey)">http://forums.augi.com/showthread.php?t=65897&highlight=revit+local+file+autohotkey)</a>
    to perform some tasks which are still not available through the API. The second
    thread at AUGI is a very useful tool.


    Thanks again. Please keep giving us this great support with your blog.


    Cheers, RJ.'

  body: 'Dear Ramon,


    Thank you very much for the AutoHotKey pointers. I read them through and they
    really do look hot. Thank you also for your appreciation! I definitely do hope
    and expect to keep it up, Insha’Allah.


    Cheers, Jeremy.
