  body: 'Dear John,


    Step 3 is entirely your own responsibility. Step 1 is to copy the source IFC file
    to a fixed input file name and location, step 2 processes the input file and generates
    a fixed RVT output file. In step 3 you can access the RVT output file and do whatever
    you like with it.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: 'Hi John,


    Did you create the file yourself, and are you trying to re-execute it on the same
    computer system, and are all file names absolutely guaranteed correct? Well, strange.


    As you know, Autodesk does not support journal files for automisation purposes,
    so I don''t think I will try to either.


    Good luck to you sorting it out!


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: 'Dear Jeremy:


    I launched a journal file as an argument executing RAC 2011 with the Command Prompt
    and it worked, however, I followed the same procedure for RAC 2012 ("C:\Program
    Files\Autodesk\Revit Architecture 2012\Program\Revit.exe" "C:\Users\Hector\Desktop\Journal\
    journal.0171.txt") but the next message appeared to me:


    Journal Error: The journal file could not be run to completion. Utilize care in
    saving any work as the project may be in an unstable state

    ENTER INTERACTIVE MODE


    Any idea why?

    What could I do to fix this issue?

    Thanks a lot

    Regards

    \ all launch Revit with a journal file to execute from a command line batch file,\

  body: 'Dear Jeremy,


    You mean that I leave out the addin manifest and the addin assembly; therefore,
    I just used the journal file and I launched it from the windows command line;
    however, the procedure didn''t work within windows 7-64bit. Also I installed Revit
    2011 in this machine and the procedure didn''t work either. Nevertheless, I launched
    the journal file with Revit 2011 in a windows-32bit machine and it worked well.
    Do you think it''s about windows version?. The procedure was the same in all the
    cases:


    "C:\Program Files\Autodesk\Revit Architecture 2012\Program\Revit.exe" "C:\Users\Hector\Desktop\Journal\
    journal.0171.txt"


    What do you think about that?

    Thank you so much for your help
