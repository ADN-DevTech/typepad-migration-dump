    I used this code:

    "

    ModelLine modelLine = doc.Create.NewModelCurve(line, NewSketchPlanePassLine(line))
    as ModelLine;

    "

    to create model Lines, but why they will disappear after shutting down the application?
    I want the model lines can be saved. How can I do it?'

    Do you have any idea on my question? such as I need to refresh view after line

    I do not want to happen.'

    Is it possible to do through the user interface? If not, then there is probably

    perhaps you should make sure that your Revit is not in trial mode.

    You say that lines disappear after shutting down Revit.

    It says in the RevitAPI.chm that the Document.Save() method throws an exception
    when trying to invoke it in trial mode.

    So in this case nothing will be saved.


    Best regards,

    Congratulations on finding your mistake, and on making a silly mistake rather
    than a clever one. The latter are mostly much harder to discover and fix.


    Regarding changing the colour of specific elements, that is exactly the question
    answered by the sample code above.

    New functionality in the Revit 2012 API provides access to the FaceSplitter class,
    and the Face HasRegions property and GetRegions method.


    These give at least read access to the surface data of an element created using
    the paint tool.


    I don''t know about creating the surface data programmatically, though.

    I would start by reading the documentation on the View.ProjColorOverrideByElement
    property in the Revit API help file RevitAPI.chm. It says:


    Field Value: The override color of the elements that are to be overridden. A null
    reference (Nothing in Visual Basic) indicates that no override should be applied.


    Is that what you are looking for?

  body: Hi. I would like to apply a color scheme to the elements in a view, based
    on certain parameters - eg pricing (like a GIS legend). View.ProjColorOverrideByElement
    and View.CutColorOverrideByElement are nice, but any idea about something like
    FILLColorOverrideByElement. I was looking for it in the 2012 API, but in vain.
    I now create a temporary material with the desired color and apply it to the element(s)
    I want to color. It works, but it's slow (causes the model to regenerate), especially
    when there's al lot of elements to process. Any idea's of how to speed the coloring
    of element surfaces up? Changing the FILLColorOverrideByElement is possible in
    the UI, so it should be around somewhere in the dll's... Thanks in advance for
    any replies! Luc

  body: 'Dear Luc,


    I am not sure that the functionality you are looking for is accessible programmatically,
    or not completely.


    One thing I do now is that the Revit MEP API HVAC sample application uses a colour
    fill scheme to display air flow volume per room surface graphically.


    For that, it uses some kind of manually set up schedule, and the only thing done
    programmatically is to set the appropriate parameter value on each element. The
    parameter values are picked up be the schedule somehow and determine the fill
    colour in the graphics display.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    I will definitely take a look at the MEP HVAC application you''ve mentioned. Does
    this come with the standard download of the 2012 API? Or do I have to search for
    it on ADN?

  body: 'Hi Jeremy,


    First, thank you for keeping this blog. It has been very helpful while I am learning
    to use the Revit API.


    I am trying to change the detail level of an element within a view using the SetElementOverrides
    method in Revit 2014. The OverrideGraphicSettings object includes a property for
    DetailLevel that I am able to read and write to successfully. However, these changes
    are not reflected in the view while other overrides are. I also tried to set the
    detail level through a view filter using the SetFilterOverrides method with the
    same results. Is this a situation where "if I can''t do it with the user interface,
    it can''t be done", or am I missing something?


    Thanks!

    Tim'

    Thank you for your appreciation. I am very glad The Building Coder has proved
    helpful for you.


    I cannot tell off-hand whether the behaviour you describe is intentional or not.


    If the other overrides work fine and this one seems to change the property successfully
    but still has no effect, then it sounds like we should investigate it further.


    Can you provide a minimal reproducible case to test?
