  body: 'Jeremy,


    Using Revit 2009 API, I would like to save some elements present in a Revit project
    file into separate .rfa files.


    I proceed as follows:


    1: Open the Revit project (.rvt file)  and iterate over each element.


    2: When I encounter an element that must be saved, I need to save it into a .rfa
    file.


    It is quiet easy to do step 1. But, is it possible to do step 2 in Revit 2009
    API?


    How about Revit 2010 API - is it possible to do step 2 using that?


    Thank you.'

  body: "Hi Arun,\n\nIn a certain way, to create a valid RFA file, you need to make\
    \ use of the family editor. In Revit 2009, the API is deactivated when the family\
    \ editor is active, so you have no access to the API when the current document\
    \ is an RFA file. Even so, in the Revit 2009 API, you can create a new RFA file\
    \ in the background through the API using the Application.NewFamilyDocument method.\
    \ I have also seen examples of populating and saving such a file with certain\
    \ elements. However, such files caused problems when one tried to load them and\
    \ their families into a project. So realistically speaking, one has to say that\
    \ step 2 is not supported in 2009. \n\nIn 2010, the situation is radically changed.\
    \ In 2010, one of the main new API features is full access to the API within the\
    \ family editor context, and a whole host of new functionality to support the\
    \ creation of family files. So in 2010 all of what you describe is fully supported.\n\
    \nCheers, Jeremy."

  body: 'Hi Jeremy,

    I would like to create an Area element overlayed on a Room in an Area Plan view.
    I proceeded as follows:

    1. Retrieve the room''s boundary information

    2. Create a new AreaBoundaryLine for each BoundarySegment of the room boundary

    3. I got stuck here: Join two adjancent area boundary lines together so that all
    of the boundary lines will form an enclosed region (the next step is to place
    an Area element inside this region by calling the NewAreas(List of AreaCreationData)
    function)


    When I called set_ElementsAtJoin on the LocationCurve of a ModelCurve (object
    returned from a NewAreaBoundaryLine call), an exception "Operation is not valid
    due to the current state of the object." was raised at runtime.


    I wonder whether I used the set_ElementsAtJoin() method correctly or not. Can
    you explain or have any suggestions to solve this issue?


    Thank you!'

  body: "Dear Sebastian,\n\nI am quite surprised to hear that the LocationCurve ElementsAtJoin\
    \ property is read-write. I would have expected it to be read-only. Looking at\
    \ the Revit API help, I see the following description of this property: \n\nGet\
    \ all elements joining to the end of this element's location curve or change the\
    \ order of elements participation in the end join with this location curve's end.\
    \ The parameter 'end' specifies the end at which the join is to be obtained or\
    \ we want to change the order of joined participants. The list of elements is\
    \ expected to be a permutation of the elements already in the join at the end.\
    \ It is expected that no new elements will be introduced, and existing ones will\
    \ not be removed.\n\nSo you can obviously not use this property to add new elements\
    \ to be joined, as you are trying to do.\n\nHere is an example of a simple usage\
    \ of this method, to retrieve all the neighbouring walls connected to an existing\
    \ one:\n\nvoid GetWallNeighbours( Wall wall )\n{\n  LocationCurve lc = wall.Location\
    \ as LocationCurve;\n  List neighboursStart = lc.get_ElementsAtJoin( 0 );\n  List\
    \ neighboursEnd = lc.get_ElementsAtJoin( 1 );\n}\n\nBack to your main goal, creating\
    \ an area. First of all, I suggest having a look at the developer guide, chapter\
    \ 20.1 Rooms. The Table 47 describes the Room, Area, and Tags relationships. Apparently,\
    \ an area is just a sort of Room element, so the existing samples for creating\
    \ rooms should be pretty close to what you need.\n\nI will make a note that it\
    \ would be useful to create a sample that shows how to create a new area element,\
    \ but I cannot tell you when or whether I will find time to actually implement\
    \ it.\n\nCheers, Jeremy."

    Have you tried using the method Document.NewAreaViewPlan?


    Its use is demonstrated by the ElementsBatchCreation Revit SDK sample.

    Is it possible to create a multiple area plans through API.


    I want to create  my own area plan apart from the available rentable and gross

    I am very glad you searched for and found an answer on your own.


    I don''t know exactly what feature you might be referring to.


    And anyway, I don''t really know anything about any new releases  :-)


    Cheers, Jeremy.'
