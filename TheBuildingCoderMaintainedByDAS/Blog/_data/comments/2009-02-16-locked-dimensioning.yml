  body: 'Thx again for this exellent post Jeremy.

    Copy or move objects before deleting is a good idea. We can also make a copy of
    the file before deleting all dimensions...


    Maybe you have seen that I''ve got a new problem with splitted faces area in Object....maybe
    a new post....


    Cheers.'

  body: "Hi Pierre,\n\nThank you for your appreciation and feedback!\n\nYes, I saw\
    \ your email on the split faces. For completeness sake, I note here that you are\
    \ asking about API access to the geometry and above all the area of split faces.\
    \ Unfortunately, this is a topic that I have already had several questions about\
    \ and explored in some depth but not been able to make any significant progress\
    \ on yet. I explored what elements are added, similarly to the process descibed\
    \ above. Briefly, adding a face split creates the following types of new elements:\
    \ a sketch plane, a sketch, a split face element, model lines, and automatic sketch\
    \ dimensions. I tried to find the relationship between these elements but was\
    \ unable to determine or retrieve the links between them. I also asked the development\
    \ team about this issue, and received the following answers:\n\n1. Is there a\
    \ way to access information about materials painted on split faces using the existing\
    \ API? No.\n\n2. If this information is not available through the API, could we\
    \ use a schedule and export them manually, or an ODBC export, also exported manually,\
    \ to access that information? No, because split face elements do not schedule\
    \ and do not export to ODBC.\n\nSo it seems as if this information really is hard\
    \ to access.\n\nOn the other hand, I can see in the image that you pointed me\
    \ to that the area information of a split face is in fact accessible in a schedule\
    \ table, so it can be calculated, displayed and viewed in the Revit user interface.\
    \ Therefore, it should be possible to access and extract this information by creating\
    \ the schedule and exporting it to Excel, shouldn't it? And that process should\
    \ be automatable using a tool like AutoHotKey, shouldn't it?\n\nIf anybody can\
    \ find a way to access this information, I will be happy to post on that. I will\
    \ also gladly present more detailed information on the elements created by adding\
    \ a face split. \n\nCheers, Jeremy."

    I was reading the seconde answer by development team and I was really surprised
    to read that the development ignore that we can make a schedule wich got spitted
    faces are!...can believe!...


    Anyway, the solution might be that we have to schedule manually and export it
    in a text file. That''s a possibility and that''s no too bad. I''m gonna do it....

    No, I have never tried to automate schedule data exporting. Is it possible to
    manually export schedule data in spreadsheet format? In that case, it is hopefully
    possible to automate that process as well, c.f.

    I know that we can use AutoHotkey but, I''d like to write my schedule export in
    a specific format...mhh...

    I can use AutoHotKey to export schedule in txt and running my API script after
    but, that''s not very clean....

    Mhh, still surching...

  body: 'Hi Pierre,


    The first challenge is to obtain access to the data at all, in any way whatsoever.
    Making use of tools like the Win32 API or AutoHotKey also introduces synchronisation
    issues and questions on how to coordinate the application with the simulated interaction
    through the Revit user interface and its results. Once the data is accessible,
    in whatever format that may be, converting to another format is no big issue.

    I am trying to make a family of pipe fitting with parameter with the help of "family

    But I can not make sence the meaning of "Lookup Table name" in the Family types
    tab.

    Can you please help me with the proper making of family fitting with parameter.

    As in many other Revit programming queries, the first question to ask before looking
    at the API possibilities is whether this is possible in the user interface. If
    not, then you can probably not do anything through the API either.
