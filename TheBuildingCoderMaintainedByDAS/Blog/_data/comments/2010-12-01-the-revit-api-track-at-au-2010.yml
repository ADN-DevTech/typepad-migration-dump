    I am referencing to the following post:


    <a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2009/02/revit-window-handle-and-modeless-dialogues.html">http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2009/02/revit-window-handle-and-modeless-dialogues.html</a>


    This is great to have post like this. Here i am using the code for Form that look
    like pallet same like AutoCAD or like constantly appearing windows form. i tried
    this by using code as given above. I want to maintain that screen using "while(DialogResult
    dr != DialogResult.Cancel)"


    but it runs infinite loop and revit gets hang...

    I am using Revit 2011 Structure for this.'

    It was good seeing you again and thanks for the plug for my CP333-1 class! This
    year''s AU was a very powerful and useful exposure in terms of the Revit API.
    Looking forward to next year!

  body: 'Dear Sherif,


    I am sorry to say that this is not straightforward. Actually, I do not think it
    is possible. Once the DocumentChanged method is called, the deleted element is
    already gone and inaccessible, and the transaction has been closed, as described
    in


    <a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2010/10/access-deleted-element.html">http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2010/10/access-deleted-element.html</a>


    That post also describes a workaround using the dynamic model update framework
    DMU.


    I hope this helps.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'
