  body: I just have one correction on your Hebrew.  You wrote the phrase for "I don't
    speak Hebrew" correctly in Hebrew but the transliteration is actually "Ani lo
    medebare ivrit".  I hope you get to visit again.  It's a wonderful place.

    Thank you very much for the correction!

    I updated the post accordingly.


    Yes, it really is a wonderful place!
