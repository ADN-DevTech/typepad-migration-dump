  body: 'In Regards to Hangers in Revit MEP 2011 would this method work:


    to create a hanger object in the family editor and then import it as a component
    with a host (ie Cable Tray)...how can this be done since Cable Tray is a system
    family.  Also the reason for doing this would be that for a final result we would
    be able to create a parameter on cable tray saying after every x amount of feet
    display a hanger.  I am currently working on this and was wondering if you had
    any insight into getting this done'

    Sounds like an interesting project. Unfortunately, I can only guess whether it

    let us know how it goes! Thank you!

    I don''t really know myself. The only things I know about pipe hangers are documented
