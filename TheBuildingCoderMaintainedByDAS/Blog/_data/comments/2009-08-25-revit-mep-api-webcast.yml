  body: 'Hi Jeremy,

    I am interested in watching the webcast - I have registered actually. But there''s
    no time displayed in the registration site. FYI I need to translate the time to
    my timezone, Melbourne Australia. Pls let me know the webcast time.


    Also, I wonder if the Revit API family (MEP/Architecture) contains API/SDK to
    Green building studio? To me, GBS still appears as a black box - and it would
    be great to explore and extend GBS along with Revit Architecture and MEP.


    Cheers, Flora'

  body: 'Dear Flora,


    Glad to hear you are interested. The time is communicated to you automatically
    in an email sent to your email address after you register, containing the login
    details for the live meeting and telephone conference. For completeness sake,
    I can also reveal that the exact time is 2009-08-27 16:00 GMT  :-)


    No, I am not aware of any API to Green Building studio included with any of the
    Revit products. You may want to check the information provided among the Autodesk
    Green Building Studio white papers at


    <a href="http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/index?siteID=123112&id=11261770">http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/index?siteID=123112&id=11261770</a>


    It includes a document on getting started with the Green Building Studio web service:
    This document describes how to access your Autodesk Green Building Studio web-service
    account and manage projects:

    Is that what you are looking for?


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: "Hi Jeremy,\n\nI'm interested with MEP since in my current project I need\
    \ to incorporate service engineering design into the conceptual design stage.\
    \ \n\nI've received the confirmation email from Autodesk but it doesn't mention\
    \ the time of the webcast. It's going to be 2AM in Melbourne! Or 1AM if it's following\
    \ British summer time - just to be sure, is it GMT or BST?\n\nI've gone through\
    \ the papers and tried to setup a project. But what I really need is to be able\
    \ to customize the information going in and out to and from GBS since we're in\
    \ Australia and the context of the simulation is handled quite differently.\n\
    So that's why I'm wondering if there's any API / SDK / Scripting capability to\
    \ extend GBS - just like Ecotect has Ecotect / Lua scripting or Revit with its\
    \ API.\n\n\nFlora"

  body: 'Dear Flora,


    Oops, sorry, right you are, 16:00 BST, I guess, 17:00 CET or central European
    time, which is where I am at.


    As said, the Green Building Studio functionality is accessed through a web service.
    I believe that if you enter the correct URL in a web browser, the web service
    methods will automatically provide some rudimentary documentation to you, so you
    could theoretically discover the API methods and parameters yourself through the
    browser ... at least I used that approach myself when exploring a different web
    service a couple of years back. I am still exploring whether I can find anything
    easier to provide to you. But first I have to get this webcast done  :-)


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    Is the webcast going to be recorded?

    I don''t think I am able to be wide awake at that time.
