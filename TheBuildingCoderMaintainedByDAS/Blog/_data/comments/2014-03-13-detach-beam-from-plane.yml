    When is your  next Revit API training class? I am looking forward to joint your
    classes.


    Thanks.'

  body: "Dear Bachir,\n\nThere are none planned right now, I'm afraid. All I can offer\
    \ right now is the getting started material: \n\n<a href=\"http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/about-the-author.html#2\"\
    >http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/about-the-author.html#2</a>\n\nIt is\
    \ pretty complete, actually. A training will assume all of that knowledge, and\
    \ then go on to more specialised topics. These will always depend on the participants\
    \ anyway.\n\nCheers, Jeremy."

  body: 'Hi Jeremy,


    With regards to detaching things from work planes, I often find myself wanting
    to disassociate (face-based) family instances that have been placed "by face".  The
    reason being that I want that family instance to remain in its 3d position and
    not react to any changes to the original face geometry (often caused by reloading/editing
    of the original host family).  In the UI this is pretty cumbersome.  Do you see
    any way to do this in the UI without recreating a cloned family instance?


    Thanks,

    Joe'

  body: "Dear Joe,\n\nPlease excuse the delay in replying. The reason is simple: I\
    \ asked the development team several times and had to wait for an answer. It arrived\
    \ and says:\n\nI am not aware of an obvious way to do this in the UI, so I suspect\
    \ there is no obvious way in the API either, just as you hint: \"In the UI this\
    \ is pretty cumbersome.\"\n\nIn general, the API seldom supports anything that\
    \ is not supported by the UI.\n\nIt seems that the stated goal: \"I want that\
    \ family instance to remain in its 3D position and not react to any changes to\
    \ the original face geometry\" contradicts the tenant of being hosted.\n \nPerhaps\
    \ you could elaborate a bit on what kind of application this is, and why hosting\
    \ is both desirable and unwanted. Perhaps the solution is to not have the application\
    \ use hosted things in the first place.\n\nI hope this helps.\n\nCheers, Jeremy.\n\
