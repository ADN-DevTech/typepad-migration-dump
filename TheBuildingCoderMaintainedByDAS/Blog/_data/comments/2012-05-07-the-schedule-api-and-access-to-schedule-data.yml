    it would be nice if we could also access the background color in schedule cells.

    Think of displaying values in different ways, depending on different conditions.

    We can perform the colorizing via GUI, so why not via API ?


    Thanks,

    Rudolf'

    The schedule API rocks and I have used it extensively in our new product Project
    Browser for creating what we call queries - .

    <a href="http://revitfb.blogspot.co.nz/2012/05/project-browser-for-revit-2013-now.html">http://revitfb.blogspot.co.nz/2012/05/project-browser-for-revit-2013-now.html</a>


    Please though allow us to access the element ID’s that are contained within the
    schedule, or at least allow us to schedule the elements ID values.  At the moment
    I have to export the schedule to a txt file compare the family types and names
    and then back in Revit match the corresponding objects.  That is pretty inefficient.


    Good start though ;)


    Cheers

    Thank you very much for your appreciation, and I am very glad to hear that you
    are already making good use of this functionality.


    Your project browser sounds like a powerful tool. Sorry that you have jump through
    such silly hoops to access the data you require.


    My suggestion to Rudolf applies to your case as well: please submit an ADN DevHelp
    Online request for this and I will file a wish list item for access to the element
    ids for you.

    It is a workaround, though, and rather kludgy. I know of no other way, though.

    Very usefull your blog if you ask me ;)


    Using the ScheduleDefinition.GetSchedulableFields it is possible to iterate through
    the available (shared) parameters and add or insert (addfield or insertfield)
    them to the created schedule.



    However I wish to add a calculated value / calculated field to the schedule. This
    field does not show up in GetSchedulableFields because this field has to be added
    ''on the fly''. In the API there is a schedulefieldtype.formula member which suggest
    it may be possible to add a calculated field. Do you know how to add a calculated
    field because I am running out of ideas. Or is this not possible (yet)?



    Thanks,

    Raymond'

    Yes, sorry, currently not possible. Revit 2013 provided a first stab at a schedule
    API, to be fledged out in future, e.g. to access individual values.

    Yes, sure, it is. Take a look at the fourth bullet item here:

    Look at the presentation, recording and sample code provided there.


    Look at the overview of the ''ViewSchedule changes'' in the What''s New in the
    Revit 2014 overview:

    Is it possible to populate a Schedule Key from excel, without assigning the parameters
    to any instance?


    I would like to create a shedule key to have drop down lists, following a work
    a quantities map from excel. Only then i would assign the keys to the elements
    i choose an that way i would have an optimizes process to create and update the
    maps for each project.


    Also i tried to install you Scheduledata sample, but i´m not getting it right.
    It would be nice to have it functioning to understand a little bit better the
    programming language needed to work around the schedules data.


    I have the plug-in installed but when i run it i get the following message:


    "Revit encountered a Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions.ArgumentException: Contains invalid
    characters

    Parameter name:mane at Autodesk.Revit.DB.ViewSchedule.Export(String folder, String
    name, ViewScheduleExportOptions options) .... "



    Any idea of what the problem is?'

    I am not a user so I have no idea what a schedule key is.


    Ask me about extensible storage instead  :-)

    From Revit 2014 onwards, you can populate schedule data directly:

    > ViewSchedule changes.


    I have no idea what might be causing your error.


    I suggest working through the Revit API getting started material and learning
    to use the Visual Studio debugger to see for yourself what is going on:
