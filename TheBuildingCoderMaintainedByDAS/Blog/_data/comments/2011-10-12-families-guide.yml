    As Steve mentions the lines are being blured.  Check out <a href="http://www.revitworks.co.nz/Products/Factories/DoorFactory.aspx">http://www.revitworks.co.nz/Products/Factories/DoorFactory.aspx</a>
    where we coded this app along with the IP and families provided by RevitWorks.


    Cheers

    Awesome indeed, I fully concur with Steve!


    One minimal comment: the video recording was sort of stuttering here, and the
    resolution so high that the on-screen text entries were kind of hard to read,
    they were so small. I would advise setting up a lower resolution before recording
    a video like that, both for speed and easier reading of on-screen text.


    Thank you for sharing this.


    Cheers, Jeremy.
