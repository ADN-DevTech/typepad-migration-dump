  body: "Jeremy,\nI am creating a setup project for my Revit External Application,\
    \ and I am trying to edit the Revit.ini through the setup.\nI have read tons of\
    \ pages on MSDN about Custom Action, \nimplemented it, but never worked.\n\nI\
    \ know the changes to Revit.ini could be done through a DLL that uses StreamReader\
    \ and StreamWriter, this is the easy part. but I can't get them to be executed\
    \ by the windows installer.\n\nHere is what I did for testing:\n1. Created compiled\
    \ a DLL with a single method that sends a message box.\n\n2. I added a custom\
    \ action to the setup project in my solution where I browsed and added the DLL\
    \ created in step 1 to the Install folder in the Custom Action editor.\n\n3. It\
    \ never executed.\n\nI tried that with a DLL, DLL compiled as a windows application,\
    \ an exe, ... you name it.\n\nPlease help or at least guide me to where I can\
    \ find the solution before I loose my eyes staring for hours at websites trying\
    \ to find it.\n\nRegards,\nNadim"

    Nope, I have not come across this before, but then I never print anything. Have
    you tried checking for existence of the file and deleting it if found before you
    launch the print?


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: 'I found the problem.

    Basically, it is caused by the PrintManager.PrintToFileName property.


    I did work around it; however, I think the problem is in the Revit UI setup for
    printing electronic files.


    Example: when you print a pdf, the pdf printer will give you the choice to pick
    a folder to save at.  It will overrite it if you choose to.


    With that said, I don''t undertand why the Revit asks you to put a path for the
    file before. It is redudant.  It will be overriden by the pdf printer anyway.
    and it is causing this issue.  IF you can pass it on to Revit Developers would
    be great.


    I hope this help.

    Thanks.'
