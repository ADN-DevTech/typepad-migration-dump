    I already answered your question here:

    You are welcome to continue asking as many times as you want.


    It will not help if you do not read the reply, though.


    If you do wish to repeat the question on a regular basis, a two-week cycle is
    fine by me (the previous query was on May 7)   :-)


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: Do you think Vac3 would be the best way to get a Revit model into Cesium <a
    href="http://cesiumjs.org/?">http://cesiumjs.org/?</a> How about geo-locating
    a Revit model in Cesium, has a good workflow been established for specifying the
    exact location of a Revit model on earth?

  body: 'Dear Chris,


    I was not previously aware of Cesium.


    Thank you for pointing it out.


    If you look at the Cesium home page, you may note that it says "Draw 3D models
    using COLLADA and glTF".


    Collada OBJ is a file format for defining 3D models, and has nothing to do with
    the three.js JSON format that RvtCa3c generates.


    Oh, I see that Collada is the originator of glTF as well, the "graphics library
    Transmission Format":


    <a href="https://www.khronos.org/assets/uploads/developers/library/2013-march-meetup-COLLADA/Khronos%20glTF%20COLLADA%20Meetup%20Mar13.pdf">https://www.khronos.org/assets/uploads/developers/library/2013-march-meetup-COLLADA/Khronos%20glTF%20COLLADA%20Meetup%20Mar13.pdf</a>


    Even more so, they are also involved in the Cesium project:


    <a href="https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/cesium">https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/cesium</a>


    The Cesium home page also states that it uses optimised WebGL.


    The three.js JSON format generated by RvtVa3c is probably pretty close to whatever
    glTF expects, if not identical.


    I would love to hear what else you find out about this and whether the formats
    are identical, compatible or what.


    Thank you!


    Cheers, Jeremy.
