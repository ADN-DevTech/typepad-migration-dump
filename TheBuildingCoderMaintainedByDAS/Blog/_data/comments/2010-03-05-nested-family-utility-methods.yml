  body: 'I have adapted this code to extract nested family instances and it works
    beautifully.  However, I have a new problem.


    How can I extract the nested family instances if the quantity and position of
    the nested family instances is different for each instance of the parent family
    in the project.


    Example:  I have a lighting fixture family (track light) that contains nested
    lighting fixture family instances (each can-light on the track).  The nested instances
    are part of an array which is defined by the parent instance in the project.  Each
    parent instance can have a different number of nested instances.

    Initially I thought that the FamilyInstance.SubComponents property would work
    for this, however it is always null!  When does the SubComponents property return
    anything?  The API documentation is very sparse.


    Any ideas on how to access nested family instances from the parent instance?'

  body: 'Dear Joel,


    First of all, I am glad to hear that it works well so far.


    I have described a few other aspects of nested family instances that may be of
    use to you:

    I am also checking for more info on the SubComponents property for you.


    Cheers, Jeremy.
