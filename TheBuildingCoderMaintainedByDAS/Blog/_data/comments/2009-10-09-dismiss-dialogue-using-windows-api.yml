  body: 'hello!


    is it possible having a timer loading a new view every X seconds? lets say that
    for example the computer is used for a presentation and i would like to load a
    different view ever 30 seconds. would that be possible? i tried but since the
    timer runs on its own thread i get a message telling me that there is no istance
    for the application (uiapp)


    thanks

  body: 'Dear Jeremy,


    thanks for your quick and kind answer, i tried to understand the example you posted
    but i am very green in programming apis. here is what i am working on: i want
    to render a sequence of views overnight. so i made a form where i choose from
    all the available 3D-Views the ones i want to render, and put them in a list.
    when i confirm that the application starts rendering (so far so good..) but then
    i have to check every X seconds if the "rendering progress" window is still open.
    when the plugin detects that the rendering finished it loads the new view and
    starts rendering. its all progged except the part with the timer because i am
    able to check the render window, but i am not able to change view from inside
    the timer. could you PLEASE make a very short example on how to change view with
    the idle function? all that webcam stuff is very confusing for me. sorry if i
    ask you too much!


    thanks


    regards


    Igor'

  body: 'Dear Igor,


    I would love to help you with this, and I can even promise that I will look at
    it when I have some time left over.


    Unfortunately, that means that you are in for a very long wait.


    I should point out that this is not a suitable project to begin learning the API
    with.


    I would suggest doing some other stuff to get to know the Revit API a bit better.


    Once you know a bit of programming in general, or better still have some experience
    in .NET, then the Revit API is not hard to understand at all.


    From what you explain above, you know more than enough to get to grips with it.


    Have a look at the ModelessDialog ModelessForm_ExternalEvent and ModelessForm_IdlingEvent
    SDK samples, and also take a gander at


    <a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2010/11/pattern-for-semi-asynchronous-idling-api-access.html">http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2010/11/pattern-for-semi-asynchronous-idling-api-access.html</a>


    The latter is older, and still provides some interesting insight on what it is
    all about.


    Good luck!


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: 'sorry for bothering you again! i dont know if i understood the logic behind
    all this right:


    -i execute my addin, and the "execute" function opens a modeless form. by using
    the "while using" inside the execute function i prevent it from finishing and
    remains active as long as the modeless form is active.


    -in the modeless form i can place a timer or whatever i want to execute my code.
    and to access the revit app i use the idle method. idle has a list of "thigs to
    do". and in order to make revit do something i add sort of tasks to this list..


    is this correct?


    thanks


    ps: sorry for all the questions, i used to program inventor apis and that was
    way easier and better documented then the revit apis. i feel like in open ocean..'

  body: 'Dear Igor,


    Nope, not quite. Your Execute method displays the modeless form and then returns
    immediately. As far as Revit is concerned, your command has ended. Before returning,
    you subscribe to the Idling event. The rest is correct: in the event handler,
    you check whether your modeless form has submitted some task to be executed, and
    so on.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    Glad to hear that you are trying to make use of it. I am looking forward to hearing
    how it goes.


    I have no idea what you should optimally search for.


    Basically, for any dialogue that you wish to use this for, you would need to explore
    its innards and adapt the caption and other details based on information obtained
    from the dialogue itself using some Windows debugging tool like Spy or Spy++:
