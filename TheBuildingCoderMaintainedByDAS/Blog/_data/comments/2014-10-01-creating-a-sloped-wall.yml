  body: 'Dear Cliff,


    Thank you very much for your comment, and sorry to hear that you have been campaigning
    fruitlessly for this for so long.


    I am sorry to say that the Revit API will very seldom enable you to achieve anything
    that is not supported by the product itself and the user interface, so I do not
    see much hope at this end.


    All I can suggest is to remain adamant and ensure that your wish is registered
    in all available wish lists, so that the product manager and development team
    really are properly aware of it and its significance.


    I hope this helps.


    Cheers, Jeremy.
