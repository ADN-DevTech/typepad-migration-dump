    What would be your solution to not being able to Place more Rooms in a Revit floor
    plan? Even though there are more room bounded spaces, but you get the Room placing
    mouse over message in a room space "Not Enclosed" followed by a popup warning
    "Room Computations Failed". All warnings have been cleaned up and still this problem
    persists. No duplicate rooms, no not placed rooms on schedule, no overlapping
    walls or overlapping room separating lines. Copied and pasted entire model into
    a new project. Same problem.'

    First of all, I would take a look at the Document.NewRooms2 method.


    Cheers, Jeremy.
