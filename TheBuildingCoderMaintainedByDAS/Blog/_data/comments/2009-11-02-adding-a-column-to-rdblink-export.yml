  body: 'Hi Jeremy,


    Hope, you are fine.

    Got a question today : (I search in vain)

    Is it possible to do a zoom out via API?

    I can do using a SendKeys but, in 2009 API, is it possible via a command?


    Cheers!'

  body: "Hello Jeremy,\n\nI hope all is well!  I saw this post, and after searching\
    \ and searching for info, decided to post this question in hopes you can point\
    \ me in the right direction.\n\nI am trying to use the RDB link to connect to\
    \ MSAccess and MSExcel, however, the only driver available to create a new data\
    \ source is SQL.  If I open the ODBC Data Source Administrator (from c:\\windows\\\
    syswow64\\odbcad32.exe), I can create a DSN, however it is not availble (or visible)in\
    \ the RDB Link Select Data Source dialog.\n\nI am using Windows XP (64Bit) for\
    \ an OS, and there appears to be a lack of drivers developed for 64bit ODBC \n\
    The only option I get is for SQL Server and I am not having any luck finding anything\
    \ on Microsoft’s site on how to get these drivers (for Access or Excel) installed.\n\
    \nAny help would be greatly appreciated!\n\nThanks Jeremy,\n\nBest Regards,\n\n\

  body: 'Dear Daniel,


    Here are two suggestions from colleagues of mine, although one of them is the
    option you already know:


    Stephen’s usual suggestion is wrapping the 32 bit driver functionality in a 32
    bit stand-alone COM server that, since it’s stand alone, could also be used from
    a 64 bit process.


    “I understand that Microsoft do not issue a 64-bit version of the ODBC driver
    for MS Access. The 32-bit driver can’t load into the AutoCAD 64-bit process space,
    so the only solution I can suggest is to create a 32-bit standalone executable
    that exposes a COM server to act as an intermediary between your AutoCAD application
    and Access.”


    Joe’s usual suggestion is using another driver e.g. SQL Server:


    “Last we checked, Microsoft does not provide an ODBC driver for Access or Excel
    in their 64-bit operating systems. I believe this is listed in the Known Issues
    document for Revit 64. You might be able to work around this by using the ODBC
    export driver (assuming it exists) for SQL Server and then using SQL Server Express
    to view and change the data.”


    Thank you Stephen and Joe for these, and Adam for pointing them out to me!


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: 'Hi Jeremy,

    I have managed to set up the RDBLink and having a great time in Access and SQL....


    Do you know if the Room Associations (for Doors) should be exported? I want to
    be able to push the room number into the door instances after some update statments
    in the exported database.


    When exporting from Revit i get the tables RoomAssociations and RoomFromToAssociations
    but they are both blank?any idea''s?


    Thanks in advance'

  body: "Dear Toby,\n\nCongratulations on getting it up and running and having fun\
    \ there. \n\nNope, sorry, I don't know that off-hand. Have you had a look at the\
    \ documentation in ReadMe_RDBLink.rtf in the Revit SDK? That is a pretty comprehensive\
    \ document, and I would have assumed that all associations were documented there.\n\
    \nIt also says that “some new relationships will be created, such as area load\
    \ on slab, line load on beam, window on wall etc. These tables and relationships\
    \ do not exist in Revit ODBC exported database.”\n\nSince you have the full source\
    \ code, you can debug that and find out what is going on for yourself, and even\
    \ add other additional relationships if you require them.\n\nCheers, Jeremy."
