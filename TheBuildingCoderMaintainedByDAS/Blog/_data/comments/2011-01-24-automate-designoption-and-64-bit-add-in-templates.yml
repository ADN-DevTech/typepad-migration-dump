  body: 'Hi Jeremy,

    Thanks for this, it has been very useful.


    As an addition, you don''t necessarily need to hard code ''C:\program files'',
    you can use the system variable $(ProgramW6432) to make it a bit more flexible.


    Thanks,


    Neil'

  body: "Dear Neil,\n\nThank you very much for the suggestion. As we discussed by\
    \ private email, this only works on a 64 bit OS, and not on 32 bits.\n\nI tried\
    \ updating and testing on 32 bits and found out the hard way.\n\nAs you say yourself:\n\
    \n\"It improves flexibility just a little bit, in as much as if a user has moved\
    \ there program files folder, or possibly is using a non-English copy of windows\
    \ then their program files will not necessarily be in 'C:\\Program files', so\
    \ using this variable takes care of that.\n \nYou are correct that this variable\
    \ is only available on 64 bit systems, and then, only from within a 32 bit program\
    \ it seems. Very annoying. So unfortunately it doesn't help with having a single\
    \ template for both 32 and 64 bit systems.\n \nThe whole way that Microsoft went\
    \ about the 64 bit OS seems very odd, but we have to live with it how it is.\"\
    \n\nThank you!\n\nCheers, Jeremy."

    As far as I know you cannot prevent an undo operation, nor exclude any specific
    operation from being undone.


    Cheers, Jeremy.
