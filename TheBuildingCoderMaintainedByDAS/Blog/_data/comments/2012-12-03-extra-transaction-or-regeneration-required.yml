  body: 'Hi Jeremy,

    happy new year 1st of all!


    Q1

    I''m loading a floor tag using api (Document.LoadFamily)

    -manual transaction, then regenerating the model-

    but Revit doesn''t want to use it: e.g.

    in the user interface: Tag all recognize it, but tag by category says: no tag
    is loaded!


    (using Document.Create.NewTag method -in a new transaction after regenerating-
    also throws an exception that no tag is loaded!)


    Q2

    other silly where-can-I-find-question:

    how to create a legend view?


    thanks,


    -----'
