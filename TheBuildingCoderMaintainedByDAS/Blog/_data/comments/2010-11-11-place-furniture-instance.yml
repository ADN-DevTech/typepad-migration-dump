    As stated above, it could be a floor. You''ll have to try it out in your context
    for your own needs.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: 'Dear Jeremy

    Thanks for your effort. I was wondering how I can allow the user to add certain
    type of families to the view port through the API.

    I''m designing a family browser (a tree view which contains a bunch of families
    types). When the user double click the family type tree node he can be able directly
    to start drawing the instance on the view port, also I need to know how to do
    drag and drop from Revit 2012 into a window based form.

    Thanks in advance.'
