  body: "Dear Mr. Jeremy Tammik, \nI need to extract some information from a rvt file\
    \ in an application that refers the RevitAPI.dll, without launching Autodesk Revit\
    \ Architecture. The Autodesk.Revit.Application object has a method to open a rvt\
    \ file, but i cannot use it because is not possible to instance this object outside\
    \ a plug-in that runs inside Revit environment. There is a way to open a rvt file\
    \ outside Autodesk Revit Architecture? \nThanks in advance,\nMartino"

    I would have hoped that that question is completely answered by the description
    above and the previous posts on this subject.


    The short answer is no.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'
