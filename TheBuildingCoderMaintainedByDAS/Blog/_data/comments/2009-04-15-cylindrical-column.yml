  body: 'Hi Jeremy,

    Hope you enjoyed your vacation :)

    I am trying to get the origin for the faces of a structural column. The column
    I have is a cylindrical column & I am using the same code as the one you included
    above. Yet, the code is always returning a PlanarFace type & never a CylindricalFace
    although when inspecting the element using Revit Lookup Add-in, I get both Planar
    & Cylindrical Face categories.

    Please advise.


    Thank you,'

    Thank you, I did indeed.


    It should be simple. I cannot think of any reason why the above approach should
    not work.


    If you see the desired data in RevitLookup, you should see it in your add-in as
    well.


    All I can suggest is to start from scratch and try again, debug RevitLookup and
    see what it does, implement the identical approach in your add-in. You have the
    code. The power is yours  :-)


    Maybe some trivial bug, a variable not intialised correctly, the loop counter
    not increment?


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    Take a look at the face normal as returned by the Face.ComputeDerivatives method.
    One should point up and the other down. Or, more generally, they should point
    in opposite directions.


    Cheers, Jeremy.
