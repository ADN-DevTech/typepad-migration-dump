    Util.TolPointOnPlane?

    what is it "Util" and where I can find this?'

    Util is some utility class, and TolPointOnPlane defines the tolerance within which
    a point is considered to lie on the plane. Simply substitute a small number of
    your choice, such as 1.e-9.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: 'Hi Jeremy,


    Is it possible to move elements that are associated with a Work Plan by using
    the API?  I am triing to move elements using this code:


    …

    foreach (ElementId id in ids)

    {

    ElementTransformUtils.CopyElements(CachedDoc, ids, pointRefT);

    …


    But the element associate with a Work Plan won’t move?

    Is it possible to dissociate with the API an element from a Work Plan?


    Thanks, JF'

  body: "Dear JF,\n\nI really cannot say off-hand, I have never tried it.\n\nTwo comments\
    \ on your question, though: \n\n1. You say 'move', and you are using the CopyElements.\
    \ It does not move elements, it copies them.\n\n2. You are providing an argument\
    \ named pointRefT to the method. Please be aware that that argument is an offset,\
    \ i.e. a vector, not a point.\n\nI hope you are aware of the methods available\
    \ to explore the model on your own, to examine element properties and parameter\
    \ values, e.g. RevitLookup and BipChecker.\n\nI strongly recommend you search\
    \ for, read about, install and make heavy use of them both.\n\nCheers, Jeremy."

  body: "Hi Jeremy, \n\nThanks for the advice, Iwill try RevitLookup and BipChecker.\n\
    \nI realize that I send you the code in which I try to copy elements that are\
    \ associated with a Work Plan instead of move them, but it didn’t work either…\
    \ In fact what I’m trying to do is to create a function that will move the Project\
    \ Base Point to the point (0,0,0) of the Revit project internal coordinate and\
    \ in the same time move the project with the same vector.  I’m trying to make\
    \ this function to make easier the insertion of a revit link (for example a structure\
    \ Revit link into architecture Revit file.  If all the Revit file use the point\
    \ (0,0,0) of the Revit project internal coordinate, I could use origin to origin\
    \ to place the link without  having to move the link.  I know that I can use the\
    \ shared parameters but I have to place manually the link at the right place the\
    \ first time.  I don’t know if you have a solution for this problem?\n\nThanks,\
    \ JF"
