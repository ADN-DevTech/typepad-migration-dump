    Thanks for this post, it helped me in one of my projects.


    I write to a database on every save (or synchronise) as a "usage log". But it
    was making the file "dirty" since i was using the "Saved" and "Synchronised" events,
    moving the code to "Saving" and "Synchronising" fixed the problem.'

    I am very glad this post was of use to you, and thank you very much for pointing
    out the "dirtying" side effect of the Saved and Synchronised events versus the
    clean behaviour of Saving and Synchronising. Good to know.


    Cheers, Jeremy.
