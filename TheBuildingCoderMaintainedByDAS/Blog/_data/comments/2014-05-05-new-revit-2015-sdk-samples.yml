  body: "Hi Jeremy,\n\nfirst thanks very much for your blog. It helps me all the time\
    \ when I have a problem with the Revit API.\n\nI was very excited about the new\
    \ possibilities to set default family types. I created a small plug in which loads\
    \ families or family types, sets a selected type as the default type and lets\
    \ the user add family instances with a post command. \n\nIt works very well except\
    \ with detail components. I checked the GetSetDefaultTypes API example and it\
    \ seems that there is the same problem. Is there a Bug in the Revit API? Can you\
    \ provide some help with this topic?\n\nThank you very much!"
