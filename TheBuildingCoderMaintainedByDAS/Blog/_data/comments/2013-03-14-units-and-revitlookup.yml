  body: Hi Jeremy, Rebuilding the latest RevitLookup as discussed above results in
    91 Warnngs about obsolete classes and methods. Is there an updated version for
    2013? Thanks, Dale

  body: RevitLookup appears to not be included in the 2014 SDK, and the old version
    fails due to changes in the API. Has anyone made a 2014 version of this tool?
