  body: 'Hi Jeremy,


    here is an off-topic addition, relating to the planet joke:


    As of now, there are 999 *confirmed* exoplanets.

    Confirming the 1000th will happen soon.

    I think this is worth mentioning ;-)



    Cheers,

    Rudolf'

    Wow, yes.


    I looked this up myself as well via the Wikipedia list of potential habitable
    exoplanets:


    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_potential_habitable_exoplanets">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_potential_habitable_exoplanets</a>


    That points to the Habitable Exoplanets Catalog:


    <a href="http://phl.upr.edu/projects/habitable-exoplanets-catalog/data/database">http://phl.upr.edu/projects/habitable-exoplanets-catalog/data/database</a>


    The CSV file I downloaded from there does indeed currently contain 999 lines,
    with one of them representing the header, so 998 entries, which is close enough.


    Thank you for the interesting news.


    Are you planning on moving anytime soon, then?


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    <a href="http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/">http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/</a>

    says there were 999 confirms.


    But either 998 or 999, the meaning ist the same: a milestone is set.

    A thousand known worlds are surrounding us.


    Wow.

    But no need to move there ;-)

    Actually to use numeric id to get RevitCommandId for custom command is not a good
    way.

    I think this number may be different on each computer and it depends on how many
    external applications installed on user machine and how many commands defined
    there.


    To use command name is more reliable.


    Regards,

    Victor.'

    The development team replied to your note on the issue REVIT-33901 and report:


    For this case, the TypeProperties command, I tested the code in Revit 2015 and

    So I cannot say why you are running into a problem at your end. I hope you can
    resolve it.


    Good luck.

  body: 'Dear Kim,


    I am sorry to say that the PostCommand functionality just launches the built-in
    Revit command as it is, including all its user interaction.


    It does not include any possibility to supply any additional input arguments or
    programmatically define the selection.


    It will prompt the user for the standard manual interaction, just like Revit normally
    would.


    If you wish to trim or extend a specific list of ducts programmatically, I would
    suggest using the Revit API duct connection functionality.


    I explored some different possibilities that you can use while researching various
    ways to implement a rolling offset:

  body: 'Dear Jason,


    No, I was not aware of that.


    Do you mean the Revit command name input argument ''name'' to the RevitCommandId.LookupCommandId
    method?


    I can perfectly well imagine that it is treated in a case sensitive manner, actually.


    I can also perfectly well see how that might be confusing to some.


    It is probably an intentional didactical trick to teach (and force) people to
    use copy and paste and nothing but copy and paste when transferring strings longer
    than two or three characters from one place to another  :-)


    Sorry about your head. I hope it is still intact, none the worse for wear and
    all the bumps recede.

    You need to be within a valid Revit API context to make any calls at all to the

    Please read up on this in the topic section on Idling and External Events for

    No, you cannot post your own external command; only Revit can do that.
