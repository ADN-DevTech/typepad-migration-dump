    I tried to load the addin file in my Revit 2014, but it says that misses the FlowParam.dll

  body: 'Dear Diego,


    That is exactly as it should be.


    The compiled DLL cannot be provided by The Building Coder for licensing reasons.


    The Building Coder provides sample source code for illustrative and didactic purposes
    only.


    If you want to make use of it, you have to compile the source code provided yourself.


    I hope this clarifies.


    Cheers, Jeremy.
