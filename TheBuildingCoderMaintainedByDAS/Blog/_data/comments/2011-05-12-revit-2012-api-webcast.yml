  body: "Dear Olli,\n\nI discussed the issue with the development team, and we do\
    \ expect to have something available within a month or two. I'm sorry to say there\
    \ is nothing at all available yet. They also added that it is probably hard to\
    \ make any significant progress without some sample code. Sorry for the bad news\
    \ and thank you for your patience! \n\nPlease raise an ADN case in a couple of\
    \ weeks' time and ask again, and hopefully we will have something for you by then.\n\
    \nCheers, Jeremy."

    Yes...I was thinking that because this is so new feature in API, there might not
    be any examples yet. And the fact that I''m totally newbie with the IFC, it makes
    very hard to dig into this API.


    But yes...no problems...I''ll be patient :-). I might send some feedback trough
    ADN DHO at some point and provide some example which I have tried.'

    The host physical compoment of a given analytical model can be obtained by AnalyticalModel.GetElementId()
    method. It returns the Id of the physical compoment.
