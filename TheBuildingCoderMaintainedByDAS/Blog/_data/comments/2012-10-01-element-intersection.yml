  body: 'Hi Jeremy,


    Let''s say I have two famlies, and want to find all famlies that intersects with
    these using ElementIntersectsElementFilter, and then

    add different strings to comments depending on which of these two famlies they
    intersect with. However, if

    a family intersects with both of these, I need a way to determine which family
    "intersects more" than the other. Is there a way to do this?

    Or can I locate the insertion point of the famlies and see if that part intersect
    with either of the famlies?


    Cheers,

    Martin'

    Yes, sure you can.


    You can use the Boolean intersection utils to intersect the solids obtained from
    the family instances with each other and determine their volume:
