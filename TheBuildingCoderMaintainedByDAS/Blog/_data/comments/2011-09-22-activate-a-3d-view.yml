    Yes, it is, isn''t it? Thank you for your appreciation!


    And for assigning a view template to the current view, have you had a look at
    the View.ApplyTemplate method?


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    I have a question about pickpoint() function,In 3DView,when I select "Front" or
    "Back" or "Left" or "Right" view,the pickpoint() will not return a point,because
    it can''t not pick a point on curent Workplane,is there any ideas to solve this
    problem?

    Thanks.

    Guming.'

    A quick question (just out of curiosity) regarding not wrapping the doc.ActiveView
    assignment. Technically by reassigning the active view one actually alters the
    database?

    Thanks,

  body: 'Dear Dima,


    I have no idea what the reasoning behind this is, all I can do is speculate. Possibly
    setting the active view is such a precarious operation or somehow involves some
    mixture of internal user interface and database operations that Revit prefers
    to have full control over wrapping it into a transaction (or not) itself. Your
    guess is as good as mine.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    I am not sure you are right. Doesn''t the View.ApplyTemplate method fulfill your
    need?

    If you mean ''in the OnStartup event handler'' when you say ''while you are in
    IExternalApplication'', then I would answer ''not possible''.

    It is the orthographic scale, or perspective angle (both can be replaced by an

    Without this, I cannot correctly draw my own points that satisfies the view (level
