  body: 'Hi Jeremy, hi Eduardo,


    when the button is invoked, you could subsribe to OnIdling event to gain access
    to the Revit database.


    Button disabled: as far as I know, we need to set the AvailabilityClassName property
    of the RibbonButton...

    Ah, I see that Autodesk.Windows.RibbonButton class differs from Autodesk.Revit.UI.RibbonButton
    class.


    Since you are using the first one, there is no AvailabilityClassName property
    on your button object.


    Instead of this, I think there is some sort of "command binding" which manages
    the visibility.

    I just looked over Kean''s blog postings but did not found related entries so
    far.


    Since we can get the adWin.RibbonButton from the Revit.UI.RibbonButton via Reflection,
    there might be a way to cast the first into the second.


    Sorry for providing just ideas and suggestions, but maybe that may help you nontheless.



    Cheers,

    Rudolf'

  body: 'Hi Jeremy


    I have been creating various add-ins for Revit and have managed to create a custom
    Ribbon tab on which to place all the commands/icons.


    What I would like to do, but cannot find any information on how to achieve it
    is to add an existing in-built Revit command onto my custom Ribbon. I want to
    add the "Modify" command as the first item on my Ribbon.


    many thanks

    Paul'

    You can create a new custom external command of your own, just like usual.


    Within it, you can invoke the existing Revit built-in command using the PostCommand
    functionality:

  body: Class ExternalCommandRegisterPage implements IExternalCommandAvailability
    which has an IsCommandAvailable method.  The implementation forces you to register
    the dialog when a document isn't loaded.

    Ours is not to wonder why, ours is but to do or die.


    Do you have it working now?
