  body: 'We use revit to create wall assemblies which consist of wall and window and
    door elements. We name it due to wall length; door window code; and empty/solid
    panels. For example e 2500 "DD1LW8" is panel name for length of 2500 mm wall from
    left to right consists of "D(solid panel)+D1L(left D1 door type)+W8(window type
    8)


    . My purpose is to write api code, to create auto assemblies from wall and its
    nested window door elements, and auto name it with wall length+door type/window
    type+solid/empty panels,  due to start to end sequence on the wall line.


    Is it possible to write this kind of code'

    Yes, absolutely.


    I would suggest that you start by getting to know Revit well from the user point
    of view and research the optimal workflow and best practices manually.


    After that, work through the Revit API getting started material:

    That should give you an idea how to start approaching the problem at least.


    I hope this helps.


    Cheers, Jeremy.
