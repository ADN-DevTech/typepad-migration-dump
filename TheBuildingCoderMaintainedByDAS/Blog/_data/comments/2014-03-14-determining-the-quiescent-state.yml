  body: 'Hi Jeremy,

    Couldn''t command availability be used for this (Revit 2014+)? Check the external
    source for a flag, and if the flag shows that it is available, set availability
    to true.

    I''m note sure how often the command availability checks?

    Adding the item to QAC would show availability at all times.

  body: 'Dear Matt,


    Thank you for the helpful new idea.


    However, I think that the command availability API will behave like all other
    approaches and hit the same stumbling block:


    No Revit API methods at all can be called if the Revit API is inaccessible.


    The Revit API is accessible when Revit is quiescent.


    Whenever Revit is not quiescent, the Revit API is inaccessible.


    Intuitively, I would assume that the command availability checks fire more or
    less equally often as the Idling event.


    That said, I have not tried it out.


    As said above, all known reliable modeless user interaction approaches currently
    work around the issue to avoid this need.


    If someone really needs this functionality and is willing to try it out, she should
    definitely give the command availability a whirl as well.


    Cheers, Jeremy.
