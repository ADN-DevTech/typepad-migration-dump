  body: 'Hi Jeremy,

    Is there is any other way to zoom? i.e. other than ShowElements(). The case is
    like, i want to highlight specific portion of the current selected element. There
    is a way in Autocad to zoom particular element, do we have this any with Revit
    API?


    Thanks,

    Sandeep'

    Sorry, currently ShowElements is the only method available that I know of.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: 'Hi Jeremy,


    I''m looking at Loose Connectors to get my head around modeless Revit dialogs
    for another project I have in mind, and have noticed that prior to invoking Loose
    Connectors the Revit Process idles along as you''d expect, but as soon as Loose
    Connectors is run the Revit process sits around 50% CPU usage, and stays there,
    even after the Loose Connectors dialog is closed.


    Have I done something wrong in compiling it, or is there a tweak that needs to
    be made to the code?


    Thanks,


    Col.'

    Thank you very much for this interesting and rather worrying observation. Yes,
    I see the same behaviour. Funnily enough, when I actually do something in the
    loose connector navigator dialogue, such as simply scrolling up and down, the
    Revit CPU usage goes down, only to rise to 50% again when I stop.


    And yes, it stays up there at 50% even after I close the window.


    I don''t know what can be causing this.


    I suggest that you read very carefully all the pitfalls of the Idling event that
    Arnost Lobel has warned us about in his critiques of various Idling examples presented
    in this blog, and see whether you can find anything causing this, or even maybe
    fix it.


    On the other hand, maybe Revit simply starts sending Idling notifications all
    of its free time once some add-in has subscribed to that event, and never stops,
    so there is nothing that we can do about it. Maybe.


    Does this behaviour cause any discernible problems for you, or are you just worrying
    out of principle?


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: 'Dear Col,


    Here is some more feedback on this issue from our Idling event expert Arnošt Löbel:


    1. Yes, it is true that the Idling event, once it is subscribed to, consumes certain
    CPU cycles almost ''all the time''. We are exploring alternatives, but that is
    the way it is for now. FYI: on my computer, the 50% is just 12%.


    2. If an event handler is properly unsubscribed, Revit should stop raising the
    event. It only raises it as long as there are any subscribers. It is most likely
    not enough that the dialog that owns the event dies, because Revit also owns a
    tracking handle of the event handler and that prevents it from being garbage collected.
    Therefore it is important to unregister the handler as soon as it is not needed
    anymore (and definitely upon the application’s exit.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: 'Thanks for the replies Jeremy (and Arnošt).


    The behaviour doesn''t appear to degrade performance, but I know that if I develop
    an add-in that does this people will query it.  Revit users are already precious
    about workstation performance. (so yes, worrying out of principle!).


    I''ll add in the code to unregister the handler.  Ultimately, for the future,
    Revit could do with something like AutoCAD''s palettes.
