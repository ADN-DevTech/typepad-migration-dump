  body: 'Jeremy,

    is it possible to modify floor Opening boundary at all? I looked at most of your
    posts and API samples covering floors and their openings, but could not find a
    single mention of this. I am currently working on a piece of code which needs
    to update the slab/floor opening (non rectangular) profiles without deleting them
    but in my investigations i found that opening.BoundaryCurves property is ''read
    only'' making it impossible to swap/add/delete curves in that curveArray. I wonder
    if anyone has tried any other approach to solve this?

    I think that currently there is no official way to achieve that, sorry to say.


    You may be able to get at the existing sketch and its model lines using undocumented
    element id relationships:

    Then you might be able to modify the existing lines a little bit in place under
    certain circumstances.


    Another way to create an opening in a wall is to insert a custom dummy window
    instance. If you do that, you could later edit the window family to modify the
    shape.


    Please look at this discussion as well, and the comments on it:

    No official standard approach, though.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    What about if you assume the slab is not horizontal but sloping like in a ramped
    car park?

  body: "Dear Russ,\n\nThe same principles apply. \n\nOne would obviously have to\
    \ replace the call to Util.IsHorizontal by something very slightly more sophisticated,\
    \ though. \n\nFor instance, assuming that the ramp is more wide and long than\
    \ high, one could first select the two faces with the largest areas, hoping that\
    \ they would be the top and bottom ones, and then pick the lower of the two. \n\
    \nAnother approach would be to pick the two faces whose normal vectors have the\
    \ smallest horizontal components, i.e. minimal X and Y components, or better still\
    \ minimal x*x+y*y, and then again take the lower of those two.\n\nOne could also\
    \ go for the top face instead of the bottom one, if that is more suitable.\n\n\
    Isn't freedom a wonderful thing?\n\nCheers, Jeremy."

    No idea what the problem might be. The Creator class should easy do what you need.
    Is your slab generated by code or manually? You can provide a minimal sample for
    us to take a look, if you like:

    Slab is generated manually.  I''ll have another look at it this weekend when I''ll
    have a but of quiet time to concentrate.'

    Sorry about the convoluted approach.


    We are doing our best, I assure you  :-)


    Things like this happen when complex systems evolve. Thank you for your understanding.


    Cheers, Jeremy.
