  body: "Hi Jeremy,\ni will try to look into the line thing, if i know more i just\
    \ write you a coment again.\n\nbut now i just have 1 more little thing that i\
    \ was trying to do.\nmost of the time when we sent out drawings for construction\
    \ and/or approval, we Plot the sheet, and after that we make an export of the\
    \ drawing to dwg. this is done for correct achivement of our drawings, plus during\
    \ construction the DWG sit still asked for.\n\nnow i was wondering, could this\
    \ be done trough a simple add-in button, after all these are all functions that\
    \ already exist, but will be much more easy to do trough 1 button.\n\nAlso, in\
    \ Autocad we have a LSP routine for this, making the drawing make a copy of himself\
    \ to some certain spot on the harddisc, puting a certain text spamp on it,making\
    \ pdf, and so on. \n\ncould such a lsp for autocad even be \"connected\" to the\
    \ exported dwg from revit ? so this all is done with just 1 simple click on the\
    \ add-in toolbar in revit ?\n\nBest Regards,\nDante"

  body: "Dear Dante,\n\nIf all of this can be achieved by simple mouse clicks, then\
    \ you should be able to automate it as well.\n\nThe easiest way to automate things\
    \ is if they are accessible through the API. \n\nIf not, you can also try to simulate\
    \ user input through Windows messages or other utilities, cf.\n\n<a href=\"http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2009/05/vb-samples-and-other-questions.html#1\"\

    \nIf you have an AutoCAD utility that does part of the task for you, then you\
    \ can probably drive AutoCAD and plug-ins loaded into it from a Revit add-in,\
