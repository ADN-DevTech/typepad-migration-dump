  body: Jeremy, regarding the journal path, I think the application object now has
    the path to the currently running journal.

  body: 'Dear Ahmed,


    Nope, I certainly cannot do this for you.


    My job here is not to do things for you, but to support you in achieving it yourself.


    This blog includes numerous examples of creating walls, and also on accessing
    the data of the reference planes. All you need to do is read the reference plane
    data and feed it into the static Wall.Create method.


    Cheers, Jeremy.
