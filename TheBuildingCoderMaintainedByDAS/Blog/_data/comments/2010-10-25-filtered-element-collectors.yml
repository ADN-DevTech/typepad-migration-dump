  body: 'Dear Bang,


    Well, there are many ways to achieve that.


    Also, when you say ''used'', this can mean a lot of different things.


    You have no idea how interlinked your model may be, and what complex relationships
    are maintained in the background, so when you ''use'' one thing, a hundred others
    that you are unaware of may be required to support that operation.


    Do you mean model elements?

    Model Elements</a></li>

    <li><a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2010/10/model-elements-revisited.html">Model
    Elements Revisited</a></li>

    </ul>


    Do you mean the elements you added yourself?


    You can use the DocumentChanged event to track all newly added, deleted and modified
    elements.


    You can use the element lister to retrieve a quick overview of the database contents.


    And, of course, you can use RevitLookup to explore everything, always.


    Cheers, Jeremy.
