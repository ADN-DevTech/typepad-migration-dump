    is totally make sense to us. It is really very interesting to read the article.

    I have gone through many blogs, sites and forums which been providing great knowledge
    about the same, as like recently i was reading something about Building Geometry
    on <a href="http://www.o-n.com/">http://www.o-n.com/</a>  the information that
    shared here is also great.

    I appreciate your effort for supply this type of vital information and sure I''ll
    come again across your blog when you will share something new.

    Thanks,'

    There are a number of ways to proceed. One is to read the geometry of all elements
    and collect the points from that. For greater efficiency, you may want to filter
    the points you find and only keep unique instances. This is demonstrated by various
    blog posts on geometry:

    For instance, you can use the approach illustrated by the XyzEqualityComparer
    helper class and the way I make use of it in the GetVertices method in

    Thank you very much for pointing this out!


    I published an updated version of this material from Autodesk University 2011
    directly here on The Building Coder instead to keep it safely accessible:

    I hope this helps.
