  body: 'Hi Guy,


    Wow, thank you very much for pointing that out and for the link to your nice article.
    Sorry I had not spotted that previously. I''ll make use of that later today, actually,
    I have a request for a little external application with a couple of buttons from
    a colleague, and I’ll create them as PNG instead of BMP, which is so much more
    sympathetic, being open.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    Actually, looking at the code in your post, I chose to update mine to include
    separate image files for the large and small images, just to keep it clean.


    I updated the downloadable source code to reflect this.


    Thanks again.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    Yes, "it could".


    You can easily translate it for yourself.


    I blogged repeatedly about how to do so.


    Cheers, Jeremy.
