  body: 'as discussed w/ Jeremy just recently, i''ll add some comments here:

    1) the first loop is NOT always the outer one, guess that''s the case for floor/roof
    too(?)

    2) i used solid/face/edge method (from Jeremy''s sample code) to get wall profile
    (include all openings) in my previous code, but now i switched to much easy one
    which will temporarily set original walls to bearing wall, then you can access
    all needed edges (wall and opening edges only) directly

    3) in some cases, you still cannot create new wall using already sorted CurveArray,
    this bring out the following questions to Autodesk:

    question 1) in which special cases that CurveArray CAN or CANNOT be used to create
    new wall?

    question 2) can wall join be accessible in API? if can, then there''s no need
    to get opening profile at all, just join new wall w/ original wall will do the
    trick.

    question 3) in general term, can we use API to do element join at project? to
    my knowledge, you can join element at family only (?)

    question 4) seems Revit''s wall "autojoin" may cause some issues, can we enable/disable
    "autojoin" in API?'

  body: "Dear Ning,\n\nSorry I was so slow in answering...\n\n1) True, we did actually\
    \ mention the fact that one may have to calculate the polygon areas to determine\
    \ which one is the outer loop:\n\n<a href=\"http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2008/12/2d-polygon-areas-and-outer-loop.html\"\

    2) That sounds very interesting! I saw from your email that you are setting the\
    \ built-in parameters WALL_STRUCTURAL_USAGE_PARAM and STRUCTURAL_ANALYTICAL_MODEL\
    \ to one before querying the geometry, and then resetting them back to zero afterwards,\
    \ but I do not actually know what the effect of this is or what you mean when\
    \ you say that this makes it easier to access the edges. Let us discuss this off-line\
    \ and maybe write a complete new post on it, please.\n\n3) I have passed on this\
    \ issue to the development team. Let's see what they say. \n\nI am also discussing\
    \ your questions with them and will let you know what we come up with.\n\nThank\
    \ you!\n\nCheers, Jeremy."

  body: 'Dear Jeremy,


    In your BuildingCoder sample, there is a function GetWallProfilePolygons() available
    to get the outer most face points of a wall. That is fine.


    When a multiple layer wall connects to another wall each layer geometry is varies.
    Is it possible to get the polygon points of each layer of a wall? Any idea please.


    Thanks and Regards,

    Rajeswara Rao'
