  body: 'Hello Jeremy,

    I noticed that there is some problem with Add-ins in Revit 2013 Ribbon. In Revit
    2013 when application starts, without opening project then add-in Ribbon is getting
    grayed out but in Revit 2011 it shows as normal. But it works properly when i
    open views other than than 3d views in Revit 2013. Is this an API issue?


    Thanks

    Sandeep'

  body: 'Hi Jeremy,


    I would prefer a developer guide in a file format because I can access the wiki
    only if I''m *online*...


    What about a new web function which allows you to download just the *current state*
    of documentation ?


    Something like "Get docu 1.2 as pdf file".

    Or as zip.

    Or as chm.


    Cheers,

    Rudolf'

    I fully agree with both your offline PDF file wish and web suggestion. Please

  body: 'Hello Jeremy,

    I successfully activate ribbon in zero document state. But when i open the document
    which is 3D perspective other than {3D} the ribbon gets disabled along with ribbon
    for "External Tools".

    Do i need to do anything else? Please suggest.


    Thanks,

    Sandeep'

    Ahmed answered his own comment... Please see his answer below, and take a look
    at the Visual Studio solution SDKSamples2013.sln in the Revit SDK.


    You can use that to compile all the samples in one single go, and then use the
    RvtSamples external application to load them all without having to install the
    add-in manifests one by one.


    I described the whole process several times in various places for the yearly updates.


    Cheers, Jeremy.
