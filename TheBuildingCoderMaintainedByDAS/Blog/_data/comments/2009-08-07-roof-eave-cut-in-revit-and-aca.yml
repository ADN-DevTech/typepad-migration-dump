  body: I'm an architecture student and I'm trying to design a roof with the edge
    cut perpendicular to the angle of the roof. The only rafter cut options I have
    are plumb cut, two cut-plumb, and two-cut square. none of them are what I'm trying
    to do. If I import a roof model that I made in sketchup with the cut the way I
    want, then I can't "attach walls to roof"

  body: Is there an online course for AutoCAD? Nowadays, more people are using this
    to lessen their time in designing. I am a Civil Engineering student and I want
    to learn AutoCAD. I think this will be taught on the 3rd year of my course but
    it is good for me to learn at this time.

  body: 'Dear Richard,


    Yes, sure, lots! You can start by checking out the AutoCAD developer page:


    <a href="http://www.autodesk.com/developautocad">http://www.autodesk.com/developautocad</a>


    Although judging from the link you attached to your name, I strongly suspect that
    you are lying and your whole comment is spam... well done, for a change.


    Cheers, Jeremy.
