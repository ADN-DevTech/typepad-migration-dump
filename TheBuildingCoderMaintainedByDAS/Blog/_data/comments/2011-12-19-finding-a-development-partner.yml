  body: As an independent software developer I'm currently working on several Revit
    Add-ins. I think small add-ins can make a big difference even for small and mid-sized
    companies. These small and mid-sized companies are a bit reluctant in starting
    the process of developing their own add-ins, therefore I've made a page on my
    website explaining how the process of developing a small custom Revit add-in looks
    like. Maybe I can take away the fear of hiring a developer for your own add-ins.
