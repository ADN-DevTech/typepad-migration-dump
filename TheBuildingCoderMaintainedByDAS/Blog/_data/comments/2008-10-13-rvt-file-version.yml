  body: 'Hi Johan,


    That is exactly the purpose of the utility I present above. I have not heard of
    any others. My RVT file version extractor is the only utility I have ever seen
    that extracts information directly from the RVT file. Currently it is in Python,
    which requires a Python runtime installation to execute the script. Installing
    that is a few clicks. If you absolutely want to avoid installing the Python runtime,
    the script can be either recompiled directly into an *.exe executable file from
    the Python source code, or it can be rewritten and compiled as an *.exe executable
    file in a different language.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'
