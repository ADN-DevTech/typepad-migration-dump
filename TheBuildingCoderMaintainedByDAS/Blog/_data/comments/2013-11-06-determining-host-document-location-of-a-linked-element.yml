    \ I had to apply a .Inverse eg.\n\n rvtlink.GetTotalTransform.Inverse\n\nI was\
    \ getting (for example) -4, -4, 0. I needed +4, +4, 0 as I am applying a transformation\
    \ to an object, rather than just getting a point.\n\nMany thanks,\nKon."

    Great, thank you, very glad you like it and it helps.


    I may have got it wrong above, maybe I need an inverse as well.


    After all, I do nothing but print the result for the subjective pleasure of the
    viewing user, no objective test, so it may be the wrong way round  :-)


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: 'Hi Jeremy, this post has been really useful to me. I have a couple of questions
    about it:

    <ol><li>I also use version 2012 of the API, how could I achieve the same with
    that version?

    </li><li>In the sample above file B contains 4 walls and a linked file (A); what
    if I had another linked file (let''s say file C) and wanted to transform the coordinate
    system from file A to file C, is that possible?

    </li>

    </ol>


    Thanks in advance!'

  body: 'Dear Emanuel,


    In principle, it should work in 2012 as well.


    Yes, sure, transforming from A to C is possible, with both being linked in to
    B.


    Determine the transformation from A''s coordinate system into B, say Ta, and C''s
    transformation into B, say Tc.


    Then you just need to calculate the inverse Tc'' of Tc, and the concatenation
    Ta * Tc''.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: 'The thing is that there is no

    ''RevitLinkInstance'' object in the

    2012 API, I do see it in the 2014

    API though.

    I will test the transformation that

    way and see how it goes. Thanks again!


    Kind regards, Emanuel.
