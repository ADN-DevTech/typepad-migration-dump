  body: 'Dear Victor,


    If you go back far enough, the developer guide used to be included in PDF format
    in the standard Revit SDK.


    Moving forward, the PDF version for the Revit 2014 API just also became available:

  body: Thank you for mentioning Comet Ison. I think it shall be remembered, not as
    the "Dud of the Decade", but as the comet that ignited the imagination of we poor
    earth dwellers- if only for a few moments.

    Yes, that was a shame, wasn''t it. I got not a single decent peek, always cloudy,
    and then that...


    And yet it made me think about the eons of time it spent getting here, and its
    bang-on precision...


    Cheers, Jeremy.
