  body: I am afraid that this pulling approach cannot give you an accurate enough
    output. There is going be occasionally inaccuracy in certain kind of elements
    (due to inaccurate tessellation the Triangulate uses), and there also may be some
    elements missing (falsely hidden) or extra elements (falsely visible). The only
    workflow guaranteed you accurate output of a model’s geometry is via the Custom
    Exporter.

  body: 'Dear Arnošt,


    Thank you very much for the warning!


    For my purposes, just viewing with zero precision or fidelity requirements, I
    am perfectly happy with this.


    For all other uses, take heed, my friends!


    Cheers, Jeremy.
