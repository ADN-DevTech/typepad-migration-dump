  body: "Dear Prasad,\n\nI am glad to hear that you solved your issue of creating\
    \ model lines. \n\nI do not believe that you can currently create filled regions\
    \ via the API. At least I see that we have an open wish list item for that functionality.\n\
    \nSorry for the bad news.\n\nCheers, Jeremy.\n-----"
