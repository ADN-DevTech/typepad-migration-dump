  body: 'Dear Angus,


    That sounds very interesting indeed! Have you used it in the context of a Revit
    add-in, or are you planning to do so? Would you like to implement a little sample
    add-in and tell us more about it?


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    No, I haven''t used Revit or its add-ins but on a little closer inspection it
    appears that these add-ins use C#, not C++. Nevertheless it would be a simple
    task to create a clipper.dll that exported 3 or 4 functions to which a Revit add-in
    could interface.

  body: 'Dear Angus,


    The Revit API is simply .NET, so you can use any language you please. I work mainly
    with C#, but other use VB.NET, maanaged C++, and other more exotic choices.


    And yes, I agree that a minimal clipper.dll exporting the required functionality
    would be the easiest and most efficient way to go.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    Thank you. I am looking forward to hearing from anyone who chooses to make use
    of this in Revit  :-)


    Cheers, Jeremy.
