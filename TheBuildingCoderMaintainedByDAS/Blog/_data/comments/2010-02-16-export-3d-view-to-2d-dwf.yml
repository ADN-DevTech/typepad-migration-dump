  body: 'Hi Sandeep,


    Correct, the Revit API DWF export options were consolidated into DWFExportOptions
    and DWFXExportOptions.


    I don''t now about the DWF selection, though.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    Thanks for quick reply. May be its true that exporting levels in DWF by manually
    also, not giving selection of Rooms. Hope we will get it next version of Revit

  body: 'Dear Sandeep,


    My pleasure. Ok, if it is not in the user interface, it will hardly happen through
    the API either. Well, please make sure it is entered in the Revit API wish list,
    then, when the time comes this year:
