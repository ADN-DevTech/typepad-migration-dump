    No, none whatsoever. I know absolutely nothing about licencing issues or trial
    versions.


    Good luck and best regards, Jeremy.'

  body: 'Brian - you possibly need to manually delete the *.dat files in C:\Documents
    and Settings\All Users\Application Data\Autodesk\Software Licenses in order to
    be able to correctly license your educational version. Beware though that this
    will wipe away ALL Autodesk licenses on your machine (and by the cryptic name
    of the *.dat files it is virtually impossible to figure out which belongs to what
    license)

    Better option may be to contact Autodesk support for help on that....'

    At the danger of being useless again, what is the Licence Transfer Utility, please?


    I am more of a programmer than a user, you know ... I know next to nothing about
    the actual usage and licensing and stuff.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: "Hi Jeremy,\n\nabout getting the serialnumerb for Revit 2012:\nI found that\
    \ when you first install Revit 2012 in demo mode (i.e. serial number = 000-0000000)\
    \ and afterwards, when you receive the box, you enter the correct serialnumber\
    \ and activate the product the licpath.lic file still contains \"SN 000-0000000\"\
    . However, when you view the Product License Information window in Revit, the\
    \ serial number is displayed correctly. \n\nDo you know where this numebr is stored\
    \ and if we can read it?\n\nThanks in advance!"

    \ mind: if you can see the final serial number in the Product License Information\
    \ window, how about doing a global search across the Windows registry and all\
    \ of your hard disk to see whether you can find it somewhere else?\n\nPlease let\
