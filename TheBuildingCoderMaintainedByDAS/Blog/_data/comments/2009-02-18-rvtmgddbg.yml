  body: This tool is invaluable, anyone who wants to develop revit API needs this
    in their toolkit. Great for testing to see if things are possible in the API.

  body: "Dear Nicholas,\n\nI'm very glad to hear you like it. It really is invaluable,\
    \ isn't it? \n\nThank you for your question. I wish myself had thought of mentioning\
    \ the meaning of the cryptic name from the beginning in the main article.\n\n\
    Rvt stands for Revit, Mgd for Managed, and Dbg for Debug. \n\nWhat Revit is we\
    \ know, more or less.\n\nManaged refers to the .NET framework, which provides\
    \ a lot of background functionality for managing memory, Windows and other system\
    \ resources, and the interaction of assemblies with each other. The extension\
    \ of C++ for working with the .NET framework is also called managed C++.\n\nDebug\
    \ or debugging is the process of removing errors, also known as bugs, from programs:\n\
    \n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debugging\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debugging</a>\n\
    \nMostly using a so-called debugger:\n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debugger\"\

    a wealth of knowledge is willing to help out others.


    I have used the Snoop tool to find a parameter called To Room and From Room from
    doors and windows.  How do I go about getting to this information for my code?


    Thanks in advance.'

  body: "Dear bfeldman,\n\nThank you for your appreciation, I'm very glad you like\
    \ it. The To Room and From Room parameters are standard Revit element parameters,\
    \ so everything we have said about them in The Building Coder Parameters category\
    \ applies, cf.\n\n<a href=\"http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/parameters.\"\
    >http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/parameters.</a>\n\nThe values stored\
    \ by these two specific parameters are element ids identifying the two rooms.\
    \ A recent example on this blog on accessing an element id valued parameter was\
    \ presented in \n\n<a href=\"http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2009/04/revit-api-cases-1.html\"\
    >http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2009/04/revit-api-cases-1.html</a>\n\
    \n  ElementId matId = dupSym.get_Parameter(\n    \"Material\" ).AsElementId();\n\
    \ \n  Material mat = doc.get_Element( ref matId )\n    as Autodesk.Revit.Elements.Material;\n\
    \nThere is not much more I can say on this topic, except recommending you to work\
    \ through the basics of Revit programming. There is a lot of advice on getting\
    \ started with the Revit API in this blog and various other online resources available.\
    \ An up-to-date overview is given in\n\n<a href=\"http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2009/04/getting-started-with-the-revit-2009-api.html\"\

  body: 'Jeremy,


    Just wondering, is the 2010 version allowed to be distributed to non ADN members?
    Is it uploaded anywhere? I would have thought it would be ok given the 2009 version
    and its source code are publicly available..


    Just thought I''d check,


    Thanks,


    Rod'

  body: 'Dear Rod,


    Thank you for asking this very pertinent question!


    The Revit 2010 version of RvtMgdDbg is included in our Revit API webcast training
    material which can be downloaded from the public ADN API training schedule site:


    <a href="http://www.adskconsulting.com/adn/cs/api_course_sched.php">http://www.adskconsulting.com/adn/cs/api_course_sched.php</a>
    > Revit API


    The direct link for this file is


    <a href="http://download.autodesk.com/media/adn/RevitAPI_2010_Webcast.zip">http://download.autodesk.com/media/adn/RevitAPI_2010_Webcast.zip</a>


    For completeness sake, here is an alternative download site for ADN members:


    <a href="http://adn.autodesk.com/adn/servlet/item?siteID=4814862&id=12264104&linkID=4901650">http://adn.autodesk.com/adn/servlet/item?siteID=4814862&id=12264104&linkID=4901650</a>


    It is thus publicly available, just like the version for Revit 2009 mentioned
    above.


    Actually, I just created a separate little post for this information to make sure
    that it gets the attention it deserves:


    <a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2009/10/rvtmgddbg-for-revit-2010.html">http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2009/10/rvtmgddbg-for-revit-2010.html</a>

  body: Can any of these commands work on a file folder of .rfa?Need to generate a
    master list of all shipped imperial content and user exposed parameters and values?
    I dont' want to have to laod and insert instances into a model to export the information.
    Must be an easier way?

    I have no idea what commands you may be referring to, and the answer is an unequivocal
    yes in any case.


    Whatever Revit API add-in you create, you can cause it to operate on an entire
    directory hierarchy of documents.
