    Do you happen to have a class that we could deserialize this information back
    to?  Say for example, if you wanted to read the xml files back into program.


    I attempted to use VS2008 to create a scheme and auto create a class with xsd.exe
    but was unsuccessful.

    No, I do not. The only experience I have with .NET and serialisation is described

    good to see we ended up with some of the same decisions.


    I believe the reason that ColumnFinish material parameter is not listed is because
    it returns an elementid and they did not want to search for the name that corresponed
    to the elementID.  I too chose not to return any paramter that returned an elementID.


    Serialization is actually really simple if you have a class to serialize.  Maybe
    after AU I can write up a simple demo for you.'

    Congratulations on that, it does indeed sound good. Yes, I as not surprisd to
    note the missing element id parameter, your explanation makes perfect sense to
    me. I agree that it is a simple schema, and a little demo is always more than
    welcome!


    Cheers, Jeremy.
