    very informative post about FamilyElementVisibility!

    I am curious if its possible to control the settings on DetailFamily Instance
    in a similar way? I am placing a detail family instance in my door family and
    i want to show the detail family only when the door is being cut, I know while
    placing this family thru UI, I can access the visibility/graphics settings and
    check the little box which says ''show only if instance is cut'', however, I can
    not access these properties programmatically, not sure what I am missing!'

  body: 'Hi Jeremy,


    I''m working with Yes/No parameters in an extension I''m writing. I added a yes\No
    parameter to the doors and added it to a schedule but it doesn''t behave as expected.


    When I first added the Yes\No parameter the column in the schedule is blank and
    the checkbox looks greyed out in the Properties palette. When I click the check
    box, the schedule shows "Yes" in the column. When I uncheck the checkbox the schedule
    shows "No" in the column. The checkbox on the properties palette looks normal
    after checking or unchecking the checkbox.


    When I set the Yes\No parameter through the API to 0 or 1 using parameter.set().
    Nothing happens.


    Is there something I''m missing with these parameters?'

    Setting the parameter value to 0 or 1 through the API should have the same result
    as checking or unchecking it through the API, afaik.


    Cheers, Jeremy.
