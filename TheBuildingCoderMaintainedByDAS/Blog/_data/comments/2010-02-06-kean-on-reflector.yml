    I am working on a project, where i need to filter and store all the elements selected
    by user in separate lists to use them for further calculations, Is there any way
    to do such to the family type level? I looked into the samples filter example,
    but unfortunately I had difficulty understanding the workflow of it. hope you
    could help me on this.

    Adi'

    There is no built-in future in the Revit API to store certain elements for future
    reference. You could easily implement your own containers, though, and store either
    element ids or unique ids in them for future reference.


    Cheers, Jeremy.
