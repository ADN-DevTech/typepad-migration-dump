    That is explained above, in the last paragraph: open the family file as a background
    document and use element filtering as normal.

  body: 'Dear Jinsol Kim,


    Yes, I would say that filtering for FamilyType objects will only work in the project
    environment. Within the family context, the family types are not represented using
    individually accessible elements at all. Instead, they are more like entries in
    a table managed by the FamilyManager class. The family manager class manages the
    family types and parameters in a family document. One of its member methods is
    DeleteCurrentType, which removes the current family type.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'
