    How can I join floor and wall geometries using Revit 2013 API ?

  body: "Dear Olivier,\n\nBasically, in many cases, Revit decides for itself which\
    \ elements are to be joined, and how.\n\nYou can only force it to perform this\
    \ calculation, but not influence the results:\n\n<a href=\"http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2010/05/autojoinelements.html\"\
    >http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2010/05/autojoinelements.html</a>\n\n\
    Some additional control was provided in Revit 2012:\n\n<a href=\"http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2013/02/whats-new-in-the-revit-2012-api.html\"\
    >http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2013/02/whats-new-in-the-revit-2012-api.html</a>\n\
    \nAllow and disallow wall end joins\n\nThe new methods\n\n- WallUtils.DisallowWallJoinAtEnd()\n\
    - WallUtils.AllowWallJoinAtEnd()\n- WallUtils.IsWallJoinAllowedAtEnd() \n\nprovide\
    \ access to the setting for whether or not joining is allowed at a particular\
    \ end of the wall. If joins exist at the end of a wall and joins are disallowed,\
    \ the walls will become disjoint. If joins are disallowed for the end of the wall,\
    \ and then the setting is toggled to allow the joins, the wall will automatically\
    \ join to its neighbors if there are any.\n\nFor beams, you can use the IExtension\
    \ property to exercise some control over how and whether they join with other\
    \ beams.\n\nFinally, the FamilyInstance.AddCoping method can be used to add a\
    \ coping (cut) to a steel beam.\n\nAfaik, this currently just about covers the\
    \ control over joining provided by the Revit API.\n\nSo joining of floor and wall\
    \ geometry is still controlled purely by Revit itself.\n\nCheers, Jeremy."

    \ (and not in any other Revit product). When a discipline's status is toggled,\
    \ Revit's UI will be adjusted, and certain operations and features will be enabled\
    \ or disabled as appropriate.\n\nIf you are not running Revit Onebox or Revit\
    \ Structure, I do not think there is anything you can do.\n\nIf it is not your\
    \ intention to create a structural plan view, then select a different view type\

  body: 'Dear Bo,


    The first question should always be: can I achieve what I want in the user interface?


    Can you create the desired floor plan manually, regardless of the API?


    Aha, yes, apparently only Revit Onebox can toggle disciplines. That makes sense,
    of course.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    I found out that in Revit Structure 2014, it won''t allow me to create Floor Plan
    from the UI but I can create Structural Plan. In Revit Architecture 2014, I can
    create Floor Plan without any problem.


    Thanks for the help.'
