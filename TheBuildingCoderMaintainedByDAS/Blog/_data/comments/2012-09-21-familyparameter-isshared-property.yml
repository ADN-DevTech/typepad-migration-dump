  body: 'Hello Jeremy,


    I don''t know where to post my question. So please forgive if it''s not the right
    place.


    My question is: does Revit API supports Walkthough (i.e. generation, edition ,
    export ...) ? I cannot find any reference in API doc, your blog, or ADN.


    P.S. I have been following your blog for about 2 years. I would say it''s  my
    Bible for Revit development :)


    Best Regards,

    David Tan'

    \ it useful.\n\nThe Revit API provides no support for walkthroughs that I am aware\
    \ of. \n\nThe Revit product does, I believe. \n\nHowever, I know nothing about\
    \ that side of things, so you will have to ask a product usage expert.\n\nCheers,\

    Thanks for your confirmation!


    Yeah, I tried Walkthrough functionality in Revit manually already (WiKiHelp is
    great!). I just wonder if there''s any API support for it. Hopefuly the next generation
    of Revit will do something there.

    Another note on this topic: please check out the RenderingSettings class and associated
    functionality that was added in the Revit 2013 API:

    Many thanks!

    It seems that there''s solution for some of my requirements. Again, hope Revit
    2014 will do more in Walkthrough.
