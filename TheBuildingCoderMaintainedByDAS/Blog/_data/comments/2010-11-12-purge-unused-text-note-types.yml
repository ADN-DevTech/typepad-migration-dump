    I am working on some project where I need to import a few .dwg files into a Revit
    family and to satisfy the need of project I have to move/translate the dwg files
    from one location to another (I can not export it with right origin point before
    it gets imported- it has to happen once its imported into the family), but unfortunately
    when I try to use "move" method, the code fails with the error saying that the
    element(in this case the imported dwg) is pinned and can not be moved. I looked
    into element.pinned property but it seems like it is a read-only property. I am
    wondering is there any way I can un-pin the drawing so that I can move it to right
    location?'

    I am sorry to say no, there is no such access in Revit 2011:

    Maybe there is some similiar approach for used line patterns? For example level
    has parameter Line Pattern, but how to get line pattern for example for reference
    plane? Is there any solution for this to get used line patterns for purge of unused?'

  body: 'Dear Sandra,


    I would explore the reference plane using RevitLookup and the built-in parameter
    checker as described in several places, e.g.


    <a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2009/04/deeper-parameter-exploration.html">http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2009/04/deeper-parameter-exploration.html</a>


    Maybe the link to the line pattern is in there somewhere, hidden in some parameter.
    If not, I assume there is no access to it.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: Hi Jeremy, Given this is an old post, is there new Purge functionality in
    2013, or is this worth a revisit? Regards, Dale
