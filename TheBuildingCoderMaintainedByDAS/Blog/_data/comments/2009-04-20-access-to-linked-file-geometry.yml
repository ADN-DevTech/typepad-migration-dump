    I hope you can give me some advise on this. Based on the information in this blog
    I was thinking of creating a separate rvt file with all our wall system families.
    Then remove the wall system families from our company template. Via the API, link
    the rvt file with all our wall system families to a project and show these walls
    in a listbox. Then add the selected walls to the Revit project for further use.


    Is there a more logic approach for this? If not is there a way to load an rvt
    file via API?

    To start at the end, yes, for sure you can load a file via the API. Do you mean
    load a family into a project? That would be an RFA file, not RVT. Do you mean
    open an existing project? That would be an RVT file. Yes, you can open a project
    in the API, but it does not become visible to the user, it can only be manipulated
    via the API.


    The rest of your ideas sound fine to me, but I am not a user, so I cannot tell
    whether the workflow is optimal. It sounds doable from the API point of view,
    as far as I can tell.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    Correct me if I''m wrong but as far as I know a System Familiy as in my case Walls
    can''t reside into a project RFA file. Therefor I thought of putting the Wall
    System Families into a RVT file and link it to a project so I can add them if
    required.


    Do you have an example of opening a project RVT file? Together with the code on
    "linked files" I can realise my idea.


    Many thanks,


    Bas'

    Oops, yes, of course, right you are, system families are built in and cannot be
    redefined in RFA files.


    You can use the Application OpenDocumentFile method to open an RVT project file.
    The only example of calling it that I found off-hand is in the FamilyCreation
    AutoParameter sample, although it is only interested in opening family files.
    It is pretty straight-forward to use.


    Cheers, Jeremy.
