    \nHow can i ensure that the new floor is joined to the same elements as the original?\n\

    I guess you mean changes, not chances, huh? Hmm, no radical changes that I can

    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    Do you know whether editing a floor opening profile is possible in 2016.

    We would like to RESIZE our elevator shaft openings.

    Any idea with regards to that?
