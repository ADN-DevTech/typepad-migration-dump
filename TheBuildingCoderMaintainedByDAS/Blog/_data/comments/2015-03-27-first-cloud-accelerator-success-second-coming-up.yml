  body: "Hi Jeremy\n\nI can't cast an Element into a View, in runtime it gives null,\
    \ here's the code:\nvar cals = originalView.GetReferenceCallouts();\n        \
    \    \nforeach (ElementId eid in cals)\n{\nElement elm = doc.GetElement(eid);\
    \ \nView vvv = elm as View;\n//rest of code\n}\n\nI'll try to send this question\
    \ through ADN as soon as I figure out the new subscription system! I need a support\
    \ ticket on how to file a support ticket!!\n\nthanks in advance"

  body: 'Dear Ammar,


    1. Check in the Visual Studio debugger what type your variable ''elm'' really
    has. That may clarify a lot.


    2. No need to submit to ADN. Submitting to the Revit API discussion forum achieves
    exactly the same thing. Unsolved ADN member requests are automatically escalated
    to ADN after a little while.


    Cheers, Jeremy.
