  body: 'Hi there Jeremy,

    i was wondering, is is possible, trough coding/making plugin, to create a linetype
    that you can use as a detail line, but this line will not be plotted ?

    this way i can use much more easy small "helping/supporting lines" without having
    to double check when plotting if i removed them all ?


    **im still not very capeble of building/coding, so in case you make this, can
    you also put up the dll file?**


    Best Regards,'

  body: 'Dear Dante,


    As stated several times in the past, the Revit API will seldom enable you to achieve
    anything that cannot be done through the user interface. So if you tell me how
    this can be achieved manually, I might be able to point you in the right direction
    to do it programmatically as well.


    Cheers, Jeremy.
