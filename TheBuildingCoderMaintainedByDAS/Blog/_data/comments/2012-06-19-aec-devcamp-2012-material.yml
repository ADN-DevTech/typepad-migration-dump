  body: 'Thank you very much for your comments on our website, ARCxl.com.  I''m a
    software developer and have been with this project since we decided to "make it
    happen" several years ago.


    One of our original ideas was to build a Revit add-in to download details from
    a web service directly within Revit itself, based on a set of selection criteria.  Although
    we ultimately chose a different direction, I found myself on your blog many, many
    times while exploring the Revit API for this original concept.


    So thanks for providing a great resource for Revit coders, and thanks again for
    mentioning us!'
