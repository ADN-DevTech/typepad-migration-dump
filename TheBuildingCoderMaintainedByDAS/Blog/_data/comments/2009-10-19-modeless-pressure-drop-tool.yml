    We do electrical power distribution and lighting. So, yes - your suggestion about
    using the tool for circuit checks would be awesome.


    Thanks,

    \ to display what circuit something is on.  I'll talk with Jeremy and see if he\

    \ you can contact me at jkarr@cadworks.net and I can see what I can do to help\

  body: 'Hi Chris and Joel,


    Thank you for picking up Joel''s suggestion. I will be very glad to publish another
    dedicated post on a separate circuit checking tool, so that those who are not
    programming savvy can simply download and use. Thank you very much Joel for the
    offer!


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    Thank you for the tool. We are trying to tie it to our need. It works, but the
    result number we can''t understand. What are units for it?


    Thank  you.

  body: "Dear Evgeny,\n\nOne way to find out is to look at the source code. \n\nAnother\
    \ way is to look at the element properties in the user interface. I would assume\
    \ that the units are displayed in the built-in Revit database units.\n\nIf you\
    \ would prefer them in some other unit, that would be very easy to achieve. Simply\
    \ determine the appropriate factor and multiply the value before displaying it.\n\
    \nThe appropriate factor can be determined by setting something to 1 of your desired\
    \ units in the user interface, and then using RevitLookup to find out what the\
    \ underlying database value is.\n\nCheers, Jeremy.\n-----"
