    happy new year, too.


    As far as I can see, BuiltInCategory.OST_Planting doesn''t have Material quantities.

    If there are some trees in the Document, they won''t be hidden but also exported.

    There may be other Categories which may also show this behaviour.


    Cheers,

    Rudolf'

    If you simply specify the view element id as well as the document in the FilteredElementCollector
    constructor, it should give you what you are looking for.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: 'Dear Rudolf,


    Thank you for your good wishes and for pointing this out this very useful aspect.


    Yes, I guess there is simply no single solution that fits all needs, and you will
    have to test for yourself to find a solution that returns exactly those elements
    you are interested in.


    Cheers, Jeremy.
