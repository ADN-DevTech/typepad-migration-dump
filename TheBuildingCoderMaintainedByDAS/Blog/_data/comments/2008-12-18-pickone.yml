  body: 'If you use PickOne rather then window select then you know that there is
    only one element selected. Is there a way to efficiently get at the single selected
    element, rather then using for each? Here what I''ve been doing:



    ElementSetIterator elemIter;

    Element pickedElement


    //clears the current selection

    doc.Selection.Elements.Clear();


    //prompts the user to select an element

    doc.Selection.StatusbarTip = "Please select an object";


    //checks if the user hit escape

    if (doc.Selection.PickOne() == false)

    {

    return IExternalCommand.Result.Cancelled;

    }


    //Creates an element iterator

    elemIter = doc.Selection.Elements.ForwardIterator();


    //move to the first item

    elemIter.MoveNext();


    //Assigns pickedElement

    pickedElement = elemIter.Current as Autodesk.Revit.Element;


    What I really want to do is reference the single selected object in one line.
    Something like.


    Element pickedElement = doc.Selection.Elements[0];'

  body: 'Hi Eric,


    Your query makes perfect sense, but I am not aware of any other method to get
    at the member elements in the document selection set. The only access to member
    elements provided by the SelElementSet class and its base class ElementSet are
    through the ForwardIterator and GetEnumerator members, which both return a forward
    moving iterator to the set. There is no indexed access.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: 'Hi Jeremy,

    I am a beginner at Revit API (C#). I am trying to isolate/hide selected elements
    but I couldn''t find out the function to do it. Could you show me the way to solve
    this problem? Thank you in advance.

  body: 'Dear Trang,


    The Revit SDK VisibilityControl sample shows how to control visibility by category.


    To control the visibility of individual selected elements, you can use the View.Hide
    Method and pass in selected elements to be hidden in the view.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: "Hi Jeremy,\n\nI still have a problem with the ActiveView. I can hide selected\
    \ elements directly in Commands (inherited from IExternalCommand), but I can't\
    \ if I use a userform to interact with Revit. \nIt is so, I have a form and a\
    \ button on it. When I click the button, I can read attributes of selected elements\
    \ but I can't hide them. \nI don't know if I must activate the ActiveView again\
    \ before I want to hide elements. And if that is necessary, I also don't know\
    \ how to do that. I tried but  I couldn't find it out.\n\nThanks.\nTrang."

    everything now is OK, Tim in AUGI forum showed me. I didn''t use Transaction and
    maybe, that was the reason; when I add Transaction, it works :D
