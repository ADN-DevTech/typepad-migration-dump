    It seems that Update 2 is available only if the English language is selected on
    the first step.


    Do you know if the Update 2 from the English page will work with the localised
    versions (French as the matter of fact) or we have to wait until localised version
    of Update 2 will be available ?


    Thanks in advance and have a great weekend,


    Constantin'

    To date, the update is not installing the shared updated content as documented.


    I understand someone may be working on making those updated files available to
    us. Haven''t seen them as yet though, so I''m hoping I don''t really need them
    until they become available.'

  body: 'Richard,


    Revit 2012 Update Release 2 contains all the fixes, in product and content, that
    Revit 2012 Update Release 1 provided. This is done to allow you to install just
    UR2 on the release version. With that said, if you installed UR1 and only have
    English content installed, then you would not see any further content updates.
    Most of the content updates from UR1 to UR2 were around templates for European
    Countries.


    I hope this helps,

  body: 'Jeremy,

    I just want to comment on what you mentioned regarding updates.  You said: "A
    few days ago, I was very surprised to hear that some people neglect to update
    their Revit products when intermediate updates appear. I find that incomprehensible.
    I updated all three flavours myself yesterday with zero hassle."


    I am happy you were able to update with zero hassle, but this does not hold true
    for most of us.

    I have spent the last three hours trying to get updated.  First the Live update
    feature choked.  It''s a joke to say the least.  It spent 45 minutes and two reboots
    trying to verify my software and another 30 minutes trying to download the update
    before giving me an error.

    The Autodesk website is all but worthless as it would not give enough information
    to grab an update and go with it.  I had to come to your blog to get the info
    I needed.

    My machine was built from an Autodesk Reseller and they installed the software
    we need.  But Autodesks software requires the "original" install package, so I
    had to rebuild my machine because I don''t have their downloaded "quick install"
    software, I have the CD''s.

    This is extremely frustrating and really not worth the three-plus hours this has
    currently taken.  No, it is not incomprehensible to not update, what is incomprehensible
    is the amount of hoops and hassles and time lost just to update.


    So, there''s my 2c vent.'

  body: 'Aaron,


    I am sorry you have had so much trouble installing the Update Release to your
    system.  It is important for Autodesk to hear this kind of feedback so we understand
    how this affects your work.  We have recently made change to the software update
    process of Revit.  In the past the entire application needed to be re-installed
    to get an update.  Now we have the update releases where this is not required.  It
    appears from your story we still have some work to do to get this process smoother
    for our customers.  Thank you for sharing your story.  I will pass this along
    to the Revit team so we can continue to work on making the update process smoother.'

  body: 'Dear Afshin,


    I am sorry to say that the Revit API does not provide any functionality supporting
    this.


    All I can suggest is to use the .NET System.Windows.Forms libraries, which go
    beyond the Revit API. Their use is not explicitly supported by the Revit API,
    though, so you are on your own with that from my point of view.


    Also, I would suggest that you be very careful to design your Revit add-ins so
    that they integrate easily into the Revit user interface, without disrupting the
    look and feel or surprising the user. Therefore, if you decide to create your
    own type of dockable add-in form, I would take care to retain the look and feel
    of the existing standard Revit user interface.


    By the way, the Revit SDK sample PowerCircuit does demonstrate a simple use of
    a non-docking control bar.


    Cheers, Jeremy.
