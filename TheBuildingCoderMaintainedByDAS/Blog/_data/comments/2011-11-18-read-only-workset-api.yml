  body: 'Hello Jeremy,


    Do you know of a way to assign worksets to content within the project? If there
    is could you provide the code for this?  If there isn''t do you know of a work
    around to achieve the same outcome?'

  body: "Dear Liono,\n\nI have no code nor experience with this, but it sure looks\
    \ doable just perusing the Revit API help file. \n\nYou can see the Workset class\
    \ in there, and worksets have WorksetId identifiers, even though they are not\
    \ element ids, and the Element class has a WorksetId property, so it all looks\
    \ nicely doable. \n\nI'll let you provide the code.\n\nCheers, Jeremy.\n-----"
