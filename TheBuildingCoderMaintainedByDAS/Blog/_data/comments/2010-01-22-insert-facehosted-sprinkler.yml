    For that, you are dealing with the Revit database unit for length measurement,
    which is feet.


    We have dealt with that issue numerous times in the past. An overview of some
    of the posts is provided in

  body: 'Hi Jeremy, thanks for so much quality info on this blog.


    Im struggling to place face-based families. Ive managed to place the families
    on reference faces (rather than instance geometry), access the instance Transform
    information, but the examples Ive found on here apply the transformation to the
    individual Vertices of faces and edges - Which I cant get working.


    Am I on the right track? After placing a face-based family on a reference face,
    how do I apply the correct Transformation?
