  body: 'Hi Jeremy I thought I''d let you know of something I found a little while
    ago while participating in this thread: <a href="http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/Revit-API/Add-button-to-existing-ribbon-panel/td-p/4981498/highlight/true/page/2">http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/Revit-API/Add-button-to-existing-ribbon-panel/td-p/4981498/highlight/true/page/2</a>


    Basically, there is a way of adding your own custom panels / buttons to the system
    tabs and have them behave as standard command buttons with full API access, no
    need for Idling callbacks and other stuff.


    My brief explanation from the thread is copied below.


    "

    If you add your command button using standard API methods to its own ribbon panel
    on either your own tab or the built in add-ins tab, you can then find the panel
    using the above methods and insert it into any of the system tabs (using Autodesk.Windows.RibbonTab.Panels.Add())
    . The button will then behave in the same way as it would on the original tab
    and the API doesn''t seem to notice (well to the extent of my brief testing anyway).
    You can then remove the panel from the addins tab if desired and the panel will
    remain happily in its new home.

    "


    If you are interested in seeing this in action I can knock up a demo for you to
    share.'

    Wow, cool, sounds too good to be true.


    I never cease to be amazed by the workarounds you come up with.


    By the way, the link you provide above does not work for me, but this simpler
    ones does:

    Yes, I would love to see that in action, and happily publish it as an important
    enhancement and simplification of the approach described above.


    Thank you!


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    Thank you very much, will do.


    Do you have anything to add to the description and what you already said?


    Otherwise, I''ll simply grab the blurb for the post from there.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'
