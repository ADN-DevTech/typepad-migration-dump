    Document.NewElbowFitting, for two connectors that are close enough (e.g. almost
    the same point / exactly the same point) instead of using Connector.ConnectTo.


    Exception will be thrown if it cannot create the fitting under some conditions,
    e.g. angle is too large or too small.


    If the segment is too short, no exception will be thrown but an error message
    in the Revit will pop-up.


    The above comment is based on my experience in using Revit2013.'

    Thank you ever so much for this reminder!


    I completely forgot about that possibility.


    I just implemented it the hard way instead, selecting, dimensioning, placing and
    orienting the two appropriate fittings myself, and then using them to define the
    location of the rolling offset pipe segment:

    Your suggestion will vastly simplify this, since all of the complex steps listed
    above are then handled completely automatically by Revit instead.


    Thank you!


    Cheers, Jeremy.
