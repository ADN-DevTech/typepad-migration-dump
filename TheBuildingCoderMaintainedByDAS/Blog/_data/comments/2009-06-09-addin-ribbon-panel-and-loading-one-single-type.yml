  body: 'Hi Jeremy,

    I''ve looked around and haven''t found a way to do this yet. As we''ve been creating
    content for Revit, we''ve been saving our Symbols/Types into a txt file.  LoadFamilySymbol
    works great if the Revit Types are built into the rfa file but when they are separated
    out into a txt file, it doesn''t work.  Is there a way to load a single family
    when they are separated out into a txt file?

    Thanks for time/assistance!!

    Matt'

    \ problems with the TX file would be to just define one single type in the RFA\

  body: 'Dear Jeremy,

    I have been trying to load a family type and then create an instance of that family
    type but I can''t get pass of the FamilySymbol issue. How do I get this object?
    I want to insert isolated foundations "M_Pile Cap-Rectangular : 1400 x 1300 x
    350mm". How do I get the FamilySymbol for this? I have been going through your
    blog, API Labs and the Developer Guide and I can''t find an answer.

    Thank you.


    Best regards,

  body: 'Dear Vasco,


    You will definitely need to hone up your searching skills a bit.


    How about using the GetFirstFamilySymbol method in this recent post as a starting
    point:


    <a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2010/06/set-tag-type.html">http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2010/06/set-tag-type.html</a>


    If you need to search for the symbol by name, there are several previous posts
    which show exactly how to do this.


    Cheers, Jeremy.
