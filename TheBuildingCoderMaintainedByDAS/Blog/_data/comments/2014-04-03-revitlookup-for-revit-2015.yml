    Why is it that RevitLookup is not longer included, now that a lot of developers
    use it?


    The actual question:

    I have tried to implement RevitLookup but without any success. I followed Troy
    Gates link:

    <a href="http://revitcoaster.blogspot.dk/2014/06/revit-lookup-2015-addin.html">http://revitcoaster.blogspot.dk/2014/06/revit-lookup-2015-addin.html</a>

    and has given me the following error when launching Revit 2015:

    Revit cannot run the external application "RevitLookup"


    System.IO.FileLoadExecption


    Could not load file or assembly

    ......\RevitLookup.dll or one of its dependencies. Operation is not supported.
    (Exeption from HRESULT: 0x80131515)



    I have also tried implementing your repository along with the files from Troy
    and still without any success. Can you give my any advice on how to fix this?'

    RevitLookup is no longer included in the Revit SDK for the simple reason to make
    it easier for all users of it to add their improvements to it.


    It is now hosted on GitHub, at


    <a href="https://github.com/jeremytammik/RevitLookup">https://github.com/jeremytammik/RevitLookup</a>


    The current release is 2015.0.0.4:


    <a href="https://github.com/jeremytammik/RevitLookup/releases/tag/2015.0.0.4">https://github.com/jeremytammik/RevitLookup/releases/tag/2015.0.0.4</a>


    By coincidence, a new enhancement was added just today.


    This enhancement is not included in the latest release.


    To get the latest and greatest, simply clone the master branch.


    I hope this clarifies.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: 'Hi Jeremy,


    I followed your instructions on how to migrate Revit Lookup to 2015, and I get
    around 80 errors. Some of the classes that were not recognized are "WallFoundation",
    "ParameterElement", "SharedParameterElement",etc. I replaced the RevitAPI.dll
    and RevitAPIUI.dll references and I changed the .NET framework to 4.5. Can you
    please help me out with this.


    Thanks in advance,

    Peace'

    I just updated RevitLookup to compile with Revit 2016.


    To grab a version for Revit 2015, do not clone from the latest master.


    Go to the list of releases instead, and grab the latest Revit 2015 version:
