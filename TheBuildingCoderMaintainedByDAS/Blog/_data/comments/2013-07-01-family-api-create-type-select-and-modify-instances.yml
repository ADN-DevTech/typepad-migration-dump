  body: 'Hi Jeremy,


    I am a new student of Revit API and your blog is being extremmelly helpfull for
    me. At the moment I am trying to make my addon to change the Family type of an
    element but I have had no luck so far. My problem is: I have two types of Bends
    in Pipe Fittings and would like that my program change the bend in the project
    according a condition I am giving through the interface I created. To retrieve
    the type from an element is a kind of a simple process but how I set a new type
    to an element?(bend 2 replacing bend 1 for instance)


    Thanks in advance'

  body: 'Dear Fábio,


    Thank you for your appreciation and congratulations on the good progress you are
    making.


    You can change the type of a family instance by setting the FamilyInstance.Symbol
    property.


    That is very simple as well, actually.


    Cheers, Jeremy.
