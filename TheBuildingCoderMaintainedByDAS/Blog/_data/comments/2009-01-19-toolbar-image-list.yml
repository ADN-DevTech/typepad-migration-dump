  body: 'Hi Farid,


    I would suggest asking that question in a discussion group on AutoCAD API, or
    on Kean''s blog, which deals with AutoCAD.NET:


    <a href="http://discussion.autodesk.com">http://discussion.autodesk.com</a> >
    AutoCAD


    <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com">http://through-the-interface.typepad.com</a>


    The topic of this blog is the Revit API.


    Cheers, Jeremy.
