  body: 'Dear Stamen,


    As Visual Studio projects go, this one is pretty small, really. The main action
    is in the C# files, with a filename extension of cs. It is easiest to understand
    if you open the project in Visual Studio, compile and debug it.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: I second that!! As a fellow blogger I realize how time consuming blogging
    is and Jeremy you put in a lot of time into this blog. It is a great plethora
    of Revit API knowledge, thank you for all your time and hard work you put in here
    to share your knowledge!
