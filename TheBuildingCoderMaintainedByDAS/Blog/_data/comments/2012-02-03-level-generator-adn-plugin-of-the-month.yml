  body: "Hey Jeremy, I posted this to the discussion.autodesk.com, but thought you\
    \ might have more insight:\n\n1. If I create a Level using ...Create.NewLevel(elevation),\
    \ it creates a Level with some default X-Y extents.  Is there a way to programmatically\
    \ change the extents?\n \n2. I can get an Elevation marker (Category = \"Elevations\"\
    ), but I can't seem to get its coordinates.  For example, its Location as LocationPoint\
    \ (or LocationCurve for that matter) is null.  I can move it, but I want to find\
    \ its original position first.\n\nThanks in advance, Chuck\n-----"
