  body: "Jeremy,\n\nSorry for using that silly please, it is just that I spend all\
    \ this time in the past few weeks writing code for Selection and Printing tools,\
    \ suffering was with me all along until with your help and experimenting I got\
    \ the plotting and selection to work fine. The changes they made to the API took\
    \ me back to where I started.  Nothing is working on API 2010.  you can understand\
    \ my frustration.\n\nback to this problem:\nI have a code that is the same as\
    \ yours.  I also have the last statement \ndoc.Selection.Elements = selElements;\n\
    if you degug it, the Selection.Elements is not empty.  However, on the screen,\
    \ nothing is selected.\n\nHere is what I found today:  if I use the pan command\
    \ and move the building, it colors the elements to be selected with Red (my selection\
    \ color) but still I can get either of the following:\n\n1. No Contextual menu\
    \ appears, i.e. I can't do anything to the selected elements (makes it useless)\n\
    2. I don't get the Element Properties command, as if nothing is selected.\n\n\
    Is there any extra code we have to write for Revit 2010 to give us the complete\
    \ selection expectations\n\nThanks again,\nNadim"

    As I have probably said before, if you are doing this professionally, I strongly
    suggest you join ADN:


    <a href="http://www.autodesk.com/joinadn">http://www.autodesk.com/joinadn</a>


    If you do not want to do so, there are other forums where you can discuss with
    your peers:

    I am happy to answer any question when I can.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: 'Thanks anyway, you''re doing a good job.


    To answer your question, no I am not doing this professionaly, because I am a
    Structural Engineer and not a programmer.  I just have some overhead time and
    I spend on the API.


    I wish we can join ADN; however, we do not meet the requirments to joint.


    The reason I posted back to you is that It was obvious the issues I am having
    are because of bugs they introduced to Revit 2010.  Just by installing Web Update
    2 fixed half of my problems in all the commands I created.  It would be great
    to know if I have to wait for another update for my code to work again or try
    to figure it out my self?


    Thanks anyway.

    I am not aware of any requirements to join ADN, it is open to anybody interested
    in using Autodesk APIs.

  body: 'Jeremy,


    After enough research and testing, I found that the selection example in the manual
    is actually having the same problem my code has. Which is: it selects the elements
    and it provides the contextual menu, but it would not give access to element properties
    like it does with the UI.


    If the code in the Revit Manual is not working, then I gave up.

    I am very humbled by your statement.  I will never know more than you do.  Your
    blog was a savior for me.


    I am just a structural engineer, and I am just trying to use my time in something
    meaningful as we don''t have much engineering work to do :)  (The current economy
    story)


    Please don''t treat me as a professional programmer because I am not.  Until recently,
    I only knew VB6.  I am new to the .NET, and thanks to you, I shifted to using
    C# because your examples are in C#, and I love it.


    Please keep the good work as amateurs like me need your help.

  body: "Feedback on RevitAPI 2010:\n\nAfter I finished fixing my external application,\
    \ I have the following feedback on two issues with RevitAPI 2010.\n\n1. The selection\
    \ commands do not seem to work properly.  \nSometimes the elements are not highlighted,\
    \ I worked around that by adding elementSet.Hide() and then elementSet.Unhide()\
    \ methods to get elements highlighted always.\n\nContextual menu is showing now\
    \ after installing the Revit Web Updates.\n\nAccess to the Element Properties\
    \ of selected element is NOT possible (unline Revit 2009), no work around in the\
    \ code.  At the user interface, I have to move the selected elements a zero distance\
    \ and I would get the access to the properties.\n\n2. Print Project Sheets\n\n\
    no matter what you do, ptManager.SubmitPrint() will always print the sheets in\
    \ the order they are created.  I guess that Revit sorts ViewSets internally by\
    \ the element id. Don't waste your time trying to implement a custom IComparer\
    \ to compare ViewSheets by their names, it will not do it.\nThe work around is\
    \ to save the names of the views in a Generic List and then sort it.  Then send\
    \ sheets one at the time in the the sequence of the sorted List.\n\nRegards,\n\

  body: 'Hello Jeremy,


    I''m brazilian, 22 years old and need some help with Revit API.


    My question is: how can I retrieve the elements on the same order that I''ve selected?


    I''m doing a foreach, and the order of sellection (sellecion.Elements) is by ElementId.


    Is there a way to retrieve the Elements in order I selected?


    Thank you.


    PS: Please, forgive my language mistakes. I''m not fluent in english.'

  body: 'Dear Vitor,


    Your English is perfectly fine, no need whatsoever to apologise or worry about
    it.


    If you select elements in bulk there is no control over the selection order.


    If you need control over the selection order, you can implement a loop using the
    Revit API picking them one at a time, putting them into a sorted collection that
    you have total control over.


    Cheers, Jeremy.
