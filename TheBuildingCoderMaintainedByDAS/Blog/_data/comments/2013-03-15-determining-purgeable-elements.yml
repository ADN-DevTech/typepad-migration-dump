  body: 'Actually, the best way to approach purging is to ask the Revit Development
    Team for providing a Purging API. If enough customers ask for it, it will be added,
    eventually. In the meantime various techniques can be used, but none can do exactly
    what Revit does. There is a danger in purging anything that appears unused, because
    often unused types and other elements need to be present in order for Revit function
    correctly (e.g. when certain edit modes or sketches start). Removing those essential
    elements could lead to undesirable problems.

  body: 'Amen!

    Where can I send a request? I totally agree that replicating native purging functionality
    gets cumbersome. Purging API would be a great addition, because a lot of people
    write custom and very specific to their company tools to exchange / prepare models
    for sharing and purging is ALWAYS a big part of this procedure!'

  body: "Dear Dima,\n\nIf it can be simply described using text only, you can just\
    \ submit a comment requesting it right here.\n\nSlightly more officially, you\
    \ can submit it to an Autodesk discussion forum.\n\nFor a totally official one,\
    \ you can submit an ADN DevHelp case, if you are a member.\n\nAUGI also manages\
    \ a wishlist which is taken very seriously by Autodesk.\n\nIf it not possible\
    \ or easy to describe you request in just simple text, you should create a more\
    \ detailed description, possibly including images, sample code, a minimal sample\
    \ model etc. There are various places you can post such material on the Internet\
    \ and include a link to it in your submission.\n\nWe often need a reproducible\
    \ case to discover an error, i.e. \n\n- Detailed step-by-step instructions for\
    \ reproducing the issue.\n\n- Specification of the exact behaviour you observe\
    \ versus what you expect.\n\n- A complete yet minimal Revit sample model to run\
    \ a test in.\n\n- A complete yet minimal Visual Studio solution with add-in manifest\
    \ so that we can compile, load and run the application with a single click and\
    \ explore its behaviour live in the sample model you provide.\n\nI hope this helps.\n\
    \nCheers, Jeremy."

  body: "Hi Jeremmy,\ncould you explain what this...\ndoc.GetUnusedFamilies()\n\n\
    is it a return reference for a list of ElementIds that can be purged? If so how\
    \ can it be an extension method that is not recognised by the Revit API and yet\
    \ grabs the Document doc handle? I am a little confused.\nmany thanx fabs\n\n\

  body: "Dear Frank,\n\nNo idea whatsoever.\n\nWhere did you get that from?\n\nWhat\
    \ gave you the idea to ask me?\n\nIt does indeed look like a couple of extension\
    \ methods that somebody added to the Document class.\n\nIt also looks a little\
    \ bit old-fashioned...\n\nYou do know what extension methods are, don't you? \n\
    \nAnybody can create one, on any class, e.g. like this:\n\n<a href=\"http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2010/02/getpolygon-extension-methods.html\"\
    >http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2010/02/getpolygon-extension-methods.html</a>\n\
    \nHere is a rather more recent example:\n\n<a href=\"http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2014/12/selfilter-a-powerful-generic-selection-filter-utility.html\"\
