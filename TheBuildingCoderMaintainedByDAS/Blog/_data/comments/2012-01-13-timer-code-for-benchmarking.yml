    As I understand the courses you pointed out is for beginning Revit API users.
    Can you tell me if exists courses for intermediate or advanced users?


    Regards, Victor.'

  body: 'Dear Victor,


    Yes, you are right, the scheduled courses are mostly for beginners, and do not
    go very far beyond the ''My First Plugin'' and DevTV recording topics.


    We very happily provide more advanced courses as well. That often happens due
    to a request from a specific company or a local Autodesk office that has a group
    of developers interested in some advanced API topics.


    You can try talking with some colleagues or with your local Autodesk office to
    see whether there is enough interest to arrange something, and what topics such
    a course should cover.


    Cheers, Jeremy.
