    Sure, I would love to. Please submit an ADN case for that, so that I can take
    some time to dig in deeper and also ensure that the issue gets logged and tracked
    in our knowledge base. Thank you!

  body: 'Jeremy,

    looks like you had some fun drawing the many lines between 32 and 64bit development
    in Revit.

    I have a 64bit win7 system and literally just threw 4 hours away trying to reference
    a web-reference into my Revit 2011 VSTA project. This works fine in 32bit (on
    my old crappy laptop that I sooo wanted to throw out of the window) but imediately
    flags out in 64bit, as in "An attempt was made to load a program with an incorrect
    format..." for the revitapi.dll.

    Any suggestions? Any help would be greatly appreciated. I''m stuck...

    Kind regards,

    Gregor'
