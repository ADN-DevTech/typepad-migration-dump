    Hope you''re fine.


    When I create a panel on the OnStartup event, it works.

    But, after modifying a Family, the panel is unloaded.

    Do you have a solution for it?


    Cheers!'

  body: 'Hello Jeremy,


    The first thing that my compagny ask me to create, is a special TAB in REVIT.

    I use revit structure 2012. I try to create a revit ribbon tab. The tab and panel
    appear, but I have not the Ferrari ! In the stacktrace I saw problem in createButton
    call by ribbonpanel.additem : parentID could not be null or empty.

    If you have an idea.

    Thank you.

    Congratulations on getting the tab and panel to appear.


    Samples of adding buttons are provided by the Revit SDK Ribbon sample. A simple
    minimal sample is also given by

    A more complex sample including image handling is provided by the string search
    plugin of the month:
