  body: 'Dear Cosmas,


    First of all, you should consult with a product expert to be absolutely sure that
    you are using the family symbol for its intended purpose in the intended way.


    In Revit 2013, the new Family.PlacementType property provides information about
    the placement type for instances of the given family, and roughly maps to the
    proper NewFamilyInstance overload to use for that family.


    Some instances always insert on a specific level, and then support an offset parameter
    to move them up or down.


    How is this specific symbol manipulated in the user interface?


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: Hello Jeremy and thank you for your prompt answer. Yes I am a structural engineer
    and the base plates are supposed to be placed only on the top face of a footing.
    When I insert the base plate manually in the user interface, it correctly slides
    on the faces of a footing at any elevation. But when I insert it using the programming
    interface it only slides horizontally on an invisible face that is at Elevation=0
    even though I have tried to host it on a footing that is at a non zero elevation.
    When I try to change its Elevation parameter programmatically I get a read only
    error. Offset parameter does not do anything either. When I try to move manually
    a programmatically inserted base plate, it does not move out of that 0 Elevation
    up or down (it only moves horizontally). I have noticed in the family editor of
    that base plate (in the user interface) that the base plate is drawn together
    with its footing even though that footing is not inserted.

  body: 'Hello Jeremy

    Tha BasePlate family symbol is WorkPlaneBased. How do you change the workplane
    elevation to place the BasePlate at the desired elevation using NewFamilyInstance?'

  body: 'Hello Jeremy,

    I am still not able to figure out why this particular FamilySymbol (Structural
    Connections\Steel\Column Base Plate-4 Hole-Cross.rfa) is always placed at the
    zero Elevation and its Elevation can not change. I have tried other Structural
    Connections and I can easily insert them at the desired Elevation using any of
    the Create.NewFamilyInstance methods. Its Family.PlacementType is WorkPlane based
    and even when I change the WorkPlane Elevation to a non zero value, this instance
    is still placed at Elevation zero!'

  body: 'Dear Cosmas,


    Sorry to hear that this is still an issue for you.


    I asked the development team about this, and they reply:


    Usually it happens because of a content problem. Most likely geometry inside a
    family is not constrained to base level.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    I will keep trying and let you know if I resolve it.
