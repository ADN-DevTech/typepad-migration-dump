    Could you point me in the right direction?

    The SDK for Robot Structural Analysis RSA is public and available from the RSA
    installation DVD under \\DVD\support\SDK. So if you have RSA installed, it should
    be right there at your finger tips.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    I have one more question though. I have RSA 2011 x64 but when I try to install
    the SDK from ''RSA_SDK.exe'' it says that it can''t find RSA installed. Do I have
    to install the 32bit version?

    Thank you!'

    It tells me that I don''t have RSA installed either, even though I am on a 32
    bit system. In my case, however, that is true  :-)


    Sorry, I cannot tell you anything more. Please try it out and let us know. Thank
    you!


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    It seems that for now the SDK does not work with the 64bit version of the RSA.
    There are no issues with the 32bit version so there''s little to worry about.

    I would like to develop an RSA solution that is complied in Visual Studio and
    then executed on different machines. How do I deal with library references? Obviously
    the .dll''s are not guaranteed to be in the same location on every machine...

    Thanks in advance,'

  body: 'Dear Konstantin,


    I should think that there are a number of possible solutions.


    The simplest thing to do is probably to copy all the required assemblies to the
    same location as the add-in executable on each machine.


    Hopefully, they are not used by several different clients.


    Cheers, Jeremy.
