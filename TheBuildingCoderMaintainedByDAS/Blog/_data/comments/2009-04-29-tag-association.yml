  body: "Hi\nHow are you? As you know, Cruz y Dávila Ingenieros Consultores (the company\
    \ where I’m working in), has been developing engineering projects in the Revit\
    \ platform and we are beginning with some little programming but we have met with\
    \ some doubts and questions. Hence, I would like to ask you some question regarding\
    \ with revit programming. Here they are:\n\nREVIT PROGRAMMING - Macros\n\n1.\t\
    How is the process of invoking the tag events and their corresponding elements.\n\
    2.\tHow can we access to the tag revisions and its attributes. (sheet issues/revisions).\n\
    3.\tHow to create a new tag from c sharp? And assign it to a specific position\
    \ in a plane.\n4.\tIs it possible to get some further or additional information\
    \ about these aspects and some examples of implementation?\n\nBest Regards"

  body: "Dear Rodrigo,\n\nI am fine, I hope you are as well.\n\nThe short answer to\
    \ your question is: search the Revit SDK documentation and samples and the blog\
    \ and the additional resources they mention, as mentioned in\n\n<a href=\"http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2009/02/creating-a-group-and-how-to-fish.html\"\
    >http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2009/02/creating-a-group-and-how-to-fish.html</a>\n\
    \nWell, just because it is you, here is a slightly more detailed answer:\n\nI\
    \ obviously do not know off-hand how to extract the data you need or whether it\
    \ is possible at all, and would need to explore it myself to find out.\n\nI have\
    \ described a few examples of such explorations in previous blog posts in an attempt\
    \ at teaching people how to fish instead of just feeding them and keeping them\
    \ stupid.\n\nOne way to explore these kinds of issues is to build a sample model\
    \ and use debugging and analysis tools such as RvtMgdDbg, the element lister and\
    \ the built-in parameter checker. Some posts describing their use are\n\n<a href=\"\

    >http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2009/02/locked-dimensioning.html</a>\n\
    \nPlease dig into this a bit and let us know if you hit any insurmountable obstacles.\
    \ \n\nFor creating new tag elements in C# and regarding further information and\
    \ programming examples, you can look at the Revit SDK samples AutoTagRooms and\
    \ TagBeam, the Revit API introduction lab Lab2_0_CreateLittleHouse, and also several\
    \ examples in the Revit SDK developer guide 'Revit 2010 API Developer Guide.pdf'.\n\
    \nCheers, Jeremy."

  body: 'Dear Olli,


    Yes, indeed we now do, and isn''t that great?


    I am not aware of any method to control the "active" tag of a category via API,
    though.


    Please submit a DevHelp Online request for us to add a wish list item to the database.


    Thank you!


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: "Jeremy pointed out to me that in 2012, we can now do this:\n\nIndependentTag\n\
    \nSome new members were added to determine the elements referenced by the tag:\n\
    •\tNew property TaggedElementId - provides the id of the element referenced by\
    \ the tag. \n•\tNew property TaggedLocalElementId - provides the id of a linked\
    \ element reference by the tag. \n•\tNew method GetTaggedLocalElement() - returns\
    \ the handle of the element reference by the tag. \n•\tNew property IsOrphaned\
    \ - Orphans are those tags that are associated with an instance of a linked Revit\
    \ file but have no host element. Tags become orphaned when the element they were\
    \ tagging was deleted from the link. \n\n-----"
