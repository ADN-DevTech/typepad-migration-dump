    \ look for the first value stored in the UIViews collection of the UIDocument\
    \ \n\nif(uiDoc.ActiveView.ViewType == ViewType.ProjectBrowser)\n{\n   uiDoc.ActiveView\
    \ = (View)doc.GetElement(uiDoc.GetOpenUIViews().First().ViewId);\n}\n\nAs far\
    \ as I can tell this collection is re-built each time the active view is changed,\
    \ with the active view as the first in the collection, however the UIViews collection\
    \ isn't re-build when the project browser is activated. Having said this your\
    \ method is a lot \"safer\" and more robust so even though I haven’t come across\
    \ any problems using my method I might switch to a version of your method. \n\n\
    Thanks for the post."

  body: 'Dear James,


    Thank you very much for that very cool and interesting observation, and for your
    appreciation.


    Wow. Yes, definitely lower overhead, definitely higher risk  :-)


    It also proves that Matt is not the only one encountering this need.


    I would also recommend switching to his solution, though.


    You could implement both, side-by-side, add an assertion ensuring that the result
    is identical, and use the non-debug version when speed is of the essence.


    Cheers, Jeremy.
