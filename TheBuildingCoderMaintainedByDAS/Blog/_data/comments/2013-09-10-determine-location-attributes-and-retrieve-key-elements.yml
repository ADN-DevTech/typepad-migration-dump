  body: 'Hi Jeremy,


    Excuse me please for asking here about a different topic, but I don''t know any
    other email address where I could ask different questions from time to time.


    I would like to know if there is any possibility (API or not) that I could define
    a shared parameter and then somehow display it in different languages depending
    upon the Revit language (like in French for French Revit and in English for the
    English version of Revit).


    This would be something similar to Revit built-in SHEET_SCALE built-in parameter
    which is displayed Échelle in French and Scale in English.


    Thank you for your attention,


    Constantin'

  body: 'Dear Constantin,


    Thank you, cool question.


    Unfortunately, I am not aware of any such functionality, whether API or not.


    I have heard of developers defining different shared parameter text files reusing
    the same shared parameter GUID for different languages, but that is a bit different.


    A Revit add-in can be internationalised and localised by using resource DLLs,
    and these can also be specified via the add-in manifest.


    None of this addresses you exact need, though.


    All I can suggest is to file a wish list item through all conceivable channels,
    such as Autodesk product support, ADN, AUGI, direct contact to product managers
    etc.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    I wasn''t passing phase info [Phase Dependent Room Properties <a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2011/02/phase-dependent-room-properties.html]">http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2011/02/phase-dependent-room-properties.html]</a>


    It shows room no now.

  body: "Hi Jeremy,\n\nYour fantastic blog is still useful for me, thanks a lot for\
    \ sharing your work.\n\n\"A surprisingly simple method to access the set of all\
    \ elements listed in a schedule is to instantiate a filtered element collector\
    \ providing the schedule view as an initial input argument. That returns exactly\
    \ the desired elements. This works for key schedules as well.\"\n\nThis is what\
    \ I successfully did. However I still have some trouble attempting to populate\
    \ a Windows forms combobox datasource with the possible values for my key parameter\
    \ : how can I get/add the \"none\" value, which is represented in the French Revit\
    \ version by the string \"(aucun)\", to the combobox datasource ?\n\n\n public\
    \ static List<Element> GetPossibleKeyParamValues(Document document)\n        {\n\
    \            // Get key schedule from param name\n            ViewSchedule key_schedule\
    \ = Utils.GetKeyScheduleFromParameterName(document, \"MyKeyParamName\");\n   \
    \            \n            // Return elements of that key schedule\n         \
    \   if (null == key_schedule)\n                return null;\n            \n  \
    \          List<Element> res = new List<Element>(new FilteredElementCollector(document,\
    \ key_schedule.Id));\n\n      // How to add the \"none\" value to this Element\
    \ list? \n      // because what I get is Val1, Val2, ..., Valn\n           \n\
    \ return res;\n        }\n\n\nThen in the form init method :\n\n\n comboBox.DataSource\
    \ = GetPossibleKeyParamValues(document);\n comboBox.DisplayMember = \"Name\";\n\
    \           \nThanks in advance for your ideas :)\n\nM.VALLEE\n           \n-----"
