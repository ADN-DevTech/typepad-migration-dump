  body: 'Consider insetead of creating a type called "Type 1" you instead create a
    type with the same name as the short family file name, which can be retrieved
    using the API from the current document.


    A family loaded into a project that has no types in it will get a default type
    assigned to it in the project editor that''s the same as the short family file
    name.


    By naming your type that way, it will behave the same way in the project editor
    as if no types were defined.


    The only way it would behave differently is if the family file name itself changes
    in the future.  Then the old family file name will show up as the only type available
    in the project browser.'

    which is natural and untouched.

    Should be documented, or Revit should be changed to produce this type automatically.  It''s
    a detail I should not need to concern myself with as a plug-in developer.'

    You must have at least one type defined to add parameters, and that''s it.


    There is no reason why the number should grow beyond that.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: 'Hi Jeremy,


    Its kind a late for asking but let me ask you...


    I have only one Type in my family say "RoundPipe" and when I place my instance
    of this RoundPipe type I must change its value before sending it to "PromptForFamilyInstancePlacement"


    What I want to say is that my instances will have different parameter value but
    all will be derived from same family type (FamilySymbol) without creating a new
    type or new symbol


    Thanks


    Shourov'

  body: 'Dear Shourov,


    I assume that you mean ''change a parameter value'' when you say ''change its
    value''.


    Unfortunately, you cannot do this before placing it, so the call to PromptForFamilyInstancePlacement
    must come first, and the initial value will be whatever default is defined for
    your family symbol.


    You can change the value immediately after placement, however, e.g. using the
    dynamic model updater framework DMU.


    Cheers, Jeremy.
