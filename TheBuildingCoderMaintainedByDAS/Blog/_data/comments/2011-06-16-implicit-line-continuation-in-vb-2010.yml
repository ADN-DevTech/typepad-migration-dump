    I mentioned one possibility in

    Here is the direct link I mentioned there, to "7 Freely available E-Books/Guides
    I found essential for .NET Programmers and Architects":

    They are maybe a bit advanced. Here is one recommendation for beginners:

    I would also assume that Kean Walmsley has some good advice for you:

    Look at his topics DevTV and AutoCAD.NET, for example, they point to lots of beginner''s
    tutorials.


    The DevTV series helps you get started with .NET in both AutoCAD and Revit:

    I think there was an introductory class on generic C# and .NET programming at
    Autodesk University 2010, but I can''t find it right now, I''m afraid.


    Cheers, Jeremy.
