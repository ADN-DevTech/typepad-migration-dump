    Thank you for the interesting observation and good advice.


    If you ever run into such a situation again, please submit a DevHelp Online case
    with the sample code and model immediately, so that we can explore and fix the
    problem.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    I''ll do so.

    If there is some time for it...

    It may be that this behaviour occurred in a beta version, so it may already be
    fixed.



    Bye,

    Rudolf'

    Is there any way to constrain a floor edge to a particular wall or reference similar
    to an align/lock in the main interface?  Even better, can you associate a floor
    sketch line with a wall somehow?  I''ve looked but can''t find anything...'

    The ItemFactoryBase.NewAlignment method might work in a project context as well
    as in a family one.


    I have only tested it in the family API myself.

  body: 'Hi Jeremy,


    I know this is an old post so you may not see this but worth a try...  I have
    a quandry regarding the CurveArray passed to the NewFloor method that I''m having
    trouble with.  Basically it seems that when I pass the CurveArray, some lines
    ''jump'' to different locations about 25% of the time and I can''t figure out
    why.  I have created model lines from the CurveArray which come out correctly,
    then passed the CurveArray in the next line of code to the NewFloor method and
    experienced the jump.


    I posted a more thorough description on AUGI at <a href="http://forums.augi.com/showthread.php?p=1166825#post1166825">http://forums.augi.com/showthread.php?p=1166825#post1166825</a>
    and it seems that someone else is having that issue with joining walls.  Anyway,
    I was wondering if you knew of any ''magic'' in the API that I may be missing
    that would cause this?


    Thanks for any help you can give,

    Steve Faust'

    This modification has been documented about a million times, so you probably found
    a solution for it yourself by now.


    Still, for the sake of completeness, I''ll repeat once more that the geometry
    object itself was made iterable, so you can simply replace the ''geo.Objects''
    property by ''geo'' itself.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'
