  body: 'Hi Jeremy,

    it would be interesting to know how to change the text of *any* UI element (e.g.
    RibbonItems, title of a dialog, category names in the Project Browser tree or
    property names in the property sheet).


    If it would be possible to change the UI texts at runtime, Autodesk could simplify
    the delivering process.


    Okay, I know that there is special content for different countries (RTEs, RFTs),
    but the main program stays the same, as far as I can see.

    What about delivering a language-independent Revit with the localized content
    being just a plug-in ?

    Since it is not possible to run both English and German Revit on the same machine,
    one could develop (and test) localized plug-ins without the need of installing
    other Revits in VMs.'

  body: 'Dear Rudolf,


    That really would be very interesting indeed!


    If you would like to pursue the topic further, I would suggest talking with Kean
    about it, since he initiated the idea.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: "Hi Jeremy,\n\nI forwarded it to Kean.\n\nBy the way, thinking about AutoCAD:\n\
    Architectural (Desktop) seems to be just a naked AutoCAD with additional ARX/DBX\
    \ modules, plus some CUIXs etc. \nThus, Autodesk products already *have* a modular\
    \ concept. \nWhy not expand this concept to the *language* aspect ?\n\nOkay, I\
    \ know that this blog might be the false addressee, but I think that you have\
    \ a direct connection to the Autodesk developers, so they read it, anyway. \n\n\
    Bye,\nRudolf"
