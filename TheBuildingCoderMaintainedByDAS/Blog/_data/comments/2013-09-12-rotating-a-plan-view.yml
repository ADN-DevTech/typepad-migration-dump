  body: 'Jeremy,

    I tried out this macro, thank you.  The view gets duplicated and rotates, but
    the actual crop box does not "rotate".  For example if the view crop is rectangular
    in a landscape position, the macro should rotate this to be in a portrait position.  Is
    there a way to accomplish this?  I''ve tried looking into the Transform utilities
    to get the new coordinates of a rotated rectangle but I''m not quite understanding
    it.  Thanks.'

  body: 'Jeremy, thank you for this interesting discussion.

    as comming from the dynamo side of life things are not very easy, especially limited
    coding skills and worst of all having to translate to python!

    but after little thinking most of your examples are running inside dynamo.

    as right now i am haunted by rotated room plans i tried to transpose your example.

    actually i am failing to get a cropBoxElement.Id

    what am i missing?

    - in python shells at the moment transactiongroups are not supported (obviously)
    as the internal TransactionManager keeps control.

    Thank you for your appreciation. Glad you like it!


    Have you had a look at the possibilities to generate IronPython code from Reflector
    or JustDecompile?
