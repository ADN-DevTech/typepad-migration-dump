  body: I have found your posts to be very interesting although i do not understand
    them completely. Could you give me some advice for where to find information on
    building codes in revit? Many thanks.

  body: 'Dear T.,


    Thank you very much, I am glad you find it interesting. What building codes are
    you interested in? Switzerland? France? Sweden? Sorry, just a joke. Actually I
    have no idea whatsoever. As far as I know, most countries have their own building
    codes. The name of the blog is indeed a pun on buiding codes and coding as in
    programming, but I am only involved in the programming side, and am sorry to say
    I have no advice at all to give relating to building codes.


    Good luck and best regards, Jeremy.'

    Thank you for the wonderful question. The answer is not simple. I will reply to
    it in a separate blog post very soon. Keep your eyes peeled.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: "Hi Jeremy,\n\nThanks for very useful posts about slab geometry. This one\
    \ is probably the most advanced piece of Revit slab geometry analysis out on the\
    \ internet at the moment, however I am facing a more complicated problem that\
    \ seems to have never been discussed: I need to create a slab that apart from\
    \ holes might have areas of different thickness (depressions, extrusions, etc.).\
    \ Is there a way to do this programmatically? The only partial solution that I\
    \ have come up is splitting a slab to a number of subareas of constant width and\
    \ creating a separate slab for each subarea. This is involves some serious geometrical\
    \ calculations and seems to be very awkward, knowing that such cases can be relatively\
    \ easily be handled in Revit UI. E.g. one possible way to create a depression,\
    \ described in the ‘Mastering Revit Structure 2009’ is as follows:\n\nTo create\
    \ a depression in a slab: \n1. Go to a plan view of the slab;\n2. On the Modeling\
    \ menu, click Create..;\n3. Select Floors for the category and name the new family\
    \ something descriptive like Depression First Floor. That puts you into Sketch\
    \ mode;\n4. On the Modeling menu, click Void Form -> Void Extrusion;\n5. Click\
    \ Lines and use the drawing tools to make the boundary of the depression;\n6.\
    \ Click Extrusion Properties on the Sketch menu;\n7. Set the extrusion end value\
    \ equal to the depth of the depression;\n8, Click Finish Sketch;\n10. On the toolbar\
    \ click the Cut Geometry button;\n11. Select the slab or deck and then select\
    \ the void;\n12. Click Finish Sketch, and Revit Structure creates the depression.\n\
    \n\nAny ideas would be greatly appreciated. \nKind regards,\n\nJustas"

  body: 'Dear Justas,


    You did not reveal to us what you did in step 9. Is that a private secret of yours?  :-)


    Have you tried the SlabShapeEditor class using a floor with a variable thickness
    layer?


    Its use is demonstrated by the Revit SDK SlabShapeEditing sample.


    Cheers, Jeremy.
