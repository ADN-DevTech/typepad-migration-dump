  body: 'hi jeremy,I have a small question: i want to get the geometry of the slabs
    with the geometry of the holes hosted in them. I can get the geometry of the slab
    and the geometry of the hole, but i have problems getting the goemetry when i
    have an unhosted hole that go through a slab, because i have to make some hard
    work to get the hole that the unhosted hole makes in the slab. I think must be
    a more direct way to get all the curves in the slab maked by hosted and unhosted
    holes. I mean when you pass the cursor over the slab all the curves in the slab
    made by the slab geometry and by the holes get highlighted, i want those curves.
    I have seen boundarysegment class but im not sure this can help me. I hope you
    can undestand me. Regards!'

  body: 'Dear Andres,


    I would have expected that when you ask the slab for its geometry using Element.get_Geometry,
    the geometry returned includes all the holes in it regardless of whether they
    were generated by hosted openings or other objects.


    Is that not the case? Exactly how are you querying the slab geometry? Exactly
    how are the unhosted holes defined?


    Cheers, Jeremy.'
