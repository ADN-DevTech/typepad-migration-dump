    \ locate or identify ReferencePlane in familyinstance. and what is array reference\

  body: 'Dear Dharanidharan,


    To create a dimensioning element, you need to determine some references to the
    geometry being dimensioned.


    The Building Coder sample command CmdNewDimensionLabel provides an example.


    There are a number of ways to identify a reference plane. Two of them are demonstrated
    by the findElement method in the Revit Family API labs, using the element name
    and the plane normal vector:

    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: "Hi Jeremy Tammik,\n\n Thanks for your replay. i can create Dimension. But\
    \ how to assign the Dimension lable.  Ill create the rectangle family and paste\
    \ family instance in Document (South Elevation). Now select the object and get\
    \ the information through GeometryObject. its return the four line (two vertical,\
    \ two horizontal), then i can easily get line refrence and create the Dimension\
    \ it dont make errors. \n  \n  Now, Dimension object accept only FamilyParameter.\
    \ if i create the FamilyParameter using Familymanager it makes error (Family manager\
    \ only used for Family Editor). then how can i assign the value in label with\
    \ the familyparameter of familyinstance. \n\nThanks in advance\nDharanidharan\

  body: 'Dear Dharanidharan,


    Congratulations on the great progress you have made.


    Yes, the family manager only works in the family context, so if you absolutely
    need to create a family parameter you will have to do so there.


    I cannot tell you off-hand whether that is the way you have to go.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: 'Dear Jeremy,


    I want to programatically create a legend view for doors and windows. Just learned
    from your blog, there are no functions exposed to create legend components. We
    have to create one, copy it and then change Component Type property.


    It is easy to get all windows instances. But how could I get the legend components
    used in a project? I mean those just listed in the family tree and not manually
    created in a legend view.


    Regards,

    Eric'

  body: 'Dear Eric,


    You can filter for the BuiltInCategory.OST_LegendComponents.


    Beyond that, there is not much to identify them with, I believe, except their
    name, if you think you can rely on that.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'
