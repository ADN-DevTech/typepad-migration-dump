    Is it possible to get length of GenericModels?

    I''ve got an extraction of model which follow a Line way...

    Is it possible?


    Thx and Cheers!'

  body: 'Dear Pierre-Nelson,


    You definitely get the prize for the most cryptic comment of the week. Congratulations!


    I would say yes, because that is my favourite answer.


    I hardly know what you mean, though.


    To determine the "length" of a totally arbitrary generic model, I would traverse
    its geometry, grab all vertices, and calculate the maximum distance, i.e. the
    maximal diameter of the resulting point cloud.


    If you are talking about an extrusion, then you can easily get at its extrusion
    length using the Extrusion.EndOffset property.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: 'Hi Jeremy,


    Thx for your answer. I''m gonna see if it is possible to traverse the geometry
    of my Generic Model....

    But, is it possible with the API 2010?

    Anyway, I will try.

    Do you have an example of this?


    Thx and sorry if my english is sooooo bad....


    Cheers.'

  body: 'Hi Jeremy,


    Regarding Railings, we found limited API support in Revit 2014 to get the railing
    components and their data (geometry, materials).

    What we need is to obtain all the railing components, their materials with area
    and volume.

    Do you know of a way to achieve this?


    Thank you!'

  body: 'Dear Marius,


    All I know is documented above. Sorry the coverage is not complete. Still, it
    includes the geometry, doesn''t it? And that includes materials, doesn''t it?
    If that is not enough, you could try grabbing some more information on faces and
    materials from a custom exporter:
