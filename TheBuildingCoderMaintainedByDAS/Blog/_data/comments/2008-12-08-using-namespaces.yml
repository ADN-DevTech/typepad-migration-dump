    Sorry to post off topic, but I''m coming up empty on internet searches. I''m trying
    to find an example of consuming an asp.net web service in the revit api. Do you
    know of any?'

    Yes, that would be great. I don''t want you to send me all your code, but just
    the basic hook ups on the server and client side would be perfect.

    I would also like to thank you for helping out! I will be posting a short little
    note on web services in a day or two ... basically, it will just say that you
    can add your own Revit.exe.config file in the folder where Revit.exe is located
    to define some additional settings ...


    Best regards, Jeremy.'

    So I can use a Revit.exe.config to get the parameters for the client and bindings?
    That was specifically the problem I was having, because the dll wasn''t picking
    up the config for the app. I''ve already programmed around it, but I''ll probably
    switch back now. Is that file used for anything else by Revit itself?'

    No, by default that file is not used by Revit at all, as far as I know. Assuming
    it is not present  :-)  If you create it, I guess it will be read in and evaluated
    automatically by the .NET framework, so you should probably try to minimise the
    amount of stuff you put in. I just posted a new little item on this topic and
    look forward to further comments on that.


    Best regards, Jeremy.'

    For information on your first steps into Revit programming, I suggest you have
    a look at the DevTV recording:


    <a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2009/12/updated-devtv-introduction-to-revit-programming.html">http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2009/12/updated-devtv-introduction-to-revit-programming.html</a>


    This is not targeted at helping you learn VB or C# and .NET programming. For that,
    you would have to look for other resources, e.g.


    <a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2009/07/a-net-language-learning-resource.html">http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2009/07/a-net-language-learning-resource.html</a>


    Rod Howarth also covers getting started resources for both Revit API and generic
    .NET in his AU class:

    I found the reason for the problem. I used VB.NET code for VSTA. And they should
    be arranged to application in different ways.

    So thank you for opportunity to ask a question and excuse me for that stupid question.

    Nope, you do not need any other than those two references to obtain access to
    the full Revit API.


    The namespace Autodesk.Revit.Geometry was provided in the Revit 2010 API, though.


    In Revit 2011 and 2012 the geometry elements were moved into the namespace Autodesk.Revit.DB.

    To create a folder within a Visual Studio project, right click on the project
    in the solution view and select Add > New Folder.


    If you open the RevitLookup solution RevitLookup.sln provided in C:\a\lib\revit\2012\SDK\RevitLookup\CS
    or wherever you installed the Revit 2012 SDK, it already contains a subfolder
    Utils.
