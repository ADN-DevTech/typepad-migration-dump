    Are you going to update them to language independent ?


    Thank you.'

  body: 'Dear Yuji-san,


    Thank you for this information. I am asking my colleagues what we should do about
    it. Meanwhile, if you would like to convert it to a language independent form
    yourself, please go ahead and do so. I will happily publish the result for you,
    if you like.


    I did a similar thing for the FrameBuilder sample when I ran into a language dependence
    there:

    Please note that the SDK samples are just samples, demonstrating the use of the
    Revit API. This does not mean that they need to be perfect or even fully functional.
    The main thing is that they demonstrate the usage of the API, get the message
    across, show how to proceed to develop your own application code.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'
