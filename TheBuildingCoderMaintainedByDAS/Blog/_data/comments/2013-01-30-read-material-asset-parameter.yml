    \nIt's probably a matter of taste - I just don't like parameters."

  body: 'Dear Alexander,


    Wow, thank you very much for that improvement!


    That really clears things up a lot.


    It is not only a matter of taste, actually. I think everybody would agree that
    parameters are harder to use, and unfortunately still undocumented. I also always
    prefer using direct property access such as the steps you describe, since it is
    properly documented and easier to read.


    I''ll promote your comment to a main blog post sometime soon to ensure nobody
    misses it.


    Cheers, Jeremy.
