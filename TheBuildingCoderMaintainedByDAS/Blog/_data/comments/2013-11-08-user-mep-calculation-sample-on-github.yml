  body: 'Hi Jeremy,


    Thanks for a great blog, it''s been a big help for me learning to use the Revit
    API. I have a question that I have not been able to find the answer to in previous
    posts. I have a number of forms (created with the NewFormByCap method) that I
    want to color in different colors. How would I go about doing that? I have only
    managed to change the color of all of them using Category.Color, but this is not
    really what I want to do.


    Best Regards,

    Johanna'

    Thank you for your appreciation. I am glad you like it and you find it useful.


    As usual, you should set up the required situation manually through the user interface
    first and then explore it using RevitLookup, the BipChecker, the interactive Python
    or Ruby shell, and any other tools that you find useful to detect the differences.


    That will tell you how to achieve your manual adjustment programmatically as well,
    if you are lucky and it is possible at all.


    I the case of colours, you have a rather overwhelming number of possible options:
