    Thank you very much for useful post.

    Are you planning to add API methods to synchronize file with central programmatically
    in future version? I think it would be very useful.

    Thanks, Victor.'

    God knows whether we will see the sun tomorrow.


    All I can say is that we have an open wish list item for this functionality.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    At this moment I don''t need this functionality. But if you open wish list case
    for it - it is good news already. May be when I need sync files via API you will
    already add it.:)


    Best Regards, Victor.'

    Sorry, I don''t really know. Good luck with your experiments and let us now what
    you find out.


    Cheers, Jeremy.
