  body: 'Dear Ahmed,


    I would suggest working through the getting started material and then getting
    it running yourself:


    <a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2011/10/getting-started-with-the-revit-2012-api.html">http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2011/10/getting-started-with-the-revit-2012-api.html</a>


    It is easy!


    It will probably require some slight tweaking to migrate from Revit 2010 to 2012,
    though.


    By the way, this add-in rather outdated now, and the Revit MEP 2011 API added
    a new panel schedule API which may make some of its functionality obsolete.

    Cheers, Jeremy.'
