    Hi Jeremy,


    Changing an icon at runtime, would allow you to simulate a checkbox.

    One could display some global variables this way.

    The user could set them by just one click.


    Just an idea.


    Cheers,

    Yes,  agree, that is nice and clean also.


    Some people prefer embedding the icons in the assembly to avoid having them in
    separate external files.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: 'Hi Jeremy,


    is there a way to animate the ToolTipImage of a RibbonItem ?

    It would be great if developers could show their own animated videos, as Revit
    itself does, e.g. if drawing a wall.


    Some sort of animated gif would do the job.


    Any idea ?


    Cheers,

  body: "Hello, Rudolf.\nI'll try to answer for Jeremy.\n\nYes, it is possible and\
    \ I've found the undocumented way to add your own video to the tool tip.\n\nThere\
    \ are many interesting classes in the AdWindows.dll assembly and in the UIFramework.dll\
    \ assemblies which you can find in the Revit program folder.\n\nThere is a RibbonToolTip\
    \ class in the AdWindows.dll assembly. The class has a property - ExpandedVideo.\
    \ The next step is to find a class which can contain ToolTip property. This class\
    \ is Autodesk.Windows.RibbonItem.\n\nSo, the idea is to find the correct RibbonItem\
    \ in the ribbon control and set RibbonToolTip to it.\n\nBut here there is the\
    \ trouble. We create a PushButton on a Panel (Application.CreatePanel().AddItem(RevitItem)\
    \ we get a Autodesk.Revit.UI.RibbonItem. But we need Autodesk.Windows.RibbonItem.\n\
    \nThere are several ways.\nThe first one - use RevitControl class and iterate\
    \ all tabs, panels and buttons and find button by name.\nWe can get RevitControl\
    \ instance using static property RibbonControl UIFramework.RevitRibbonControl\
    \ class.\nRibbonControl contains exactly Autodesk.Windows.RibbonItem items not\
    \ a Autodesk.Revit.UI.RibbonItem. It's look like we need.\nHere is the code: <a\
    \ href=\"http://pastebin.com/aXZ6u2nL\">http://pastebin.com/aXZ6u2nL</a>\n\nBut\
    \ there is a second way. The Autodesk.Revit.UI.RibbonItem class has an internal\
    \ method getRibbonItem() which returns Autodesk.Windows.RibbonItem. Interesting.\
    \ Try to use this method. The reflection helps us.\nHere is the code: <a href=\"\
    http://pastebin.com/52hVR61d\">http://pastebin.com/52hVR61d</a>\n\nSo, after we\
    \ get a Autodesk.Windows.RibbonItem we can set RibbonToolTip to it. \nFor example\
    \ like here: <a href=\"http://pastebin.com/XtpKjLYq\">http://pastebin.com/XtpKjLYq</a>\n\
    \nPROFIT!!!\n\nAlso there is a third way to get a Autodesk.Windows.RibbonItem.\
    \ Create a tab, panel and button directly via RevitControl class. But I didn't\
    \ find how to set IExtenalCommand to a button. \n\nRevitToolTip.ExpandedVideo\
    \ support SWF video. Also I'tried a GIF image. The Gif was shown but didn't animate.\
    \ Also I tried to set Internet url. On my computer it doesn't work. May be it\
    \ doesn't work via proxy or may be access is denied on video in the internet.\
    \ Please try and tell me.\n\nAt the last, the full source code of my test project\
    \ with video tool tip buttons.\n<a href=\"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/62538318/Revit/VCButtonsWithVideoToolTip.zip\"\
    >http://dl.dropbox.com/u/62538318/Revit/VCButtonsWithVideoToolTip.zip</a>\n\n\
    Hope the information is useful for you.\n\nP.S. Jeremy, I believe it is also the\
    \ nice new topic for your blog.\n\nBest regards, Victor."

    thanks for answering my question.


    Some time ago, I played around with AdWindows.dll, too:

    ;-)


    I''m in holiday until next monday, so it will take some time to answer your big
    post.


    As far as I know, you can change the IExternalCommand that is assigned to a button
    *at runtime*.


    I really like it if the discussion in the comments section generates new blog
    postings.

    It shows that there is a growing community.



    See you, have a nice weekend,

    Rudolf'
