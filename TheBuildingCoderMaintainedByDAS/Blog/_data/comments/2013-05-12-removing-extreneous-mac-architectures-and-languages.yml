    Thanks for the heads up!  Are you dividing your SSD into an OSX and a Windows
    partition and putting Revit on the Windows partition?  If so could you in the
    future do a post detailing how it all works?  I have a 2011 iMac and at somepoint
    I would like to get a SSD especially if it will help me out with running Revit.


    Thanks,

    Travis'

    Thank you for the appreciation.


    No, not at all. I have one single Mac partition.


    If you look carefully at the screen snapshot at the bottom, you can see that a
    large chunk of it is occupied by Parallels.


    I am running Windows inside of a Parallels VM. Three Windows, in fact: my old
    XP machine that I migrated into here and have been using for a  number of years
    already, and Windows 7 and 8 for running Revit 14 in. It won''t run on XP :-)


    Cheers, Jeremy.'
