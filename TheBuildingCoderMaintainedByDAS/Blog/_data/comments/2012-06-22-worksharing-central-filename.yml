  body: Really?  ModelPathUtils.ConvertModelPathToUserVisiblePath instead of ModelPath.ToString?  Who
    thinks up this stuff?  ;-)

    \ You might want to try some yourself. Who knows what you might come up with?\n\
    \nThe best thing about standards is, there are so many of them to choose from.\n\
    \nOr as Groucho Marx put it: \n\nI have my principles! And if they don't suit\
    \ you, I have others as well!\n\nCheers, Jeremy."

  body: I'm struggling to find the IsServerPath and IsFilePath predicates, and these

    Sorry, that is actually referring to the Boolean ModelPath.ServerPath property,
    which returns ''whether this path is a server path or a file path''.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'
