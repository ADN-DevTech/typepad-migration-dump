  body: 'Hi Jeremy,


    How are you?

    I''ve got a question for you.

    I''ve searched but...no idea...


    I''d like to change de view with API. For exemple, passing floor plan level0 to
    the floor plan level1 with the API.

    I rode that it could be possible using ShowElement..but how??


    Cheers.'

  body: 'Dear Pierre,


    Thank you, I am fine, I hope you are as well. I am sorry to say that there is
    currently no possibility in the API to change a view. A wish list item for this
    functionality has been recorded. One developer found a really horrible workaround
    which does actually change the view, but it is only usable for internal debugging
    and development purposes: if you pass the view back to Revit in the set of elements
    to highlight in case of an error in an external command and then return ''Failed'',
    the view is displayed together with the error message. Obviously this is not usable
    for production purposes, but it does constitute a funny and surprising workaround.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    Thanks you answer my questions before.


    I get questions for you.


    The first one is an error called "Expected two different points.". I think this
    error comes from two model line on superposition. And how can I make two model
    line on superposiontion without error?


    The second one is how to change the color of model line.


    Thanks, have a good day.'

    Thank you, I am fine, I hope you are as well. Glad I could answer your questions.
    I don''t know either how to reproduce or how to avoid the error you mention. You
    might want to have a look at this post on the minimal length of model lines in
    Revit, though:


    <a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2009/07/think-big-in-revit.html">http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2009/07/think-big-in-revit.html</a>


    Regarding the colour settings, I do not know how to set line colour completely
    freely. In Revit, things are generally managed in a systematic and parametric
    manner, which ensures that the model remains well structured. In this case, you
    can modify model line colours by changing line style settings. I did the following
    to test this:


    - Create a couple of model lines


    - For each one of these, right click for the context menu and select Element Properties...
    > Line style and pick a different line style.


    - Right click somewhere in empty space in the current view to bring up the view
    context menu, and select View Properties... > Visibility/Graphics Overrides >
    Edit... > Model Categories > Visibility and search for the Lines entry. Click
    on the little plus sign to display the lines subcategories.


    - For each of the line styles you selected above, find the corresponding subcategory
    and change the colour displayed in its Projection/Surface Lines column.


    There are probably other methods as well.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    Thank you again for you response.


    I guess the NewProjectDocument() method only creates a document but it does not
    open it.

    So it works so far, I got the doucment saved.


    I tried to use the app.OpenDocumentFile(doc.PathName) to open it, it does not
    display the document.  Even though it shows it does.


    To verify, I subscribed a simple event handler to the app.OnDocumentOpen event
    (I am using Revit 2009), it did not execute.


    It sounds very simple to implement, but I just can’t find what I am missing.


    Regards,

    Nadim'

  body: 'Dear Nadim,


    Yes, correct, NewProjectDocument only creates a document and does not open it.


    There is currently no API method at all to make a document current in the Revit
    user interface. The only workaround I ever heard about is to use Process.Start
    as described in the comments

    Sorry for the bad news.

    It works.


    nothing is bad news as long as the RevitAPI developers are planning on fixing
    it


    So basically, the app.OpenDocumentFile() method will open the file but it would
    not display it :)

  body: 'I try to implement a macro in VSTA but cannot get this built. The compiler
    keeps complaining about an abstract class XYZ. ''Cannot create an instance of

    It seems like the XYZ class is defined as an abstract class in the VSTA environment
    and as a public class in the visual studio environment. One can check this by
    means of the object browser.

    What'' the reason for the difference? Can I port it somehow to VSTA?'

    One thing that you need to pay attention to in VSTA is that you cannot use the
    XYZ class default constructor. You have to use the creation application NewXYZ
    method instead to create new instances of XYZ objects.
