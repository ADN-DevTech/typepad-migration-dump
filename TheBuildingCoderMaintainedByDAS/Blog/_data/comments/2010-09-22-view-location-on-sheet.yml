  body: Is it possible to get the origin of the area of the viewport that is non-annotative?  In
    other words, each viewport has two boundaries.  The outer one is a little bigger
    for the sake of including annotation.  But the extent of the annotation boundary
    can vary from sheet to sheet.  Furthermore, the sheet dynamically changes the
    boundary according to whether it finds annotations in this outer boundary.  The
    result is that I cannot determine where the non-annotative crop region starts
    (on the sheet), as get_BoundingBox.Min gives the starting point of the outer crop
    box.

  body: "I'm working on an app to duplicate a sheet (ie duplicate all views on a sheet\
    \ and place them on a new sheet in the same place relative to the title block)\
    \ I've got this working apart from the location of the copied views on the new\
    \ sheet. They seem to have a mind of their own and end up all over the place.\
    \ \n\nThe only difference to the above code is that i'm using GetBoxOutline()\
    \ to get the outline cordinates for the View port and Viewport.Create() (both\
    \ 2013 addition I think). Even adding in the offset value doesn't work as in one\
    \ of my test sheets there are two viewports and one is moved up and one down in\
    \ the copied sheet. so the placement error isn't uniform or even in the same direction\
    \ for two view ports on the same sheet. I have no clue whats going on and any\
    \ help would be great."

    someone has further ideas the offsets appear to be different for each viewport.

    Have you taken a look at the Revit 2014 copy and paste API, and especially the
    new DuplicateViews SDK sample?

    That makes absolute sense, and sounds totally brilliant.


    Congratulations on solving that!


    Thank you very much for sharing and describing such an effective ''hicks-hack''  :-)


    Sorry, couldn''t resist, hope you don''t mind!

    My requirement is very similar to placing legends from one sheet to another.I
    have come across James Hicks reply but my apologies that I could not really understand
    it.Can you please help me give an idea how to implement it.BTW,I am new to Revit
    API.


    Thanks'

  body: 'Dear Madhuri,


    To begin with, if you are new to the Revit API, I can recommend two things:


    1. Take a look at the getting started material and all the tutorials to get a
    good hang of all aspects:


    <a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/about-the-author.html#2">http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/about-the-author.html#2</a>


    2. In general, if a feature is not available in the Revit product manually through
    the user interface, then the Revit API will not provide it either.


    Therefore, before thinking about possibly automating any task, it is important
    to explore the possibilities and develop an optimal solution through the user
    interface first. For that, I would suggest asking an application engineer, product
    usage expert, or product support for help on finding a suitable workflow and laying
    down best practices.


    To address your need, I would not recommend trying to reproduce James'' approach,
    if, as he says, it''s long and "hacky".


    A number of new view APIs have been added since that was written.


    To start with, look at Steve Mycynek''s and Scott Conover''s classes at Autodesk
    University 2012 and 2013, respectively:


    CP3133 - Using the Autodesk Revit Schedule and View APIs


    DV1823 - A 2014 Update to the Autodesk Revit Schedule and View APIs


    I hope this helps.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    Hope You are fine

    I''m trying to change the location of "Label Outline" in the viewport, In Visual
    studio I see Maximum point and Minimum point take the new values I set, But in
    Revit, no change!
