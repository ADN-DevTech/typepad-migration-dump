  body: 'Which vector corresponds to north? Is it (0, 1, 0)?


    According to a picture in the "Revit 2010 API Developer Guide", the y-Axis represents
    North/South and the x-Axis represents East/West - alas, it is not quite clear
    which way...'

    Yes, (0,1,0) is probably right. You can also use the XYZ.BasisY property instead
    of creating your own new XYZ instance for it.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: 'Hm... I found that the error appears when there is a reference to Revit.proxy.
    But when the RevitAPI is referenced the code is OK. But I can''t use the RevitAPI
    for VSTA, because errors occure in other places of code.


    Can you suggest something to get points subtraction?

    Thanks,

  body: 'Dear EK,


    I know nothing of VSTA, I just use the real API. I suspect that ''new XYZ()''
    does not work in VSTA; you have to use the Application.NewXYZ method instead of
    the default constructor.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    Congratulations on solving the issue and thank you for sharing the solution.


    So is the final result of your experience that you need to use explicit method
    calls in VSTA instead of built-in operators, e.g. Application.NewXYZ instead of
    ''new'' for creating and Subtract instead of ''-'' for subtracting?


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    One approach that you can use is to determine the intersections of the model line
    with building elements using the FindReferencesByDirection method, as discussed
    in a number of posts:

    Since I will be going on holiday now, I will not be able to answer any updates
    for while, so please be patient ... Thank you!
