    Is it possible to trigger the Property Dialog of a Family through API (to show
    it)? I''m afraid not but I ask ;-). Would be cool not have to program it again.

    Just as you suspect, the official API provides no such functionality. You might
    try various tricks using the Win32 API to simulate some user interaction:

    There are also tools available that make use of this kind of technique internally
    and shield you from some of the nitty gritty details, such as AutoHotKey:

    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: 'Hi Jeremy,

    thanks for the answer. I tested the example code, and changed it to get a Revit
    App through Windows Title Bar Text but it gets tricky to get the correct Revit
    instance if there are more than one Revit instances active. That''s why I think
    I would try to retrieve the parameters of my interest in a Dialog.


    Best Regards

  body: 'Hi Roozbeh,


    I am glad you were able to make some use of the code and modify it for your use.
    One possible way to avoid the issue of selecting the correct one out of multiple
    running Revit instances may be provided by making use of System.Diagnostics.Process.GetCurrentProcess.
    If you are inside a Revit command, that will ensure you get the instance of Revit
    that you are running in.


    You can definitely implement an application that sits and waits and watches for
    a certain dialogue to pop up, and then extracts data from it. This can be achieved
    using a windows hook based on the CBTProc function: The CBTProc hook procedure
    is an application-defined or library-defined call-back function used with the
    SetWindowsHookEx function. The system calls this function before activating, creating,
    destroying, minimizing, maximizing, moving, or sizing a window.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'
