    I have already look at the RevitSDK sample. I found this sample code called :

  body: 'Hi Jeremy, thank you for this insite, it makes me question why does it not
    use the enablers, when all the documentation on the adesk site suggests it does,
    or am I reading it wrong?.


    Also state

    "Revit does not register itself as a RealDWG application, and so the object enabler
    installers do not see it and do not set up any object enabler autoloading"


    If I look at my registery ater installing Revit 2010, under key 69AB5C28B75C0B24697E99A66AB34651
    which is the Host App Reg locations, Revit is listed.


    I guess I dont realy follow what you are suggesting, does Revit use Object Enablers
    to display custom entities or not? If not, are you suggesting it may be possible
    to load the enabler myself withon Revit, if so, how would you get the graphics
    to display in Revit?

    Regards

    Andy Robins'

  body: 'Hi, Jeremy.


    I am working with a custom RealDWG-registered app, and trying to pull the geometric
    data for custom entities into an AcGiWorldDraw-derived class.


    Within this app, I am able to load the enablers just fine.  Unfortunately, anytime
    I use a custom entity''s worldDraw() method, it returns ''false'', and nothing
    is added to my AcGiWorldDraw class.


    In some cases, I can get around this by using the entity''s explode() method,
    but this only works part of the time.


    Any suggestions?


    Thank you in advance for any ideas you may have!

  body: "Dear Dave,\n\nYour question has nothing to do with the Revit API, which is\
    \ what this blog focuses on, exclusively.\n\nStill, if memory serves right, he\
    \ fact that the worldDraw returns false means that the entity wants its viewportDraw\
    \ method called instead. To see the result of those calls, you have to implement\
    \ and handle the AcGiViewportDraw interface. \n\nThis kind of behaviour is shown\
    \ by AutoCAD Architecture custom entities, which display different graphics depending\
    \ on the viewport they are drawn in and many other factors.\n\nCheers, Jeremy."
