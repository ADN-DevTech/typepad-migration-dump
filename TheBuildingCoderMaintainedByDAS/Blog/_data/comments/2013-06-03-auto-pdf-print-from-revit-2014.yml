  body: 'Hi Jeremy,


    In conjunction with this article, I would like to present a very similar project
    implemented by me for my company. Actually, the utility works on Revit 2012 and
    2013, but I didn''t update the code for Revit 2014 yet (no project on Revit 2014
    so far :)


    Although I cannot disclose the code, I would like to present this thinking that
    it might suggest alternative approaches for those who would like to modify/adapt
    the code generously offered by Mr. Tartaglia.


    This is another Revit "AutoExport" utility (the supported formats are PDF, DWG,
    DXF, DWF and DGN), using almost the same approach (an overnight batch exporter
    based on the Windows task scheduler and the Revit idling event). It uses also
    a configuration file (XML), but it''s controlled through a few registry keys configured
    for the task by an (AutoIT) script.


    Of course, there are a lot of explanations in order to describe the whole process
    and I could also provide a few screen shots, but obviously, this is not the place
    to do this.


    If you think this would be interesting enough, just let me know, and I''ll send
    you the whole material.


    Regards,


    Constantin'

    Thank you for sharing this interesting information.


    I would be happy to publish your material if and only if it makes sense and is
    useful in some way for other developers to learn from or reuse.


    Otherwise, all I can suggest is that you provide a URL in a comment in response
    to this for people to go and look at your material themselves.


    Thank you!


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    I didn''t know about Rod''s AU presentation, I''m guessing a number of people
    are using the idling event in a similar fashion. My next steps are to get it working
    for DWG export and the creation of transmitted files. I''m using a simple text
    file to keep it ''simple'' for when I create an interface and so the values can
    be easily read by most of our users (we still have many users afraid/not used
    to XML and other formats).'

    I (naively and optimistically) think Rod''s implementation probably covers what
    you need pretty well.


    Furthermore, today''s post with the suggestions by Constantin should also prove
    quite useful in the endeavour.


    Also look at Daren''s very nice abstraction describing a pattern for semi-asynchronous
    Idling API access:

    Thank you for your appreciation and submitting your query here as a comment.


    You can do so forever, regardless of the age of the blog post.


    I am glad you find it useful.


    The installation is straightforward.


    As you see above, there are two components: a stand-alone executable run by the
    task scheduler, and a Revit add-in working with the Idling event.


    You can install the exe anywhere you like. It is up to you to see that the task
    scheduler finds and runs it.


    The Revit add-in is installed like any other.


    I hope this clarifies.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: 'Dear Frédéric,


    All Revit add-ins are installed in the same way.


    They consist of an add-in manifest with the filename extension *.addin.


    It is an XML file that you can edit and contains a tag pointing to the .NET add-in
    assembly DLL.


    The add-in manifest must be located in a folder that Revit searches, e.g. the
    one you mention.


    The add-in assembly can be placed anywhere you like.


    I place small simple add-ins in the same folder as the add-in manifest.


    Then there is no need to specify the full DLL pathname.


    All of this information is fully covered by the Revit API getting started material:

    There may well be some good and proper way to avoid this situation arising at
    all in the first place that I am not aware of.


    What I can say for sure is that you can automatically dismiss the dialogue if
    you so wish:

    Congratulations on getting it up and running.


    As always the functionality being used is built in to Revit itself.


    Does Revit provide such an option in the user interface?


    Alternatively, simply print sheet by sheet in separate steps.
