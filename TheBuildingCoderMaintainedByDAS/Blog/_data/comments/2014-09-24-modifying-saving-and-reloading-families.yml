  body: "Hi, nice routine, I want to try it out, and I am a bit too new to coding\
    \ to understand everything but the foolowing:\n\"You can use the GetParameters\

    \ get_Parameter method, if you can avoid it.\"\n\nwhen I get to build your solution\
    \ in VS, I get the error: \"Error\t1\t'Autodesk.Revit.DB.TextNoteType' does not\
    \ contain a definition for 'GetParameters' and no extension method 'GetParameters'\
    \ accepting a first argument of type 'Autodesk.Revit.DB.TextNoteType' could be\
    \ found (are you missing a using directive or an assembly reference?)\"\n\nif\
    \ I missed a reference, could you point me where I should look at, please.\n\n\
    I might try to use the routine to purge my families... I can't wait/\nthanks"

  body: 'Dear Jean-Marc,


    I have no idea how you managed to produce that error message.


    The GetParameters method was introduced in Revit 2015, so it does not exist in
    previous versions.


    It looks to me as if you are referencing an earlier version of the Revit API assembly,
    e.g. from Revit 2014.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    Sure.


    In Revit 2014, you can use get_Parameter.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: "Hi Jeremy, \n\nI got it to work in 2015. \nit takes a while to process, even\
    \ on a OutOfTheBox template. but it works.\n\nthat is a big headstart for what\
    \ I would like to achieve: open families of a project and purge them and then\
    \ reload them... \n\nI have seen ways to 'purge'/delete items in the families\
    \ doing some filtering per category getting reverse Ids list of families with\
    \ instances in the family/or model through Harry Mattison. \nbut is there a way,\
    \ or a better workaround? because filtering each category one by on seems a big\
    \ task to ask for each family. \n\nthe process of purging these family would take\
    \ forever (but that is just a guess)\n\nis there a way to access the built in\
    \ purge command in revit though the API. I have looked through the API doc of\
    \ 2015, and I could not find anything relevant besides an IsPurgeable member i\
    \ think"

    Congratulations on getting it to work!


    Yes, that would be cool. Unfortunately, this functionality is currently not accessible.
    We have an open wish list item for this access...


    Cheers, Jeremy.'
