  body: "I'm pretty sure this is unsupported, but it should work:\n - create one single\
    \ ExternalCommand\nIn the Execute-Method:\n - find the newest journal file (for\
    \ me, journal files are located in %localappdata%\\Autodesk\\Revit\\Autodesk Revit\
    \ 2015\\Journals)\n - read the last few lines of the journal file and search for:\n\
    \nJrn.RibbonEvent \"Execute external command:CustomCtrl_%PANELNAME%BUTTONNAME:CLASSNAME\"\
    \n\n - check \"CLASSNAME\" - should be the name of the external command class,\
    \ if not, it is not the right line in the journal file\n - use \"BUTTONNAME\"\
    \ to identify which button the user clicked on\n - execute something based on\
    \ BUTTONNAME\n\nIt might be prudent to open the journal file in shared mode, and/or\
    \ close it again as fast as possible so Revit can continue to write to the file.\
    \ \n\nThe journal files are very powerful, I really like them."

  body: 'Dear Alexander,


    Sounds like a good and efficient approach to me.


    Thank you very much for sharing this very cool idea.


    Yes, journal files can help create some very powerful tools.


    And, yes, it certainly is unsupported, cf. The Building Coder disclaimer:
