  body: 'Hi jeremy:


    I''m from Spain and my English is very bad, excuse me, but.

    Why when I select elements, no change the color (to color selection-red) in the
    window.


    I''m doing a macro for save selection in a file, I select any elements and save,
    after I select other elements and

    save with previous. At end I recovery all elements and they are selected but their
    color is not red.


    I''m very grateful for your job in API REVIT.


    Thenk you'

    \ method?\n\nThat performs repeated interactive insertion. \n\nThere are also\
    \ batch insertion methods, cf. the SDK sample ElementsBatchCreation.\n\nCheers,\

  body: "Dear Chan Long,\n\nYou can change each individual family instance type by\
    \ using its Symbol property, which returns or changes the FamilySymbol object\
    \ that represents the type of the instance. \n\nTo process many family instances,\
    \ treat them one by one in a loop or use the Element.ChangeTypeId method taking\
    \ an ElementId collection argument to change a whole batch in one call.\n\nCheers,\
    \ Jeremy."
