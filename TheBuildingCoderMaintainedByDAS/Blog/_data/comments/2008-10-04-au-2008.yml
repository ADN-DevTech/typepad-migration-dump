    Will there be any recordings made of presentations?'

  body: Nice.  The AEC API talk is scheduled for the same time as the ONE class I'm
    teaching.  Maybe I'll cancel, and send everyone over to yours.  ;-)

  body: 'Dear Danny,


    Oh dear, I am sorry to hear that. It will be a great chance to meet a few of the
    internal developers and discuss complex issues in-depth. It is important for them
    to meet real live external developers occasionally, and hear about their needs
    face to face. Maybe you can get in touch with some of them before or afterwards
    ... us ADN developer support people will definitely be around and accessible all
    the time!


    Best regards,


    Jeremy'

  body: 'Hi Jeremy, I wonder if you can help me.

    I am just about to start a PhD and a large part of it will relate to BIM. One
    of the things that I would like to do is to create an oledb driver which will
    allow the BIM within revit to be interrogated (and updated) using SQL.

    From conversations with colleagues I know that I can use the API to implement
    this, but I was wondering whether or not something along these lines already existed
    - I don''t want to reinvent any more wheels than necessary!

    I envisage writing a server application, so Revit will not actually be running
    against which clients may issue SQL commands, like "select equipment from rooms
    where roomid = ''abc''", or "update equipment set voltage = 240 where equipmentid
    = ''abc''"

    Does such a thing, or anything like it, exist already, either within AutoDesk
    or elsewhere?

    Thanks very much'

  body: 'Dear Graham,


    For one thing, you cannot easily create an application that drives Revit from
    outside, so you will need to either run your SQL commands within a Revit external
    command or other valid Revit API call-back context, cf.

    You can also make use of the Idling command to circumvent this restriction.


    There is a neat command line interface that might be exactly what you are searching
    for, but I have not made use of it myself yet, the RevitPythonShell:

    Please let us know how you get on.


    Cheers, Jeremy.
