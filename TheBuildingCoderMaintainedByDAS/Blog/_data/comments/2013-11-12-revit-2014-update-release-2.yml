  body: It also seems to fix the problem if an addin was registered using the Dockable
    framework, when closing the last view of the document, the document actually now
    closes.  Previously it didn't.  You had to close it through the close button accessed
    from the Big "R" in the top left corner.

  body: 'Dear Phillip,


    Oh, brilliant, thank you very much indeed for picking that up.


    It completely slipped my mind.


    Certainly the most important enhancement that I am aware of for add-in developers.


    I''ll add this above in the main text as well.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: 'Hi Jeremy,


    since UR2 the doc.Create.NewFloor method returns an error about unsatisfying geometry
    in the CurveArray i am using. But in UR1 the same method worked fine for the exact
    same geometry. So i was wondering about the curve order and used your SortCurvesContiguous()
    without success. still unsatisfying geometry. writing the curvearray directly
    as modellines works and looks correct. any idea on this?


    regards
