  body: "Hi, I am trying to write a little macro to open a file and set up sheet parameters\
    \ according to file contents (each line is a sheet number along with 2 other parameters\
    \ to be set: name and a drawing number).  I have several standalone projects (nothing\
    \ to do with Revit) that do similar things, but getting Revit macros to do this\
    \ is proving difficult.\n\nI get an error that \"The type or namespace name 'OpenFileDialog'\
    \ could not be found\" . . . I have a using System.IO entry, but it seems that\
    \ the macro works differently than the dll route.  Any insight into how to get\
    \ this to work as a macro?\n\nHere is my code:\n\t\tpublic void LoadDrawingNumbers()\n\
    \t\t{\n\t\t\t//Get document object\n            Document doc = this.ActiveUIDocument.Document;\n\
    \            FilteredElementCollector Sheets = new FilteredElementCollector(doc);\n\
    \            OpenFileDialog openFile = new OpenFileDialog();\n            openFile.InitialDirectory\
    \ = \"c:\\\\\";\n            openFile.Filter = \"txt files (*.txt)|*.txt|All Files\
    \ (*.*)|*.*\";\n            openFile.FilterIndex = 2;\n            openFile.RestoreDirectory\
    \ = true;\n            \n            if(openFile.ShowDialog() == TaskDialogResult.OK)\
    \ {\n            \ttry\n            \t{\n            \t\t// line by line\n   \
    \         \t}\n            \tcatch (Exception ex) {\n            \t\tMessageBox.Show(\"\
    Error: \" + ex.Message);\n            \t}\n            }\n }"

  body: 'Dear Paul,


    No, I am not very familiar with the macro environment, so I don''t know offhand.
    Did you solve this? How, please? Thank you!


    Cheers, Jeremy.
