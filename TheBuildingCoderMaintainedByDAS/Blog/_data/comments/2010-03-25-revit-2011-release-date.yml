  body: 'Ooooh, its so annoying being on the other side of the date line. It is 8am
    Thursday the 8th April here and only 5pm Wednesday the 7th in the US so I have
    to wait another 7 hours until the release goes on line. It''s like christmas morning
    as a kid waiting for your parents to get up so you could open presents.
