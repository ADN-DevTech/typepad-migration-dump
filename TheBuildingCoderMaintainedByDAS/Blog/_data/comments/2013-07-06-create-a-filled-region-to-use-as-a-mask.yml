    Not really. My only suggestion to start off with would be to specify what line
    you mean, and the exact behaviour that you observe.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    You seem to be lacking the Linq namespace.


    Add the following line at the top of the module:


    using System.Linq;

  body: Could you use this technique to change a filled region  to an area boundary?
    Using revit conventionally (copy and paste) it seems you can't make the transition
    between the 2, revit takes your boundary from your filled region and converts
    it to lines in the area plan.

  body: 'Jeremy,


    Is there any way to determine the line styles used for the boundary lines in a
    filled region?  Or better yet, is there an easier way to manipulate these line
    styles within a filled region (other than deleting and recreating the filled region)?
