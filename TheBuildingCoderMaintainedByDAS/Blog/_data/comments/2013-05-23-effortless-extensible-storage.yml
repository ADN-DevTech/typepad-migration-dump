  body: 'Another way to avoid some of the pain of ExtensibleStorage or storing structured
    data in Project Parameters is to use JSON.


    Create a single parameter and then serialize your object as a string into that
    parameter.


    We''ve found that to be flexible enough for us to deserialise settings into POCO''s,
    but also evolve those settings objects over time.'

    \nDid you notice that the CouchDB implementation of a NoSQL database that I have\

  body: Hello,  I've been using Extensible Storage in Revit 2014 and has worked quite
    well except in one instance.  If user uses "Create Similar" tool on an element,
    the new created element will not have the data assigned from the previous element.  If
    user copies like normal, the new element has the data.  Is there anyway you can
    suggest that the new element created by "Create Similar" tool can have the same
    data?  Thanks.

  body: 'Dear RevitArkitek,


    I am glad to hear you have been using it successfully and it mostly does what
    you want.


    Yes, this is exactly how extensible storage is designed to work.


    It does indeed get copied, and that is desirable, since by definition the extensible
    storage data is part of the element, once added.


    However, ''create similar'' cannot create the storage, for Revit does not know
    what it is, and thus cannot create ''similar'' data.


    If you really need this functionality, you can implement it programmatically,
    e.g. by using a DMU dynamic model updater or by programmatically detecting the
    newly added elements after the ''create similar'' operation and adding your extensible
    storage data to them in the manner you see fit.


    I hope this helps.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: 'Dear RevitArkitek,


    By the way, it is important to note that if it is important for you that all elements
    of interest to you have some specific extensible storage data attached, you need
    an updater anyway, since these objects can also be created from scratch at any
    time.


    I hope this helps.


    Cheers, Jeremy.
