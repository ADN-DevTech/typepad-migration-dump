  body: "Hi Jeremy, I started with simple one: points defining planar profiles & loft...\
    \ WIP\n\n1- read the points, put them in a list; \n2- sorted list it by Z value\
    \ (loft direction is up),\n3- method to find polygon by nearest point -still working\
    \ on it to have accuracy-\n4- put 'em in CurveArrayArray and pass them to loft\
    \ command\n\nthe curveby points didn't work as it seems to create a random spline\n\
    \nanother Q: it seems that we've no access to create room separation line?\n\n\
    Thanks in Advance\nAmmar"

    Regarding the room separation lines, please check out the NewRoomBoundaryLines,
    NewSpaceBoundaryLines, NewSpaces and other related methods.
