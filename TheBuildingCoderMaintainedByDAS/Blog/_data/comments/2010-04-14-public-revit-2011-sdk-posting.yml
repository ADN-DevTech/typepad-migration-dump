  body: 'Dear Richard,


    It does not really make any difference. The SDK really just provides information
    and samples. The actual PI is completely defined by and contained in the Revit
    API assemblies which are provided with the Revit product, in the Program subdirectory
    of the main installation folder where Revit.exe also resides. On my system they
    are


    2010-03-26  20:27  15,494,656 RevitAPI.dll

    2010-03-26  20:28     711,168 RevitAPIUI.dll


    I have not compared the two versions that you mention. Have you? What dates do
    they have?


    On my system I installed the one coming with the product, which is the 110,416,595
    byte version, and I have not noticed any problems with that. I must admit that
    I was not aware that there was another different version out there.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: 'Dear Ramesh,


    The document is writeable within the context of an external command that either
    uses automatic transactions, or manual transactions and opens its own transaction.
    There are many other contexts as well, but that is the most common one. Look at
    the getting started material and any one of the hundreds of sample commands provided
    in the various sample on this site.


    Cheers, Jeremy.
