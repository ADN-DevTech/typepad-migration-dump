  body: "This is a great idea, I had been thinking of something similar to this for\
    \ a while now, was planning to suggest it to Autodesk at some point. Is this an\
    \ Autodesk official site? because it would be great if this kind of functionality\
    \ was baked into Revit. \n\nIf Revit 2012 came with an ADN App Store inbuilt,\
    \ it would make it much easier for users to find and install add-ins. Those 2\
    \ things are the biggest challenge, many people don't even know certain add-ins\
    \ exist, let alone how to install them! \n\nBy the looks of things it seems like\
    \ it is a 3rd party thing, which means it probably won't reach all the users who\
    \ don't actively seek add-ins. But we'll see if it takes off, I hope it does!"

  body: "Hi Steve and Rod,\n\nThank you for your support!\n\nThis website has no connection\
    \ to ADSK. I hope you like the solution anyway :) \n\nI have submitted this solution\
    \ to Autodesk in both ADN network and to certain important persons at Autodesk\
    \ but for now they have no interest in this particular solution.\n\nIt is still\
    \ in a developmental stage but as soon as developers start using it and will submit\
    \ comments the service will be significantly better. As Jeremy writes, I will\
    \ go public as soon as a sufficient number of extensions is available for download.\
    \ Hopefully in the next couple of days/weeks!\n-----"
