    Thank you for your interest and appreciation!


    The Revit API does not implement or use constructors for many classes.


    The old way to do this is via the creation application and document, e.g. Autodesk.Revit.Creation.Application
    NewLine, NewArc,  NewHermiteSpline etc. methods. These are now obsolete.


    The new approach is to use static creation methods on each class instead, e.g.
    Autodesk.Revit.DB.Line CreateBound and CreateUnbound  methods.


    This an answer you can easily find for yourself by looking at the SDK samples
    or reading the blog, though.


    It is not much use reading it if you make no use of the information.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    One last question (I hope!) on this subject:


    - I am trying to GET the Hand Orientation XYZ values from Curtain Wall MULLIONS.
    Is that even possible? I see that those values can be seen within Revit Lookup.


    Regards,


    Eduardo'

  body: Already found the solution! I was getting the TYPE properties instead of the
    INSTANCE properties. Now I managed getting the HandOrientation values.
