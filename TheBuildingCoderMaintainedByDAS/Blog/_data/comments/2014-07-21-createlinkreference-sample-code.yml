  body: "Hi Jeremy,\n\nGreat application to Revit Links and families. \n\nI've got\
    \ a wall reference in terms of the Revit link (through a selection and filtering\
    \ linked elements), which I've converted to an Element ID in hopes that there\
    \ is an easy way to work backwards from the element to the link instance. Unfortunately\
    \ I haven't found a way to do it.\n\nIs there an easy way to pick up the Element\
    \ ID of the Link Instance from the wall reference? \n\nThanks!"

    Does this help?

    There may be something newer and better, however...


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: 'Hmm a bit! I was considering using this when we were on 2013, but we''re
    moving to 2015 so I was hoping there was another way. Quickly glancing at it I
    don''t know how I would take the link unique ID and convert it into something
    that I could use.


    My thought now is to just use an element collector and assume that there is only
    one link instance (which is usually the case). It''s kind of quick and dirty but
    it will get me what I need. I suppose if you have multiple links you can pick
    up all the links and test to see which one has the object (wall in this case)
    and use that checked link.


    Thanks for the insight'
