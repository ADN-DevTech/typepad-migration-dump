    UIDocument.PromptForFamilyInstancePlacement


    This was introduced in the 2011 API apparently. My question would be as to what
    are the limitations of it?'

  body: 'Dear Mr Smith,


    Yes, indeed, PromptForFamilyInstancePlacement always selects the correct overload
    of the NewFamilyInstance method.


    Or, actually, no, it does do anything of the kind.


    The NewFamilyInstance is the Revit API method, whereas the PromptForFamilyInstancePlacement
    does whatever it does inside of Revit without ''going out'' to the .NET environment
    and calling ''back in'' to Revit via the API.


    The only limitation I am aware of is that this method does whatever it does, and
    you have no access to modify that behaviour.

    Nice to hear that you are a regular, and were able to address all your needs so
    far.


    Whether or not you can or cannot drag and drop all instances at once ought to
    be irrelevant.


    Since the advent of the drag and drop API, you can drive that operation programmatically:

    You computer should not be too much bothered by such a repetitive task.


    Cheers, Jeremy.
