  body: Thanks again Jeremy. I was just about to launch into research as to what the
    "self-obvious" warning actually meant. Time saved.

  body: 'Hi Jeremy,


    One trick I found if you rightclick on a project in the solutionbrowser in VS
    you can unload it. Then you can edit the projectfile. After editing the projectfile
    you reload the project file and presto the warning is gone.

    Thank you for the hint.


    So far, I closed the project, edited, and reopened.


    You suggestion should save me a few milliseconds now and then.


    Every little helps  :-)


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: 'I recently ran into this.  It turns out there is a completely different approach
    to this problem that resolves the issue in a "correct" way.


    Whenever possible you try to build with AnyCPU, but you do eventually have to
    deal with platform _bitness_.


    The solution is to employ "AppDomain.CurrentDomain.AssemblyResolve" in a platform
    resolver/wrapper DLL that loads a platform specific version of a required component.  This
    approach is even more important in the case of plugins as it allows for an optimal
    solution for any given _bitness_.
