    Good luck with your trip.


    If the PushButton text is long, for example "My External Command" (hypothetical
    example), how can I place it on two lines just like it is shown in the "Structural
    Settings" Command in the "Manage" tab.

    There is no support for this in the Revit API. You may be able to somehow use
    some Revit independent API to access the ribbon buttons and modify their content.
    If you succeed with that, please let us know. Thank you!

    Is there any support for having a default button in the PullDownButton?

    I mean by that when hte pulldownbutton looks like two parts, the upper partclicks
    on of the pushbuttons in the list, and the bottom part gives the menu of pushbuttons
    added to this pulldownbutton.


    Example: Revit UI has alot of examples on this, like, Wall pulldownbutton (Home
    tab), ElementProperties pulldownbutton ( the default is the Instance Properties)

    As far as I know, the Revit API currently does not provide this possibility. As
    said before, the SDK Ribbon sample demonstrates everything that can be done with
    ribbons through the Revit API. I don''t know whether it might be possible to use
    some Revit independent API to access the ribbon buttons and modify their behaviour
    like you describe. If you succeed with that, please let us know. Thank you!

  body: 'Hi Jeremy,

    I have similar questions regarding the Ribbon Panel in Revit API, and will really
    appreciate if you could take a look at them:


    1) Is it possible to create a PullButton (B) inside another PullButton (A)and
    add couple of other PushButtons (a,b,c...)? (like A->B->(a,b,c...));


    2) I notice in your example, you have a "Press F1 for More Help" text line with
    a horizontal separator from the above button. So how to create a horizontal separator
    inside the PullButton? All I got from the API guide is the vertical separator
    for the Ribbon Panel(ribbonPanel.AddSeparator()).


    3) Currently Revit API only allows to stack 3 or less buttons, is there anyway
    to override that?


    Thank you!

    Happy New Year!


    Wei'

    1. Not as far as I know.


    2. The horizontal separator is in the tooltip that Revit has automatically created
    and displayed, not in the button.


    3. Not as far as I know.

  body: 'Hi Jeremy,

    Thanks for the reply. It seems that Revit wants to keep the panels simple and
    tidy:)


    Anyways, I found something funny! When I created some (3+) ribbon panels with
    1-tier pulldown buttons within the same C# project, and built them as add-in to
    the Revit program, it surprisingly became some 2-tier pulldown buttons because
    the panels took too much space and automatically contracted into pulldown button!
    Does Revit have some implicit rule on how big a panel should be? I know the panel
    images can''t exceed 32x32 pixels, but how could we actually configure these dimensions?


    Another question that has been bothering me is about the schedules/quantities.
    Shared parameters are very useful in the Revit program, and I tend to use them
    across different schedules/quantities or material takeoffs. However, is there
    any chance that we could link different schedules/quantities like we did in relational
    database (e.g. the Access or even the GIS program)based on specific shared parameter?
    Or could we make use of Revit API to manipulate those schedules/quantities tables
    as we did in Excel, say fill in a field in the table using functions?'

    Regarding the schedules, we do not have any access at all to those in the Revit

    Oh, now I understand. You are talking about your own custom panel that you added
    yourself.


    That is completely unsupported, so I would absolutely expect that to cause problems!


    Who knows what Revit does in the background. Maybe it regenerates all panels regularly
    as it sees fit. Not knowing about your custom panel, that would of course be obliterated
    by the Revit panel regeneration.


    I am not surprised, nor should you be.

  body: 'Dear Mohammad,


    Thank you for your query and your ADN case 1261390 [ExternalCommandData]. Please
    only use one of the channels in future, preferably the ADN DevHelp online one,
    since that will guarantee you an answer from anyone on the team and also ensure
    that the information is tracked in our internal knowledge base and can be easily
    hooked up with requests and wish list items.


    As stated in the blog post above, this method is not officially supported by the
    API and we cannot offer any help through ADN for these kind of workarounds.


    The Revit API only supports plug-ins adding entries to the existing Add-Ins and
    Analyse tabs in the Revit user interface.


    Still, the null value that I provide in the sample above can be improved upon,
    as demonstrated by Guy Robinson on his blog. I mentioned his posts on this topic
    in


    <a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2009/12/create-a-real-revit-ribbon-tab.html">http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2009/12/create-a-real-revit-ribbon-tab.html</a>

    I repeat that creating your own tab in the Revit ribbon is not officially supported,
    so you are making use of this functionality at your own risk and we cannot provide
    you with any support whatsoever in this area if you run into problems.

    So you are having problems trying compiling the room renumbering plugin of the

    As I said above, off-hand it looks to me as if you have some kind of version problem.


    Have you ever compiled any other Revit add-in of your own?


    If so, you should be able to solve this.


    If not, I suggest working through the ''My First Revit Plug-in'' tutorial:
