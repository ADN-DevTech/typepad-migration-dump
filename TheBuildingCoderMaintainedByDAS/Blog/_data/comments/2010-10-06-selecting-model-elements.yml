  body: 'Thanks for this great topic. After the implementation of the above code at
    least I get close to what I want.


    What I would like to know is during IFC export in Revit, how does the export routine
    tell which element required to export?


    Many Thanks'

  body: "Hi Jeremy,\nI am new to working with the revit API to create addins, so I\
    \ hope this is framed correctly. \nI have a filtered element collector and I use\
    \ this to create an array,\n  IList<Element> cols = ColumnCollector.WherePasses(filter).WhereElementIsNotElementType().ToElements();\n\
    \ni retrieve the built in category properties and within the same for each loop\
    \ I want to also retrieve the family symbol for each element. Is it possible to\
    \ cast or do something else to aquire both an elements built in  property and\
    \ its family symbol so that i can create a new family with this information?\n\
    cheers, \nfabs"

  body: 'Dear Fabs,


    You submit a rather mixed up question. Hmm. I would say yes. You are already retrieving
    the built-in category. Fine. Of course you can also retrieve the family symbol,
    but obviosuly only for family instances. So you would have to cast the element
    to a family instance. If that fails, it has no symbol, else you can query it using
    the FamilyInstance.Symbol property. Now it gets really hairy. I assume when you
    say "create a family" you mean something utterly different, e.g. "place a family
    instance". If so, then yes, possibly. But now my answer is too long and hypothetical
    anyway.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'
