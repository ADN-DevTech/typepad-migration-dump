  body: 'Hello Jeremy,


    The AdnSamples.txt file seems to be missing from the zip file, is there a simple
    way to load all these in to the RvtSamples input file?'

  body: 'Dear Zack,


    I am so happy you asked! This is the first time I have a hint that anybody except
    me is using it  :-)


    I added a download link to it in an addendum above.


    Thank you for asking.


    Cheers, Jeremy.
