    \ one, and then using the category of that in View.SetVisibility works wonders.\

  body: Is there any way in the Revit API to modify a view's annotation visibility
    wholesale?  I know that you can toggle the visibility of  individual categories
    for a view, but is there a way to duplicate the "Show annotated categories in
    this view" functionality outside of the UI?

  body: 'Dear Justin,


    There is currently no such API function to show or hide all annotated categories
    in a given view. You might collect all the categories that you consider to be
    annotative and toggle their visibility individually. Unfortunately, there is no
    API method to indicate whether a given category is of annotation or model type
    either.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: 'Dear Fm2,


    I don''t really know exactly what you mean by ''imported categories''.


    Do you mean categories that are generated by importing a DWG file, for example?


    Is this something you can do in the user interface?


    In any case, it sounds as if it should be pretty simple, since you have various
    methods on the View class to hide and isolate elements and categories. Therefore,
    if you can identify the categories you wish to hide, it should be possible to
    call the hide method on them as well.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: 'I''m having the same problem there is a read only Boolean value "AreImportCategoriesHidden"
    in the View class so I can see if a user has un-checked the "Show Imported Categories
    in this view" box however there doesn''t seem to be any way around it.


    If anyone can see something I''ve missed it would be great.


    Thanks'

    settable in 2015 which solves this problem.
