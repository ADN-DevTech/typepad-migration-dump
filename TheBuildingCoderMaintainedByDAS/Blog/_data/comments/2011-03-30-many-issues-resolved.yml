  body: 'hi Jeremy,


    great to have (dis)allow wall end joins feature in 2012 API, but what about join
    2 parallel adjacent walls?


    user can manually join it but looks like not available yet in API.


    hope don''t have to wait till 2013 API.


    cheers.

    I asked the development team, and there is not even a wish for this registered
    yet, so I submitted one for you. You are an ADN member, aren''t you? In future,
    it would be better to do this through a DevHelp Online request, actually. If you
    like, you can still do so, and I will hook up the wish list item I created with
    your case.

  body: "Dear Nitin,\n\nYes, of course you can do that. You can determine all families\
    \ in the document and set up a tree view using the functionality provided by Windows\
    \ and the .NET framework. You could classify the individual families by their\
    \ category, for instance. I think that would more or less match what the Revit\
    \ project browser does.\n\nFor an example of determining all families and the\
    \ symbols defined in them, you can look at \n\n<a href=\"http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2010/12/xml-family-usage-report.html\"\

    It is a pleasure!


    The Revit API does not provide any dedicated support for drag and drop. You may
    be able to simulate whatever user interactions Revit does support, or make use
    of iDrop. As always, first explore what the Revit user interface has to offer,
    and then ask yourself whether you can reproduce your required behaviour programmatically.

    The basic information on i-drop is available from the Autodesk Developer Center:

    To find information on using it with Revit family files, you can simply google
    for "i-drop revit family". That brings up a number of relevant hits for me.

  body: 'Dear Namit Jain,


    There are a number of ways to proceed. One is to read the geometry of all elements
    and collect the points from that. For greater efficiency, you may want to filter
    the points you find and only keep unique instances. This is demonstrated by various
    blog posts on geometry:


    <a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/geometry">http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/geometry</a>


    For instance, you can use the approach illustrated by the XyzEqualityComparer
    helper class and the way I make use of it in the GetVertices method in

    1. Thank you very much for your appreciation!


    2a. How do you create a model with these WallSweep objects to test?


    2b. Navigating up to the hosting wall sounds like a very good idea.


    2c. Have you used RevitLookup to explore your model, the wall sweeps, and their
    hosts? You can navigate and look interactively at all their relationships, geometry
    and location information yourself.

  body: The Autodesk Revit Architecture program lets architects and designers brainstorm
    and design their projects directly on their computer. If you wish to change something
    about the design, the program lets you issue revisions that are posted in the
    "Sheet Issues/Revisions" dialog. Once issued, a revision cannot be "deleted,"
    but it can be merged with another revision. Once a revision is merged, it no longer
    appears in the "Sheet Issues/Revisions" dialog and all of its information is lost,
    meaning the difference between deleting a revision and merging a revision is only
    nominal.

    bunch of work using the function of the layers to figure out where the core was

    Thank you for submitting this question as an ADN case 09454026 [Finding the Wall

    I and my colleagues will attend to it as soon as we possibly can.


    By the way, the Revit 2015 API includes some enhancements accessing stacked walls
    and the relationships between their components, so you should definitely take
    a look at that as soon as you can.


    Good luck!
