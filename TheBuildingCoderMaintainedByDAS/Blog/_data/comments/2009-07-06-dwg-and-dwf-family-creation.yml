  body: "Hi Jeremy,\n      Great article on the use of existing DWG/DWF content. I\
    \ am curious about how Revit stores the DWG/DWF geometry. Is it stored in their\
    \ native binary format, or converted to Revit elements during the import? If they\
    \ are stored in their native format, are there any consequences over the long\
    \ term for storing the objects this way. Is there a significant impoact on Revit\
    \ performance using this method, or recreating the objects from scratch in Revit."

  body: 'Dear Dave,


    Thank you, I am glad you like it. I am sorry to say that I honestly don''t know
    how this geometry is stored. As far as I know, there is no way at all to access
    it via the Revit API or otherwise. I also don''t know about the performance impact.
    It will obviously depend on the complexity. I would assume that simply storing
    and regenerating this static geometry is more performant than regenerating native
    parametrically defined Revit geometry, but this again might be more or less complex.


    For example, when defining a family for a complex three dimensional part, it will
    definitely enhance performance if you define different geometry for fine, medium
    and coarse representations, for instance a full solid model for fine, a couple
    of 3D bounding box quadrilaterals for medium, and a single line for the coarse
    representation.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: "Dear Jeremy,\n\nFirst of all, I have to say that I am enormously thankful\
    \ for your work and contribution to the community. I've learnt what I've learnt\
    \ on how to code Revit Add-ins, from ground zero, thanks to you. So, thank you.\
    \ :)\n\nI have a question in regards to the subject of this post. When you suggest\
    \ that the family can be created and loaded on the fly by using the .loadFamily\
    \ with the Document overload, that still means you need to create a new family\
    \ document, is that correct? And if so, you need to supply the new family document\
    \ with a valid template. What I am trying to achieve is pretty much the same as\
    \ the original poster - load DWG/DWF into a family file and load it to an open\
    \ document. And so the skeleton of the add-in is something like that:\n - create\
    \ new family document from a generic template\n - import the DWG/DWF information\
    \ inside of it\n - evaluate the information (2D/3D)\n - assign appropriate category\
    \ \n - load into the opened document\n\nAgain, thank you for your support to coding\
    \ toddlers like me. :D It is much appreciated.\n\nDeyan"

    Obviously you have to go through saving the new family somewhere.'

  body: 'Dear Deyan,


    Thank you very much for your nice appreciation.


    I am very glad it helped and you have made such good progress.


    I am also glad you found part of the answer in the other post.


    Thank you for letting us know.


    I am not sure that you really need to save the new family to a file anymore, though.


    In theory, it should always have been possible to create a new family definition
    in memory only and load the resulting document without ever saving it to disk.


    That did not work for a while, but it may do so now.


    Cheers, Jeremy.
