  body: 'Hi Jeremy


    This blog has proved very useful - many thanks.  One question...why does the added
    shared parameter always appear under the ''Other'' group (as shown above), even
    though one specifies a different definition group name via GetOrCreateSharedParamsGroup().  Is
    this by design?


    Thanks

    Thank you for your appreciation. I am very glad that you find it useful!


    I would say that shared parameters were created for end user interaction and simple
    uncomplicated use.


    The group name refers to the shared parameter file, I guess, and nothing else.


    The other categories in the list above are used by built-in and family parameters,
    I assume.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    so there''s no way to change existing shared parameter from under "Other" to under
    "Graphics", etc.?


    seems you can choose "Group" of shared parameter file for specific shared parameter,
    and change binding to specific categories, but not "Group parameter under:" of
    element properties as mentioned by Simon.


    thanks.

    Thank you and holiday cheers to you also.


    I am not an expert on shared parameters, viewing them more as a user feature than
    API functionality.


    I would tend to use extensible storage as much as possible for add-ins. However,
    since you want to make use of this data in schedules also, SPs make absolute sense,
    of course.


    The only thing I can think of suggesting is that you may need to integrate your
    own shared parameters into the existing SP file.


    Have a look at the CreateSharedParameter method used to create a shared parameter
    programmatically:


    <a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2009/06/model-group-shared-parameter.html">http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2009/06/model-group-shared-parameter.html</a>


    It checks the SharedParametersFilename. If that file exists, you can add your
    own shared parameters to it, otherwise create a new file from scratch.


    You seem to be doing only the latter, thus obliterating the existing ones.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    Thank you!


    For getting started with the Revit API, I would recommend looking at the getting
    started material first of all:

    I want to create a multi-category tag using a shared parameter. Can I accomplish
    this using API or are there any add-ons for such tasks? What is the reason that
    it is not possible to tag shared parameters? Your answer will be greatly appreciated.

  body: 'Dear Kesari,


    Basically, you almost never achieve anything programmatically in Revit that is
    not also doable in the user interface.


    Therefore, your question is basically user interface related and should be answered
    by some expert in that area.


    Cheers, Jeremy.
