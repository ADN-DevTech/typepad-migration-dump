    Thank you for the pointers. I was not aware of this possibility before, so I cannot

    I have only one question to ask you. Could be possible to add an horizontal separator

    thanks again

  body: 'Dear Martino,


    Looking through the Revit ribbon bar, I cannot see a single example of such a
    horizontal separator. Therefore, I would say that even if you could insert such
    a thing, I would recommend you not to do so. But of course the API does not provide
    this possibility anyway. Basically, the example above demonstrates everything
    that can be done. The AddSeparator method adds a separator, and it is vertical.
    To my knowledge, horizontal separators do not exist in the ribbon.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    As I said above to Martino, as far as I know, the API currently does not provide
    this possibility. Basically, the example above demonstrates everything that can
    be done with ribbons through the API. The AddSeparator method adds a separator,
    but only a vertical one.

  body: Here's a good question.  Does the API support a method to add an Extended
    tool tip?  The regular text tool tip is nice, but the Interface shows it's own
    commands using an extended tool tip for the user that contains a help file like
    image and text snippit.  Can this be done in 2010?

    Are you talking about Revit 2010 or 2011? In 2011, I have not really had a look
    at that area yet, so I don''t know what the problem might be. In 2010, there has
    been some discussion on the topic of greyed out commands now and then, which we
    summarised in


    <a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2009/06/rfa-version-grey-commands-family-context-and-rdb-link.html#2">http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2009/06/rfa-version-grey-commands-family-context-and-rdb-link.html#2</a>


    Jean-François Breton added some explanations to the comments there as well.


    Furthermore, Mr. Navarra already asked this question repeatedly:

    Are you still stuck with that? How terrible!

    \ AEC workgroup. It also assigns a case number which makes it easier to coordinate\
    \ with our internal knowledgebase and other databases.\n\nRegarding your question,\
    \ add-ins are indeed restricted to adding controls to two of the ribbon tabs:\
    \ the Add-Ins and the Analyse tabs. Here are some quotes from the developer guide\
    \ \"Revit 2011 API Developer Guide.pdf\" regarding this:\n\n- 3.2.1 Loading and\
    \ Running External Commands: You can add External Commands to the External Tools\
    \ Panel under the External Tools menu-button, or as a custom ribbon panel on the\
    \ Add-Ins tab. \n\n- 3.8 Ribbon Panels and Controls: Custom ribbon panels will\
    \ appear on the Add-Ins tab in Revit by default, but they can also be added to\
    \ the Analyze tab.\n\n- 3.8.2 Ribbon Panel: Custom ribbon panels can be added\
    \ to the Add-Ins tab (the default) or the Analyze tab.\n\nTo add a panel to the\
    \ Analyze tab, use the CreateRibbonPanel method overload taking an additional\
    \ Tab enumeration argument.\n\nCheers, Jeremy."

    To explain the above scenario....when I open any file and goes to View Menu ->
    3D View -> Camera and creates View using Camera....at that time Revit disables
    the Add-Ins Panel and My Add-Ins gets disabled.....while I can still export the
    same view using IFC Option from Menu. Could you please help in this.
