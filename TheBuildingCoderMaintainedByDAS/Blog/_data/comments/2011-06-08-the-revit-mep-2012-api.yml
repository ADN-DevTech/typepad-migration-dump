  body: 'Hi Jeremy,

    I wanted to know whether it is possible to edit electrical family components like
    panels and transformers using revit api. I have a revit file having these and
    I want to programatically change their configurations eg. from 200KVA panel to
    a 100KVA panel.'

  body: 'Dear Akash,


    Yes, this is certainly possible.


    This data is stored in generic Revit element parameters that can be accessed and
    modified programmatically.


    You can research which parameters you need to access using the RevitLookup database
    exploration tool or other more in-depth API exploration methods:

    Some examples of accessing and modifying Revit MEP relevant parameters are provided
    by my AdnRme sample add-in:
