  body: After some further thought, one of our developers says that it sounds feasible
    to deploy the addin utility in GAC. It may still be better to copy it to the install
    package, since that can avoid problems in case Revit has not been installed at
    all on the target machine or the add-in utility is not found in the GAC. So you
    might want to check first whether it is in GAC and then run the local installer
    version otherwise.

  body: 'I am trying to create a single installer for both 32 bit and 64 bit but it
    seems that RevitAddInUtility.dll is compiled for x64 in the 64 bit install and
    x86 in the 32 bit install.


    Is there an Any CPU compilation?


    Or am I just missing something?'

  body: 'Dear Joel,


    In general, since you are an ADN member, submitting an ADN DevHelp Online request
    is the safer way to go to obtain an answer, because my colleagues will see it
    as well as me. In addition, that automatically hooks up to our knowledgebase.


    I have asked the development team about this, and their response is that a request
    will need to be filed.


    So for the moment, I think you will have to live with the two separate versions
    for 32 and 64 bits.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: I just wanted to say that the new way to register an Add-In (via RevitAddinUtility)
    is simply awesome. So you understand why I say that having to cope with two versions
    (32 & 64 bit), having to copy the right dll or having to include it in my msi
    or having to resort to any other trick simply negates the above mentioned awesomeness.

    Shall we agree on "mitigates"?


    There are already known effective work-arounds, and we are looking into a purer
    long-term solution:

  body: 'Hi Jeremy,


    I agree with you, there are several effective workarounds - this is not the issue.
    I was so amazed when RevitAddInUtility got out that in my eyes the trouble of
    using workarounds looked very big (although it''s not); it''s like having a very
    very nice cake without the cherry on top. It''s so very easy to use (when developing)
    only that it''s not (when installing the product).


    I don''t want to offend anyone, on the contrary. I can''t wait for the long-term
    solution.


    By the way, I didn''t expected your answer. I want to use this opportunity to
    thank you for your posts, you got me out of my trouble several time.'

    Thank you for the clarification, and no offense taken, don''t worry.


    Yes, I am looking forward to the perfect long-term solution as well. I like the
    cherry on the top!


    Thank you for your appreciation!

    \ class as an external command implementation class, in which case it would have\
    \ to be derived from IExternalCommand and implement an Execute method, which it\
    \ does not. \n\nUse of the IExternalCommandAvailability interface only makes sense\

    \ Where is this command? That is what Revit is looking for and what is specified\
    \ for loading in the add-in manifest.\n\nCheers, Jeremy."
