  body: "Dear Harry, \n\nI implemented an external command using the sample code you\
    \ provided and was also initially unable to interpret the resulting coordinates\
    \ returned by the View Outline property. According to the documentation, it returns\
    \ the bounds of the view in paper space in inches. Running the code in a simple\
    \ sample drawing did return something that looked vaguely reasonable:\n\nCoordinates\
    \ of FloorPlan view 'Level 1': (-0.88,-0.88)\nCoordinates of FloorPlan view 'Level\
    \ 2': (-0.58,-0.38)\nCoordinates of Elevation view 'North': (-0.62,-0.06)\nCoordinates\
    \ of Elevation view 'East': (-0.45,-0.06)\n\nOn closer inspection, however, these\
    \ coordinate values have no discernable relationship with the actual position\
    \ of the views on the sheet.\n\nI checked with my colleagues, and received the\
    \ answer that you are not doing anything wrong, but unfortunately there is currently\
    \ simply no API access to this information. Sorry for the bad news!\n\nThe information\
    \ returned by View.Outline is not wrong in any way, it is just describing the\
    \ size of the view and returning the bounding box of the origin of the view, not\
    \ its position on the sheet.\n\nCheers, Jeremy."

  body: Thanks for that answer.  At least I won't spend any more time trying to figure
    this one out.  IT would be nice, in a future version of the API to be able to
    do this.  I have 50+- typical sheets in our library and if I could programaticaly
    extract the position of the views, then I could use my complimentary routine to
    rebuild the sheets when view in the library is updated.  I wrote a program to
    do this with the locations stored in an XML data file.  So all our users can dynamically
    create typical sheets for their projects using the latest versions of our details.  Pre
    assembled sheets are static and a pain to maintain / update as time goes on.

    to dynamically create the typical sheets in a project will be completely automated.


    Unless there is a way to put all the drafting views into a family file.  Then
    I could use the currently available API functions to do this.'

    any new info around this thread? Will it come with 2012?


    I urgently need the coordinates of each view on a certain sheet.


    Unfortunately I searched quite a long time until I had the idea to search in your
    blog.


    Kind regards, Thomas'

    There is no public information at all about any future versions of any products
    whatsoever that I know about.


    When you say ''2012'', I must answer that I have no idea what you are talking
    about.


    I am glad you thought about searching the blog, though. I try to make all information
    that I come across available here. It always applies exclusively to existing public
    versions, of course. I hope it won''t take you so long to think of it next time
    you need something  :-)


    Wish list items are better handled by an ADN request, though.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: 'Hi Jeremy,


    I know this is an old thread but I didnt find any thread that similar with my
    problem.

    I want to insert an image on the sheet programatically based on the origin (0,
    0, 0) at the bottom left. I knew from your blog that the sheet not provide the
    information about coordinate.

    So to get the exact location for my image, I play around with the coordinate value
    until I get the correct position which is at top right. I have to hardcoded all
    the position for each type of sheet.

    My question is:

    Is there any possibility that the origin are different between type of sheet or
    if user create their own sheet?


    Thank you.

    Abby'

  body: "Hi Jeremy,\n\nI can't figure out a way to get a handle on a Viewport's *title*\
    \ so as to resize or move it on the ViewSheet (note: I'm referring to the viewport's\
    \ *title*, not the viewport itself)\nA worrying fact is that there's no elementID\
    \ on the title symbol:\n- go to a sheet with at least a viewport whose type defines\
    \ a title symbol, \n- click on the title so as to highlight it\n- use Revit's\
    \ \"Element ID\" to try to reveal its ID\n- but it comes back empty!\n\nI suspect\
    \ that Viewport title is a <i>private member of the Viewport class</i> and the\
    \ API does not expose anything about it. Shouldn't it at least expose methods\
    \ to manipulate 1) the title's position and 2) the title line's length? \n\nWarm\
