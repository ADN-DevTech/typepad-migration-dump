  body: 'Hello Jeremy,

    Thank you for your wonderful site.

    Is there a way to export a model (to DXF for example) without objects temporarily
    hidden in the view, without having to click the dialog box that appears and gives
    me the option whether to export the hidden objects or not? I understand that using
    view filters I can''t hide objects.

    I''m using the 2014 API with C#.NET

    Thank you!'

    Thank you for your appreciation.


    Look at all these topics that I collected for you on detecting and handling dialogues
    and failures:

    Especially, look at how to suppress an unwanted dialogue:
