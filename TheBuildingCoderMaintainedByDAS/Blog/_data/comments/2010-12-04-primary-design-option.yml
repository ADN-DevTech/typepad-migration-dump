  body: "Dear Jeremy,\nI have a question about 'Cut Geometry' functionality. \nTo\
    \ give you more insight about the question, here is a little background: I am\
    \ creating a decorative screen wall (with a lot of perforations/geometric shapes\
    \ made out of voids)which accompanies the windows in a courtyard wall. In order\
    \ for me to create these voids i need them to intersect with the host wall. First\
    \ I tried to use voidextrusions to use 'CombinableElements' property, but unfortunately\
    \ it did not allow me to cast the wall as element. The other option I tried was\
    \ to get geometry proper of wall and get solid to use 'SolidSolidCutUtils.AddCutBetweenSolids'\
    \ method, but now I am having difficulty in using extrusion to use this method.\
    \ Is there any better way of accomplishing this?"

  body: 'Dear Sami,


    The Revit API help file contains the following statement regarding the AddCutBetweenSolids
    error, which I personally do not find very clearly formulated:


    "The element must be in a conceptual model, pattern based curtain panel, or adaptive
    component family -or- The element does not meet the condition that it must be
    solid and must be a GenericForm, GeomCombination, or a FamilyInstance."


    As far as I can tell, that can be simplified to "The element must be in a conceptual
    model, pattern based curtain panel, or adaptive component family -or- it must
    be solid and its class must be GenericForm, GeomCombination, or FamilyInstance."


    Unfortunately, the wall does not fulfil this requirement, so AddCutBetweenSolids
    cannot be used on it.


    CombineElements will not work either, because Wall is not a subclass of the CombinableElement
    class.


    As of now, we have no additional capability in this area.


    So I am sorry to say that you cannot add a void to the wall itself through the
    API, even though it is possible through the user interface.


    If the wall were a standard family, you could go into its family definition, search
    for the wall''s main parametric solid, e.g. an Extrusion or something, and add
    a void to that. Unfortunately, being a system family, this is not possible.


    Maybe you can define your ''hole in the wall'' as a standard family, like a window?
    Or use a plain opening element?


    I hope this helps.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: 'Hi Jeremy,


    I''m wondering if there''s any ways to get design option set. For example, if
    a room belongs to a design option, the parameter of the Design Option in the room
    indicates "Option Set 1: Option 1", but I cannot access to the design option set,
    Option Set 1, which includes the design option, Option 1. Please let me know if
    there''s a class like DesignOptionSet. Thank you for your help in advance.

    I would start out by looking at the DesignOptionReader SDK sample, if I were you.

    I''m looking at a way to know which Design Option used by user in an active view
    and then to filter elements to have only elements which are in the used design
    option.

    Thanks for your help in advance.

  body: 'Dear MejdiM,


    I don''t know about the active view. You would have to explore that for yourself.
    Please let us know the solution. Retrieving the elements should be achievable
    using an ElementDesignOptionFilter, or the BuiltInParameter.DESIGN_OPTION_PARAM
    and a parameter filter.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    I discussed this with the development team, and unfortunately there seems to be
    no way to read information about the option sets, including option set membership.

  body: 'Dear MejdiM,


    You can combine the results of several individual filtered element collectors,
    or filter the result of one collector with a given list of element ids.


    So you should be able to integrate the results you list above with the current
    user selection.


    Cheers, Jeremy.
