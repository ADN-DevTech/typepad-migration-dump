  body: 'Hey Jeremy,


    I am attempting to use the ViewDrafting.Create() method for a Revit 2015 add-in.
    Unfortunately, I am a bit confused about its implementation. I understand that
    the method requires a reference to the active document as well as a reference
    to an ElementId viewFamilyTypeId. The document is fairly straightforward but I
    can''t seem to figure out how to retrieve a reference to a drafting view type
    ID. I have experimented with ViewType.DraftingView, the ViewFamilyType class,
    and what little other documentation I was able to find online (a majority of available
    documentation is dedicated to the pre-2015 method). Could you possibly provide
    a quick example of how to generate this method parameter? Any help would be greatly
    appreciated!


    All the best,

    Jacob Johnson'

  body: 'Dear Jacob,


    You can retrieve the view family type id from some other drafting view, if you
    happen to have one handy, or from the document via a filtered element collector.


    There are lots of samples how to do this in the topic groups on setting up section
    and 3D views:
