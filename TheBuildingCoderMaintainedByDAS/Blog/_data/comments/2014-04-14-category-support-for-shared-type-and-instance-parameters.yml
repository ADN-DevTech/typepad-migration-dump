  body: 'Hi Jeremy,


    I would like to create a combobox as a parameter, which would appear in my family
    properties window. So that the user can choose, let''s say, between option 1,
    option 2 , and option 3. I tried to use a yes/no checkbox for each option but
    i ended up with a lot of checkboxes and it allowed the user to make impossible
    cases (like checking all 3 options). I''ve noticed the combobox data class but
    from what i understand it''s just for the ribbon. Do you have suggestions regarding
    this?


    Thanks.'

  body: 'Dear Michael,


    I am afraid that the Revit API currently does not support this.


    All I can suggest right now is to create your own user interface for that using
    a .NET form, and transfer the user settings from it to the Revit element read-only
    parameter or extensible storage data.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'
