  body: 'It was nostalgic to see roomba in action

    One time i put the roomba in the entrance to clean and when it was silent and
    i went out to move it, it was gone. I thought someone from the street have been
    in to steal it. Later on i found it in the bedroom it must somehow have puched
    open the door and then somehow have pushed it closed Again.

    Roomba versus ordinary vacuum cleaner

    Long time ago I have made a test to see if a roomba or a vacuum cleaner cleans
    best.

    The entrance have two types of materials on the floor, tile and wood floors, some
    tiles are covered by 2 large doormats.I first used the ordinary vacuum cleaner
    to clean entrance. (no shaking or beating the doormats outside, just  vacuum clean.)
    Then i empty the roomba''s dust container and started roomba to clean entrance.
    After roomba was done cleaning entrance, then I looked in roomba''s dust container
    and I found some dust and small stones. I gues roomba is better to clean doormats
    than ordinary vacum cleaner, I assume the dust and small stone came from the doormats,
    since nothing was visible at the floor when roomba started to clean.

    Other purpos of roomba

    The roomba have other use than clean floors, it can be used as some kind of entertaining
    nanny or toy for kids. My son have spend alot of hours sitting in his bed watching
    the roomba clean his room. He have also made som kind of test, he have cut som
    very small pices of paper to throw on floor, also throw when roomba is driving
    arround. The only thing stopping him is when roomba runs out of power. When it
    was new i think it was close to 1,5 hour of batery time and at the end like 45
    minutes.

    A long time ago I saw a website where some have build an arm with lego mindsstorm
    to put on top of a robot cleaner like roomba, i dont remember if it was a roomba
    or some other kind. They used the arm to move objects from the path of the robot
    cleaner. The thought of it is very nice no more moving shoes or toys.'
