  body: "Hi Jeremy, \n\nReally sorry to miss the training in Melbourne and glad to\
    \ see you saw some of the great south west (it's very close to where I grew up).\
    \  Glad to hear it was a great success and fingers crossed for next time.\n\n\
    Interesting you were discussing synchronization, it's an issue I'm about to start\
    \ tackling with my IFC importer.  Rhino objects are saved similar to revit with\
    \ a guid (there's no way to enforce your own to ensure uniqueness).  Grasshopper\
    \ doesn't unless you implement your own system.  IFC also has the guid (with it's\
    \ own string syntax).  My first question on this topic is can I store the IFC\
    \ guid on an object created in a way consistent with the Revit importer?  Parameter\
    \ pr = f.get_Parameter(BuiltInParameter.IFC_GUID); returns null, and I haven't\
    \ worked out how to create it yet (apologies if it's my ignorance)."

  body: 'Dear Jon,


    Sorry you missed it too, it would have been great to have you!


    I''m not planning on any regular visits, though, sorry, too far  :-)


    I can''t tell for sure whether this will help in your context, but you might want
    to have a look at the ExportUtils.GetExportId method.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: 'Dear Nick,


    Well, for me it was 12 h to Singapore and 8 hr from there to Melbourne, plus a
    wait of a couple of hours in between.


    I enjoyed providing it, and I enjoyed yours very much as well. It felt like we
    could have spent a month at it and still have more to look at!


    Looking forward very much to seeing what you come up with.


    Cheers, Jeremy.
