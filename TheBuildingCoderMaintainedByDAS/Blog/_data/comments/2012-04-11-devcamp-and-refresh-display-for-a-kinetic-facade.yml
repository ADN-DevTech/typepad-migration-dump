    \ not work, ie. having modifed object styles of categories, the active view does\

    \ \n\nPerhaps you could let the development team know. I'm using 2013 UR1."

  body: 'Dear Andreas,


    Sorry to hear that it does not work in that environment, and thank you for letting
    us know.


    Would you mind submitting a DevHelp Online request to report the issue officially?


    That would make it simpler for us to manage.


    Thank you!


    Cheers, Jeremy.
