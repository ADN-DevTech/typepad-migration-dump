  body: 'Hi Jeremy,


    Sorry in advance if this isn''t the best place and method to ask the following
    question. HOw difficult would it be to write a plug in for Revit that would listen
    for the mouse double click event and issue a view command such as Zoom All, like
    in AutoCAD? Warm regards from Los Angeles,

  body: 'Hi Jeremy,



    Please post a general, high level outline of the path for the solution. Something
    like this but a bit more detailed:



    Input

    Create a program that listens for mouse actions/events when Revit has the focus,
    so the mouse is ignored when other programs have it.




    Process

    When the double click event occurs inside Revit run Output function below

    Otherwise ignore mouse input and pass control back to Revit



    Output


    Issue a Zoom All to Fit (ZA) command and pass control back to Revit



    Im concerned the method Im proposing would slow things down. I hope Im missing
    a method that simply reacts to double clicks so it does not become a bottle neck.




    Warm regards from Los Angeles,



    Emmanuel'

    Thank you for the proposal. Sounds like a neat project to me. Unfortunately, I
    am fully occupied keeping my daytime job and this blog running, so I currently
    do not see any spare time left over to pick this up. Good luck!


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    Im working on it. I will let you know when I get stuck again. If I figure it out,
    I will be happy to share the solution with the entire Revit community. Warm regards
    from Los Angeles,

    Is it possible to find the GUIDs for native Family Params (the default params
    that one cannot delete, etc)? The ones that we need are for the new Omniclass
    Params (2010 on) so that we may add them as Shared Params in 2009 Families.'

    Are you sure that a native family parameter has a GUID at all? I am not.

    Do you know if it is possible to specify the shared parameter GUID to be used
    when initially creating a shared parameter?  I would like the GUID to be the same
    for a particular shared parameter if created on say more than one PC.


    Best regards

    Yes, I believe this is possible by specifying the shared parameter you want to
    create in an external shared parameter text file, which allows you to list the
    GUID as well.


    I have heard of people using this technique to generate language specific shared
    parameters with different names for different locales yet sharing the same GUID.


    If you succeed in using this technique, it might be interesting to explain the
    exact steps for sharing with others. Thank you!


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    Thank you for the appreciation and suggestion, and rest assured that we have a
    wish list item for the ability to specify the shared parameter GUID programmatically.

  body: 'I would think that if the format of the Shared Parameter.txt changed in the
    future then it would be easy enough to paste the info across to the new format
    or use it as the basis of a lookup file if adding GUIDs programmatically? I therefore
    see little risk in adopting this strategy.


    Coping the .txt file would allow language specific flavours to be created by manual
    edits of the pameter name & parameter group.


    Thanks for the code snippets above... we have somehow mislaid a Guid on some well
    established families.
