    and an external application?  Do both run in the same process space as Revit?

  body: "Dear J,\n\nAt an operating system level, the difference between an external\
    \ command and an external application is small. They both run in the same process\
    \ space as Revit, and are called by Revit in a specific context. \n\nThe external\
    \ application implements methods OnStartup and OnShutdown, which are called when\
    \ Revit itself starts up and shuts down. \n\nThe external command implements a\
    \ method named Execute, which is called when the user launches the command.\n\n\
    Both can define additional call-backs, cf.\n\n<a href=\"http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2010/04/asynchronous-api-calls-and-idling.html\"\
