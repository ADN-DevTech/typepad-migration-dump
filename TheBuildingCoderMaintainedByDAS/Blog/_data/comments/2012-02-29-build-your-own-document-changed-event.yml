  body: 'Salve Jeremy,


    I would call it OnDocumentSwitched() ;-)


    My humble contribution:

    Switching between Documents happens only if


    e.PreviousActiveView.PathName != e.CurrentActiveView.PathName


    Otherwise it is just switching between Views.



    Cheers,

    Rudolf'

  body: Regarding ViewActivated event, apparently this is not called when user activates
    a viewport in a sheet, thus changing the ActiveView.  Is there any way around
    this to know when user has activated a viewport?  Thanks.
