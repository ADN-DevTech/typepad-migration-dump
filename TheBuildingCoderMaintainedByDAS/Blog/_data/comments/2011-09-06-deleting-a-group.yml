  body: 'Hi Jeremy,


    this seems to be related to the topic "setting the name of a Group".


    In fact, we need to name the *GroupType* instead of the Group itself:


    Group group = doc.Create.NewGroup(elementSet);

    group.GroupType.Name = "MyGroup";


    It''s just analogous.


    Cheers,

    Rudolf'

    I want to add that GroupType names must be unique, so before naming it, make sure
    that there is no other GroupType of this name.


    But that doesn''t belong to the current theme, in fact.



    Bye,

    Rudolf'
