    Is there any way we can use this new functionality to rename shared parameters?

  body: 'Dear Brad,


    I don''t really believe any of the new functionality affects the handling of shared
    parameters. If you really need to, I am sure there are ways to achieve this with
    existing functionality, however. There may be more effective methods, but if the
    worst come to the worst, you could export all the values of an existing shared
    parameter into a temporary storage mapping each element id to its shared parameter
    value, delete the shared parameter in the project file, create a new shared parameter
    with the updated name, and repopulate the values again. I can well imagine that
    there are also other much simpler and more efficient methods of achieving this.

    Thanks for the link and info.

    Quick Q.

    There is an Update 2, Subscription Release Pack and several Hot Fixes... Is there
    anywhere on the web that explains the correct install order for these (and whether
    there is overlap)?

    This is quite confusing and not well documented that I can find.'

  body: 'Hi Jeremy,

    I am creating a custom Tag Family (i.e. for a room) and want to associate some
    shared parameter of the Room elements to some of the labels of this custom tag
    family so that it would show the parameter values when being placed inside a room.

    Using the Family API of Revit SDK 2010, I''ve created the the Tag Family (based
    on the family template: Generic Tag.rft) successfully. However, I am stuck when
    trying to associate a shared parameter with a "Label" (just like we can do that
    in the Revit Family Editor). I see a Label property in Dimension and LinearArray
    class but these annotations are not what I need. I could not create a new Label
    which is a System Family. Does the SDK support to do that or not? If the answer
    is yes, would you please give me some hints?

    I really appreciate your help.

  body: 'Dear Tam,


    I think the answer is no.


    There is no API to create a label for the annotation symbol, and also no API to
    access the label property of the existing label.


    Its parameter type is invalid, as you can see using RvtMgdDbg to snoop a TextElement
    object and looking at its parameters. The InternalDefinition of its Label parameter
    has an invalid parameter type.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: 'Dear Tam,


    I am glad that you found a workable solution. That makes sense to me.


    Regarding the hyperlink issue, one easy thing that you could implement would be
    a two-click process. Implement an external command and an external application
    which implements its own panel hosting the command button. Float that panel on
    the graphics area. The user can click the button, launching the command, and then
    click the text note which is actually a hyperlink. Within the command, you read
    the URL contents of the text note and launch a browser for it.


    That''s the best I can think of off-hand that really easily fits into the available
    functionality.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: 'Dear Jeremy,

    Thanks for your solution regarding the hyperlink issue; however, I can imagine
    that your two-click process only works in Revit, which is not actually what I
    need. Maybe I haven''t described this issue clearly. I would like to clarify it
    again. I need the real hyperlinks in an published DWF file. When the DWF is opened
    in the web browser or the DWF Viewer, the user can see the hyperlinks there and
    click on a hyperlink to navigate to another web page. A possible way is to use
    the DWF C++ Toolkit to modify the DWF file after being published by Revit. I wonder
    if we have an easier/better way to achieve this goal without much effort. Do you
    have any idea about it? I hope Revit will support this feature in its next release.


    Cheers,
