  body: 'Hi Jeremy, hi Victor,


    after reading the command IDs, I assume they can be used with UI Automation.

    For example,

    ID_ANNOTATIONS_DIMENSION_ALIGNED

    can be found in the status bar text in this screen shot:

    <a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/.a/6a00e553e1689788330147e270f039970b-popup">http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/.a/6a00e553e1689788330147e270f039970b-popup</a>


    So after *knowing* all command IDs, we could also *invoke* all commands:

    Cheers,

  body: 'Hi Jeremy,


    I really doubt if overwriting existing functions should be done at all.


    There are cases in which a plugin can affect the behaviour of the whole application,
    e.g. when using RegisterFailuresProcessor().

    In the worst case, it may be that one of your installed plugins suppresses all
    warnings and errors, avoiding you from performing the needed error solution even
    manually.


    When overwriting existing functions, it may be that the user doesn''t even know
    that he uses a replacement function, depending on the documentation you shipped
    with your plugin.



    Cheers,

    Rudolf'

    First you need to activate the keyboards shortcuts through the Revit UI by going
    to ribbon -> View -> User Interface -> keyboard shortcuts.


    Add a shortcut and that will create the shortcuts file.  I hope that helps.'

    I guess they thought that you can do more with the EditFamily API method, and
    using OpenAndActivateDocument to navigate.


    Or there were other internal reasons for not exposing such a complicated command  :-)

    So you could use the commandBinding then run a eventhandler to show the dialog,
    could you then have the original command run after the user clicks OK on the warning
    box?


    or is that a different process than commandbinding? Is there a process to catch
    when standard Revit commands are run and do things alongside the command?'
