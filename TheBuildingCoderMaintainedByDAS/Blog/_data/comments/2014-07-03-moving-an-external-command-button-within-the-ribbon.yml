  body: Wow this is interesting.  Over the years I have had many requests by people
    if we could disable the explode command.  Now I'm assuming we could remove that
    button altogether from the ribbon?  I wonder how this works on contextual panels???

  body: 'Yes you can indeed remove the explode buttons (I tried it out) and they stay
    removed for the remainder of the Revit session. The trick is to catch them while
    they are showing, I did it by selecting an imported cad file to bring up the context
    panel and then ran an external command that searches for the buttons and removes
    them, it''s a manual process though.


    For automation I think it would be possible to place the seek and remove code
    into an IExternalCommandAvailability class associated with an API button that
    has been added to the modify tab. It would then get triggered automatically along
    with the display of the contextual panel. The button could then even remove itself
    once it has done its job (the perfect crime).


    There''s probably a race condition though, as the explode buttons might not always
    be added before the availability checker is triggered, but its worth a try.'

    LocationCurve loc = pipe.Location as LocationCurve;

    XYZ startp = loc.Curve.GetEndPoint(0);

    XYZ endp = loc.Curve.GetEndPoint(1);

  body: 'I''ve got some code working based on this article. The code loops through
    an xml file and sets ribbonItem.IsVisible per button in my addin. This works for
    all of my buttons except for a PullDownButton. The buttons that are added to the
    PullDownButton aren''t included as items in RibbonPanel.Source.Items. Any idea
    how to get the buttons in the PullDownButton that is found in there?


    Thanks'

  body: '@ TroyGates.  If the button is PullDownButton you should be able to cast
    it to a PullDownButton.  Then use the GetItems() method to get an IList<PushButton>
    that you can then iterate through to set the visibility.  I''ve implemented this
    in an addin before.
