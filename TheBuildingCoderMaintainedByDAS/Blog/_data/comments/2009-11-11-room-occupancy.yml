    Your blog is really useful for me. May I ask you a question, the default color
    is great, and I want to know how to switch the color to other. Thanks'

    Great to hear that the blog is useful to you.


    Did you see my answer to your previous question?

    Here is what I had to say then, and I am not much the wiser today:


    Regarding the colour settings, I do not know how to set line colour completely
    freely. In Revit, things are generally managed in a systematic and parametric
    manner, which ensures that the model remains well structured. In this case, you
    can modify model line colours by changing line style settings. I did the following
    to test this:


    - Create a couple of model lines


    - For each one of these, right click for the context menu and select Element Properties...
    > Line style and pick a different line style.


    - Right click somewhere in empty space in the current view to bring up the view
    context menu, and select View Properties... > Visibility/Graphics Overrides >
    Edit... > Model Categories > Visibility and search for the Lines entry. Click
    on the little plus sign to display the lines subcategories.


    - For each of the line styles you selected above, find the corresponding subcategory
    and change the colour displayed in its Projection/Surface Lines column.


    In addition to this, there are also two posts that deal with the colour of Revit
    elements:

    I hope this helps.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: 'Dear Jeremy,


    I went through above reply for Room Occupancy type and Construction. I got your
    solution for room occupancy. But for the construction, You have suggested to use
    Revit MEP. We have Revit Architecture 2010 only and we dont have Revit MEP installed.
    Moreover, our plug in is for Revit Architecture 2010 only. Can you please tell
    us how we can find it for Revit Architecture 2010 using Revit API


    Regards,

    Shifali'

    \nNor have I tried to access the element myself using a simple element filter.\
    \ I suggest you do that yourself and let us know what you find out. Thank you!\

  body: This is impressive. I've been searching for tutorials like this for almost
    a week and i tend to not understand all of them except your post. It's a good
    thing you made it in a step by step process. Thanks.
