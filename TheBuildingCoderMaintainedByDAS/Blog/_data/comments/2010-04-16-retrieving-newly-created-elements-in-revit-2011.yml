    Interesting ideas, maybe I''m missing something but doesn''t the DocumentChanged
    event and the added elementId''s collection solve the generic problem of new element
    discovery?


    Cheers, Guy'

    Thank you very much for pointing that out! I was caught up in porting and comparing,
    and switched off my real-world thinking. I added a note above to make sure this
    important aspect is not missed.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    I am creating my own custom Family through code. But It is not showing 3D view.
    Can you tell me how we can do this.'

  body: 'Actually, I disagree that your method is superfluous because of the DocumentChanged
    event--I need to grab the newly mirrored object right away to manipulate it in
    the immediate/current context, and your method works perfectly for me (in 2012,
    BTW).


    Thanks! Chuck'

    Great to hear that, I am glad that you are able to make effective use of this.


    A completely clean and above all officially supported solution would also be to
    make use of DMU, the dynamic model update mechanism, you know.


    A fully fleshed out example of using the DocumentChanged event to determine the
    newly added elements is provided here:

    And, as you say, and unlike DMU, the DocumentChanged event is only called after
    the transaction adding the elements has been closed.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    for simple Mirror Command for one element , I used to use the Last() element from
    the Collector.ToElemnts() returned list instead of looping through the entire
    returned collector list.'
