  body: "Jeremy,\n\nThanks again for you response.  It definitely worked as expected.\
    \  One note of caution is if you family is using connectors that are face based\
    \ on the geometry.  As you mentioned above, deleting the geometry will cause anything\
    \ hosted to it to be deleted as well.  \n\nTo work around this, I took the normal\
    \ vector, origin, connector shape, and radius/(height and width) to create a new\
    \ extrusion that was only large enough to fit the connector.  Then I could place\
    \ a new connector on the newly created extrusion.  Final result was the geometry\
    \ removed with floating slivers of extrusions with the connectors on them.\n\n\
    Other side note:\n\nI am now working for www.CADworks.net in case anyone wanted\
    \ to get in touch with me.\n\nThanks,\n\nJoel"

  body: 'Jeremy,


    Looking through forums today I think it is safe to say that your blog is considered
    one of the best if not the best resource for Revit API.  Which got me to wondering
    why there aren''t more comments on your blogs.


    Are most people posting questions regarding your blog directly through ADN?


    Maybe you are just to clear in your posts and leave no room for questions haha.


    Whatever the case, I just had some fun creating new families and came across an
    interesting side effect.  As far as I know, when you create a new family through
    the API, there is no active view so even though it is open in a Revit session,
    there is no view to close it.  A pretty simple fix was just creating a new view
    for the family.


    Anyone else run into this?


    Joel'

  body: 'Dear Joel,


    Wow, thank you very much for your appreciation! I hope I am being clear, at least
    I am doing my best. Also, I would actually find it hard to cope with much more
    comments than I already receive.


    That is an interesting observation about the open family document with no views.
    What happens if you call Document.Close?


    Cheers, Jeremy.
