    I can not figure out how to do as stated in the recommendations:

    "You can programmatically ungroup, make the change, regroup and then swap the
    other instances of the old group to the new group to get the same effect."


    Please, can you give simple example?'

    It took me a while, but I got around to it. I just published a new sample to answer
    your question:

    Wow, that is very interesting and useful information.


    I keep hearing of new issues where some twiddling of transactions and regeneration
    helps.


    A well balanced mixture of technique, art and magic.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    I believe that you will have to ungroup and regroup to achieve that.


    Cheers, Jeremy.
