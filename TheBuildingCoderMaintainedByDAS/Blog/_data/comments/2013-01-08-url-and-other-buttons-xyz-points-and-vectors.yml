  body: 'Dear Ahmed Ali,


    I would suggest that you simply implement and associate a separate external command
    for each ribbon button, as explained above.


    Then the command will identify the button.


    What is the problem with that?


    I would not recommend using the unsupported option unless you are capable of exploring
    it on your own.


    Please answer through the DevHelp Online system, responding directly to the case,
    so that we can keep the discussion in one place.


    Thank you!


    Cheers, Jeremy.
