  body: 'Nice work, thanks for putting the sample together. I have a quick question
    which I thought you may be able to help answer.


    I am still on the 2012 version and as you may guess I have trouble with getting
    the material from Id. I tried changing the relevant code to ''e.Document.Settings.Materials.get_item(face.MaterialElementId''),
    however it throws an error at run time. Can you suggest how would I get an element''s
    material for the 2012 libraries.


    Thanks

    I guess you get the NullReferenceException. The problem describes here <a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2011/08/retrieving-materials.html#comment-6a00e553e1689788330162fde14500970d">http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2011/08/retrieving-materials.html#comment-6a00e553e1689788330162fde14500970d</a>

  body: "Jeremy,\n\nThank you for doing this. I have found it to be very useful as\
    \ we are working on deploying revit models in an augmented reality environment\
    \ using Junaio. Obj is on of the supported geometry formats.\nI have discovered\
    \ however that sketch based stairs will not export. The new component based stairs\
    \ will export as long as they are not multistory,\nIt would also be helpful to\
    \ use the actual Revit material names instead of a generated one. I plan to amend\
    \ your code to support this however I don,t know how to fix the stair problem.\
    \ Any ideas would be appreciated.\n\nMany thanks \nMark"

    Thank you for your appreciation. I am very glad it is useful for you.


    To fix the stair problem, you might want to have a look at the other official
    Revit geometry exporters and explore how they tackle it:

    You should also definitely look at the later improved versions of the OBJ exporter
    as well before you start adapting anything for your own use:

    Cheers, Jeremy.
