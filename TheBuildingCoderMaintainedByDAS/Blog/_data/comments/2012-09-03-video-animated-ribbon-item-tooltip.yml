    since AutoCAD and Revit share some sort of AdWindows.dll, someone could test this
    with Acad...

    Ich würde Ihnen helfen, das gleiche in AutoCad machen, aber ich niemals angelegt

  body: 'Hi Victor,


    in the Pimp-My-Revit-Or-AutoCAD posting you can see a code snippet for an AutoCAD
    plugin.


    In fact, you need to include the correct AutoCAD.NET dlls, then complile your
    plugin dll and load it into AutoCAD using netload.

    Hope this helps you with starting.



    Best regards,

    Rudolf'

    I forwarded it to Kean, so perhaps he may adjust it to the AutoCAD environment
    and blog about it.
