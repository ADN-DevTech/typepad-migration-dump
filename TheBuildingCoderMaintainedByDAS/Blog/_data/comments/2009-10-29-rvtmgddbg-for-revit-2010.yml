  body: "Dear Danny,\n\nCome to think of it, and prompted by your question, I checked\
    \ and did actually mention it when reporting on the Revit API introduction webcast\
    \ itself:\n\n<a href=\"http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2009/05/revit-api-introduction-webcast.html\"\
    >http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2009/05/revit-api-introduction-webcast.html</a>\n\
    \nBut who is that attentive?\n\nSorry about the bad timing. \n\nBlame Rod for\
    \ asking the question so late  :-)  Or me for taking so long to answer his query\
    \  :-)\n\nI am glad you will be able to cram in a mention of it after all.\n\n\
    Looking forward to seeing you at AU!\n\nCheers, Jeremy."

  body: 'Dear Luke,


    Thank you for a great question, and I have a great answer for you as well.


    RvtMgdDbg has been renamed to RevitLookup, which was deemed easier to pronounce,
    and is included in the Revit 2011 SDK.


    Isn''t that great news?


    Cheers, Jeremy.
