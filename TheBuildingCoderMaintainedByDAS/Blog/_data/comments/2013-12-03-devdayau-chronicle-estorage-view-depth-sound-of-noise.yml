  body: 'Hi Jeremy, thanks for posting my code on your blog :)

    I was wondering if you colud change the words "Codice Sorgente" in hte title and
    the decription into my name "Paolo Emilio Serra" or my blog "Punto Revit" because
    they just mean "source code" as you would know ;)


    grazie mille

    this. As said, it looks interesting. and I am hoping this will help more people
    discover it. I added the changes you suggest, of course. Thank you!

  body: 'Hi Jeremy,


    I''m really new to Revit API and I really appreciate if someone like you is interested
    in my code, I''ve many ideas but most of the time I don''t know how to obtain
    what I want :)

    I need all the help I can get, at least I won''t be ungrateful :)


    Cheers

  body: 'real cool stuff Paolo! i''ve added your blog as my "must read all" list,
    and thanks Jeremy for finding that treasure!

    well, seems i don''t have to learn Italy at all even though google online translation
    is a bit weird, for instance, your recent post of "Auto Floor Maker" is "汽车地板制造商"
    in chinese which means "Automobile Floor Manufacturer"

    Cheers,

    Ning'

  body: 'Hi Ning,


    I''m glad you like what I''ve done, I don''t think it''s a treasure, to me it''s
    more like a dialog of what I try to accomplish using Revit and more recently using
    the API.

    I''m sorry for the wierd translation, but as you can imagine, I don''t have control
    over it, please let me know in the comments if the translation it''s completely
    useless, I''ll provide one by myself.


    Cheers

  body: 'hi Paolo and Jeremy,


    i''m trying to understand that 3DView Depth Override stuff, by using my own simplified
    code, works OK for plan / section / elevation views, but i have trouble to understand
    the coordinate system in terms of relationship between 3DView''s Cropbox and Outline
    used in BoundingBoxIntersectsFilter, i assume the followings:

    1) Boundingbox of 3DView''s Cropbox is in coordinate system on top of the computer
    screen in which Z is perpendicular to the computer screen

    2) Outline used in BoundingBoxIntersectsFilter is in Revit coordinate system


    a bit description in your blog will be great, perhaps Jeremy can give a more technical
    detailed explanation in the future.


    anyway, Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!
