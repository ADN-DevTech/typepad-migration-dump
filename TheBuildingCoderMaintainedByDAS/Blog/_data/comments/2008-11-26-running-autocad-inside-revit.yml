    I have sent off a query to my colleagues to find out, but no answer yet. I do

  body: 'Hi Jeremy!

    I develope tools to autocad 2010 and liked a lot of  topic: "embedding AutoCAD
    2009 in a standalone dialog".  It''s working very good in vb6 language, but I
    got some problem related to release basic functions by textEdit simulating a cad''s
    prompt. Some callbacks are slowing work on graphic screen. Do I need compilate
    a vb6 like class and creatind a dll file ?


    Thanks!'
