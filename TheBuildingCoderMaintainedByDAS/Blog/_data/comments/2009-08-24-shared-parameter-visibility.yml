  body: Hi. I need to ask you. I think it´s not possible, but you are an expert with
    API and tell me if we can change the information of that SCALE LABEL, shown on
    titleblocks ? When we have two different scales on sheet, the value is AS INDICATED.
    But if I want to change to other thing ? If I need to translate to FRENCH or ITALIAN
    ?

  body: "Dear Ricardo,\n\nOne easy way to check this is to use the built-in parameters\

    \nI created a new sheet, selected the title block, and launched the built-in parameters\
    \ checker. One of the parameters that it displays is the built-in parameter SHEET_SCALE\
    \ with the display name 'Scale'. It is a string-valued parameter and is unfortunately\
    \ marked as read-only.\n\nIs that the one you are interested in? If so, then,\
    \ as you can see, you seem to be out of luck. Being marked as read-only, it cannot\
    \ be modified directly through the API. I'll ask around and see whether I can\
    \ find any other way to modify this information. \n\nCheers, Jeremy."

  body: 'Dear Ricardo,


    A colleague of mine, Phil Xia, has the following suggestion for you: How about
    modifying the title block of the sheet? It is a family, the texts can be modified
    or localized. Simply open the family file for editing and modify that.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: 'Hello Jeremy,


    I''m new to this whole API thing and quite honestly, not quite sure I get it all
    so i''ll be reading on that on the weeks to come. However, I was wondering if
    it is feasable to refer a family parameter (while building the family in REVIT)
    to a built-in parameter (such as SHEET_SCALE). For example, I could have a yes/no
    parameter showing either the label refering to the built-in parameter or the family
    parameter depending id SHEET_SCALE is showing "As indicated".


    It might seem far fetch, but again I''m just getting started with the formulas,
    never mind the API.


    Thank you,'

    I should think that that is possible. Please have a look at the method AssociateElementParameterToFamilyParameter
    and the samples provided with the family API webcast:

    I come to know that shared parameters can be invisible(tried some code), but till
    they are shown in Revit ''Family Types'' window.

    I m not able to understand this concept.


    Please help.

    Thanks & regards

    Can you achieve what you need manually through the user interface? If not, it
    is probably not possible through the API either.
