  body: "Hi, Jeremy.\n\nI wrote some helpers methods for myself which help me create\
    \ my own buttons with fluent.\n\nFor example, to create two buttons I write next\
    \ code\nRibbon ribbon = new Ribbon(a);\n            ribbon\n                .Tab(CommonRes.IVC)\n\
    \                .Panel(CommonRes.IVCCatalogs)\n                .CreateButton(\"\
    button1\",\n                              Resources.Button1,\n               \
    \               \"IVC.Command\")\n                .SetLargeImage(Resources.ImageLarge)\n\
    \                .SetSmallImage(Resources.ImageSmall)\n(Resources.SyncMaterialsDescription)\n\
    \                .Finish()\n                .CreateButton(\"button2\",\n     \
    \                         \"Button2\",\n                              \"FullCommandClassName\"\
    )\n                .SetLargeImage(Resources.Image1)\n                .SetSmallImage(Resources.Image2)\n\
    \                .SetLongDescription(\"Button2 description\")\n              \
    \  .Finish();\n\nIt is nore simple than write a lot of code to create PushButtonData\
    \ etc.\n\nIf you interested this, I can send you the source code, or compiled\
    \ assembly.\n\nRegards,\nVictor."

  body: 'Dear Victor,


    I absolutely agree that this is simpler than using the Revit API out of the box.


    I think this might make a very nice blog post, if you are willing to share the
    code.


    I just have to find time to study all of your numerous contributions and catch
    up with the speed at which you are making them  :-)


    Thank you!


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    for your blog :-) I''ll write a draft about  button creating little bit later.
    Let''s have a break ;)


    Have a nice day,
