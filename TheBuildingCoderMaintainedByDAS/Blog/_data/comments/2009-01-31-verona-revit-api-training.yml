  body: 'Hi Jeremy,


    This is exactly what we have been talking at the REVIT API Trainning @ Barcelona.
    This example is a great help.


    Have you been able to use the Cut Structure by Plane option as well?


    Thanks.


    Cheers, RJ.'

    Wow, glad it helped. If this example is useful to you, I am sorry we did not dive
    into that topic a bit deeper in Barcelona as well, and glad it came up again.


    Oh, I just noticed another bit of information about the coping offset distance
    in the RevitAPI.chm help file: This beam will be cut to fit another element, the
    cutter. The cut will include an offset determined by the parameter STRUCTURAL_COPING_DISTANCE.
    The parameter affects all copings on this element. This function corresponds to
    Tools > Coping in Revit Structure.


    If I search the help file for the term ''coping'', it shows the AddCoping method.
    If I search for ''cut plane'', nothing relevant shows up, so I would assume this
    is not available through the API.


    Please submit a wish list item through ADN if this functionality is important
    for you.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: Hi Jeremy, Your guides are very useful and have provided much light in fog!
    I have a question relating to Element Sets, I’ve got Revit to tell me what is
    within a manually selected range of objects, is it possible to create the element
    set based on a room object boundary? Regards, Eddie M.

    I am glad this is useful, and thank you for your appreciation!


    Yes, sure. One easy way to select object within a given geometrical region is
    to make use of the filtered element collector and specify a BoundingBoxIntersectsFilter
    or BoundingBoxIsInsideFilter. If the room has an odd shape, you may need to apply
    some post-processing to fix boundary cases. Or approximate the room volume by
    a combination of several bounding boxes.


    Cheers, Jeremy.
