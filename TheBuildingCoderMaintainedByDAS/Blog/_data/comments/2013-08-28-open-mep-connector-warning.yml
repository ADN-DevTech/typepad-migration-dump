  body: 'Dear Gahlot,


    Thank you for your query.


    Funnily enough, another developer requested something similar just the other day.


    I have not yet discovered whether or how it can currently be done.


    I submitted a wish list item CF-1734 [API wish: programmatically create mastersurface
    connector -- 09914247] with the development team in order to find out.


    Cheers, Jeremy.
