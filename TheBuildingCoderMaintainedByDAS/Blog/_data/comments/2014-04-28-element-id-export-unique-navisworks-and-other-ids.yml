    The development team has open issues REVIT-27373 and REVIT-23974 on programmatic
    creation of radial dimensioning and is working on those. No guarantees, though,
    so don''t hold your breath.


    They also have an open wish list item CF-191 for the programmatic creation of
    ceilings.


    For the latter, I would suggest you try to use floors or slabs of some kind as
    described in detail here:

    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    for the radial dimension I think I''m just going to find the center point & mid
    point of the arc and draw a linear dimension.


    thanks again'

    Thank you for your appreciation.


    Your idea sounds fine! Good luck with that.


    Please let us know how it goes.


    A generic implementation might be of interest to others as well.


    Cheers, Jeremy.
