  body: 'Hi Jeremy,


    some other view stuff:


    When using UIDocument.ShowElement(...), Revit will search for a "good" view.


    Imagine you want to show a chair in inside a building, residing on level 1.

    There may be an opened viewplan, but it is showing level 0, not 1.


    When invoking UIDoc.ShowElement(chair), Revit knows that there is no vaild view
    opened for this chair.

    If there is also the {3D} view opened, Revit may switch to that view because our
    chair may be visible in that view.


    Depending on the view angle, there may be some walls that hide the chair in the
    3D view, so Revit''s chosen view isn''t a "good" view at all.


    Is there a way to avoid Revit to open such a *false* view ?


    Cheers,

    Rudi'

    to simply Zoom Fit a view, and I am not sure this will help. Am I missing something
    obvious? Regards, Dale

  body: 'Dear Dale,


    Thank you for your appreciation, and I am glad you find it useful.


    If you know the extents of the zoom fit this should suit your bill.


    I would assume that the standard Revit zoom fit functionality just zooms to a
    region including all the element bounding boxes, and you can determine those yourself
    as well.


    So it should work as far as I can tell.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: 'Hi Jeremy,

    thanks for this great post.

    We are currently developing a gesture control app with kinect and were thinking
    about orbiting and panning.

    But in 3D-View it is kind of difficult to manage these operations by modifing
    the Coords.

    Do you have a good hint for a solution for us?


    Cheers,

    Alex'

    Thank you for your appreciation. Glad you like it.


    Great, your project sounds obercool.


    No, I''m afraid I do not have any particularly good hints for you. I would have
    to do the same research as you. The view manipulation is a bit fiddly.


    The best I can provide is all published:

    I am very interested in hearing what you find out and how you solve this!


    Cheers, Jeremy.'
