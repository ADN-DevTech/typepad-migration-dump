  body: "Hi Jeremy,\nI just ran into your blog and found lots of inspiring materials\

    \ extract the cost of all wood materials in the model into a predefined pdf form,\
    \ what is the best way to handle it? I understand through quantities/schedules,\
    \ we can export such information to excel,or as xml, but what if I don't want\
    \ to go through the \"export\" part, but instead I would like to create a plug-in,\
    \ such as a menu that hosts couple of pdf forms that require the input of material\
    \ cost in a certain format?\nI hope I have made my question clear enough, and\
    \ will really appreciate if you could shed some light on it.\nThanks in advance!\n\

  body: 'Dear Wei,


    Great, I am very glad you like it. Nope, I do not understand you question, because
    I do not know exactly what you mean by "Integration of PDF documents in Revit"
    and "a menu that hosts couple of pdf forms". You can definitely create a plug-in
    that traverses the BIM and extracts quantities. What you do with the data you
    accumulated, such as formatting it into PDF, is entirely up to you.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: 'Hi Jeremy,

    I really appreciate your prompt reply. I knew that my question was a little confusing:)


    OK, let me try it again. I created a model, and it had some wood materials that
    cost $50000. And I tagged part of them as FSC certified wood, say $10000. Then
    I made a material take-off that summarized these wood materials and sorted it
    into two groups: FSC certified and Non-FSC certified. My question comes at the
    next step: I need to fill in a pdf submittal form with the same information I
    already have in the material take-off, which is repetitive and inefficient. So
    any chance that I can skip this step by generating the material take-off "directly"
    using my own pdf form if the pdf form is already embedded in Revit(That''s what
    I mean integrate pdf with Revit)? If yes, which part of Revit API covers information
    like this? Do I need the pdf API (if it exists!) as well?


    I assume this "data extraction" is different from "save" or "export" the "material
    take-off" as pdf format since the pdf form I am using is a submittal form created
    by Adobe LifeCycle Designer ES.


    Does this question make any sense? Or should I simply give up this idea?


    Thanks!

  body: 'Dear Wei,


    Your question is probably not confusing at all, for someone who knows the workflow
    and user interface better than I do, and the detailed explanation makes perfect
    sense to me.


    There are libraries available for generating PDF files directly, but they obviously
    have nothing to do with the Revit API.


    As far as I can tell, from an API point of view, your question is basically whether
    you have access to the material take-off data you need.


    If you do have access to the required data, then you could create your own PDF
    file from it. This process would be completely separate from the current one,
    and entirely your own responsibility.


    Whether you can access this data I do not know. I suggest you explore a suitable
    sample model using RvtMgdDbg and the other tools discussed in posts on exploring
    the Revit database and element parameters to find out.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

  body: 'Hi Jeremy,

    You are absolutely right. The ability to manipulate these data is key to my question.
    I''ve started looking into RvtMgdDbg, and hopefully could get something out of
    it.

    Thanks for all your advice so far!

    Good luck getting at the data you need, and I look forward to hearing what progress
    you can make on accessing everything required to generate the PDF.


    Cheers, Jeremy.
