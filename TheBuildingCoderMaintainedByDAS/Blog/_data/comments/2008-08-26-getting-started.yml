  body: 'Dear Zachary,


    I''m sorry to say I do not have Visual Studio Express installed to try this out
    for you. You just need to compile a normal class library. It should be pretty
    obvious. You might want to google for something like ''visual studio express 2008
    vb tutorial''. That turn up lots of useful looking hits for me.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    I am looking to develop my first application to take the symbol from a nested
    family(lightswitch) within a family(generic adaptive family) into the project
    space. I don''t think that this is possible in revit itself.


    Could you tell me is it possible before I continue?




    Thank you very much for this blog. It is great!

    Wow, congratulations on getting started with your first Revit add-in.


    Yes, this is possible.


    You will probably need to use the EditFamily, LoadFamilySymbol and NewFamilyInstance
    methods:
