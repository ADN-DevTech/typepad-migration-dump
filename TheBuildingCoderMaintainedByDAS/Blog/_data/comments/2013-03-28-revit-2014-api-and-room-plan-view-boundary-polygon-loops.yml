  body: 'Hi Jeremy,


    You mentioned "linked element selection" and I found in the 2014 SDK, "PickObject()
    and PickObjects() now allow selection of elements in RVT Links."


    However, can we get currently selected elements in linked models like we can from
    ActiveUIDocument.Selection.Elements? (Without prompting the user?)


    I''m finding that ActiveUIDocument.Selection.Elements does not include selected
    elements in linked models. Maybe there''s a work-around?


    All the best,

    Adam'

  body: 'Dear Adam,


    That is a very valid question.


    ActiveUIDocument.Selection.Elements cannnot return elements in any other document,
    simply because it would be returning duplicate elelement ids from multiple different
    documents, which would lead to great confusion.


    In theory, there could be a way: UIDocument(linked_document).Selection.Elements
    could work, eventually; I do not think it does right now, though.


    I don''t even think we instantiating a UIDocument off a linked document is currently
    allowed...


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    Here is another idea regarding the selection of elements in a linked file:
