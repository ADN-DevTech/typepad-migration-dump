    Once again, nice post.

    Concerning Repeating Last Command, I can put a result of my research (thx to you).
    This is a video where you can see that I can repeat the last command (for the
    moment, only commands wich are in KeyBoardShortCuts. I use F4 to repeat last one.

    Works on RAC2009..not yet in 2010

    Thanks for the appreciation, glad you like it!


    Thank you also very much for the info on using the F4 key to repeat the last command.


    I looked at your video, it looks impressively efficient.


    I am really looking forward to a solution to send keystrokes or shortcut keys
    to Revit 2010.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    For helping you, you must know that I had problem with sending KeyStrokes to Revit
    Handle Application. I used "PostMessage" in USER32.DLL.


    Have a nice Day.

    By the way, does the journals directory is the same with Revit2010. Cause, someone

  body: 'Dear Mira,


    Basically, this is a very valid question which we have encountered a couple of
    times already in the past.


    No, I am sorry to say that I do not know of any way to access the documents collection
    from the ControlledApplication instance, nor can you cast it to an Application
    instance.


    Still, I do not quite see why this should be an issue for you?


    In the OnStartup method, you can simply register to the DocumentOpened event.
    When the document is opened, this event is triggered and provides your application
    with a DocumentOpenedEventArgs instance, which provides the document that you
    need, doesn''t it?


    OnStartup is called at a point in time where no documents are yet open, so there
    are no links to analyse or document to update at that point.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'

    Nice blog. Congratulation.

    I''m really new in this field. Is it possible to develop application without start
    up Revit?

    The idea is user just need to key in the name and location of the revit file and
    the application will read the file to extract the information from revit file
    and insert into database.


    Thanks a lot.

    Sorry, no, the Revit API is only accessible within a running Revit application,
    and only within the context of certain call-back methods:

    I read Revit 2011 Developer Guide and trying develop a sample code. Instead of
    using DocumentOpened I changed to DocumentSavedAs. It crash when I close Revit
    Software.

    Is it any other way to debug why it crash(maybe using messagebox or try-catch)?

  body: 'Dear Abidah,


    I use the Visual Studio debugger and set a breakpoint immediately before the problematic
    code, just as described in section 2.2.6 Debug the Add-in in the developer guide
    "Revit 2011 API Developer Guide.pdf". That always shows me exactly what is going
    on and is much more efficient than instrumenting the code with message boxes and
    stuff. Adding a top-level try-catch handler can also help, of course, but as soon
    as the exception has been thrown it takes you away from the problematic code location
    to the exception handler.


    Cheers, Jeremy.'
