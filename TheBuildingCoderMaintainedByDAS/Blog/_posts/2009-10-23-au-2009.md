<p>These days I am pretty occupied with the preparation of my sessions for 

<a href="http://au.autodesk.com">
Autodesk University 2009</a>:</p>

<ul>

<li>
<a href="http://au.autodesk.com/?nd=e_class&session_id=5269">
<strong>CP308-2</strong> All Systems Go in the New Autodesk Revit MEP API</a></li>

<li>
<a href="https://au.autodesk.com/?nd=e_class&session_id=5265&jid=323682">
<strong>CP9118-1</strong> The New Autodesk Revit Family API: Everything is Relative</a></li>

</ul>

<p>The Family API one is a virtual class which requires special preparation, since it is being recorded and broadcast 

worldwide for 

<a href="http://au.autodesk.com/?nd=virtual_home&pre=1">
Virtual Autodesk University</a>.

As 

<a href="http://www.civil3d.com/2009/10/autodesk-university-virtual">
Rick Graham</a> pointed out, 

virtual AU was created for those who are not able to make it to Las Vegas in person, and is free for subscription 

customers.</p>

<p>Here are links to the 

<a href="http://au.autodesk.com/?

nd=e_class_listing&filter_date=&filter_time=&filter_room=&filter_type=&filter_track=&filter_software=&filter_speaker=1148

24">
standard class catalogue</a> and the 

<a href="https://au.autodesk.com/?nd=virtual_class_listing&speaker_filter=114824#classlisting">
virtual classes</a>.

<p>I would love to see you in person in the classroom session,
or chat with you live during one of the virtual ones.
