<p>Quite a while back, I published a 

<a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2009/08/unit-conversion.html">
unit conversion utility</a> for Revit 2010.

Let's take a fresh look at that, and also at a 

<a href="#2">couple of new Revit blogs</a>.

<p>We discussed a couple of other issues related to units since then, such as the

267_filter_units.htm
382_voltage_units.htm
-->

<a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2009/10/unit-suffix-and-the-projectunit-sdk-sample.html">
unit suffix and ProjectUnit SDK sample</a> and a look at 

<a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2010/06/voltage-units.html">
voltage units</a>.

The latter also includes an overview of some other unit related posts.

<p>Anyway, <a href="http://www.rodhowarth.com/">Rod Howarth</a> picked up on the unit converter utility and ported it to Revit 2011.
He says:

<p>I was reading your old post on a reader-contributed 

<a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2009/08/unit-conversion.html">
Unit Conversion</a> Revit 

utility today, and I couldn't find an updated version (and I don't think it made it into the full SDK from what I could tell). 
So I decided to quickly convert it to Revit 2011, and send it through to you.

<p>It's a handy utility, especially for us Aussies with our metric system. 
I've just gone through and done the basic conversions that are required for the new namespaces, and made a manifest file for it. 
It seemed to run fine for me though I am fairly busy so haven't done extensive testing. 
Here is 

<span class="asset  asset-generic at-xid-6a00e553e1689788330147e204a3c6970b"><a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/files/unitconversion2011.zip">UnitConversion2011.zip</a></span>

containing the complete source code and Visual Studio solution and including the binary executable files in the bin subfolder. 

<p>This is what it looks like running in Revit MEP 2011 and gives you an idea of the functionality provided:

</center>

<p>Many thanks to Rod for converting and sharing this useful utility!

<p>And yes, it didn't seem to make it into the SDK after all, did it?

<h4>New Revit API Blog</h4>

<p>Stephen Germano, Project Director, and his colleagues at the 

<a href="http://www.bimadvent.com">
ibd Resource Group</a>,

have started up a new Revit API blog and say that they hope for a couple blog posts a week; check it out at

<ul>
<li><a href="http://ibdrg.typepad.com/ibd-resource-group">ibdrg.typepad.com/ibd-resource-group</a> or

<h4>New Polish Revit Blog</h4>

<p>Andrzej Samsonowicz, Application Engineer in the Warsaw office of Autodesk, has successfully launched a new blog about Autodesk Revit in Polish:

<ul>
<li><a href="http://revit-pl.typepad.com/my-blog">revit-pl.typepad.com/my-blog</a>.
</ul>

<p>The new blog promotes BIM, provides tips and tricks, suggests best practices and workflows, answers common problems faced by Revit users, and presents the latest technologies for AEC users. 
 
<p>It is part of an effort from Autodesk in Poland and the International Community team to:

<ul>
<li>Further develop the <a href="http://communities.autodesk.com/poland">user community in Polish language</a>.
<li>Support the connection of employees with customers in their particular market. 
<li>Promote the creation of relevant content in Poland. 
</ul>

<p>I would encourage you to take a look, read, subscribe, and engage if you are a Polish speaker (or use Google Translate :-). 

<p>Actually, you can get an

I am pleasantly surprised how readable this machine translation is.
