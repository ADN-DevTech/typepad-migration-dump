<p>I recently presented an explanation of some Revit

<a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2013/02/content-localisation.html#3">
MEP family editor part type classes</a>,

which led to a follow-up:

<p><strong>Question:</strong> Thank you for the detailed answer about the duct fittings.
I have a similar problem with one of the pipe fittings, namely spud. I know what a spud is, but not the difference between an adjustable and a perpendicular one.</p>

<p>Can you explain the actual difference, please?</p>

<p>Here is an image with some different spuds that I collected:</p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Spuds are analogous to taps in ductwork, which also have adjustable and perpendicular part types.

<p>Their difference is probably best described by example.
Here are two smaller branches, both routed from the larger main at 45 degrees:</p>

<p>The adjustable tap on the left adjusted to accommodate the 45-degree route.

<p>The perpendicular tap on the right is constrained to tap perpendicularly off the main.
Then, an elbow is automatically inserted after a short duct length to route the branch to the picked point.

<p>Many thanks to Martin Schmid for this explanation.</p>
