<p>Are you interested in reading or writing DWG files directly, without installing AutoCAD?</p>

<p>Querying? Viewing? Editing?</p>

<p>Would you like to expand your solutions to support mobile devices and the web?</p>

<p>Would you like to avoid implementing different or new application code to support desktop, mobile and web apps?</p>

<p>Hear about the most efficient, reliable and robust solutions at the upcoming
<a href="http://www.meetup.com/I-Love-DWG-Prague/events/225070857">'I Love DWG' meetup</a> in Prague next Tuesday evening, September 8.</p>

<p>Maybe you are already familiar with the Autodesk <a href="http://www.autodesk.com/realdwg">RealDWG</a> library for reading and writing DWG files.</p>

<p>Are you also aware of the new <a href="https://developer.autodesk.com/api/autocadio">AutoCAD I/O</a> web service?</p>

<p>It provides access to <strong>AutoCAD on the Cloud</strong> with much of the power and capability of a full desktop AutoCAD installation, tuned for web development.</p>

<p>Do you know about the <a href="http://developer-autodesk.github.io">Autodesk View &amp; Data web service</a> that can help you deliver a customised viewing experience on any device in just a few hours of development time?</p>

<p>The View &amp; Data web service provides a broad and deep API and supports over 60 3D and 40 2D file formats, most of them non-Autodesk.</p>

<p>RealDWG, AutoCAD I/O and the translation engine driving the Autodesk View &amp; Data web service are all created from the same codebase, too.</p>

<p><a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/autocad/adam-nagy.html">Adam Nagy</a> and
<a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/about-the-author.html">Kean Walmsley</a>
will be demonstrating a number of sample applications based on the AutoCAD I/O and View &amp; Data web services.</p>

<p>You’ll get to see how sites such as Kean's
<a href="http://jigsawify.com">http://jigsawify.com</a> &ndash; based on AutoCAD I/O &ndash; and
<a href="http://vrok.it/">http://vrok.it</a> &ndash; using the View &amp; Data API &ndash; are implemented.</p>

<p>Would you like to learn more?</p>
