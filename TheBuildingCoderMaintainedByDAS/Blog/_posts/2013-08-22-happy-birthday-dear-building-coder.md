<p>Thank you, Christopher!
I love you.</p>

<p>A better reason still is that we hear how important this resource is for you guys.
Here are a few selected samples of the wealth of appreciation I receive, and a pointer to a new Autodesk BIM product, while we are at it:</p>

<p>Here are some comments we received on it:</p>

<ul>
<li>Best knowledge and samples came from The Building Coder.</li>
<li>The Building Coder is the best Revit API resource by a long shot.</li>
<li>On a side note The Building Coder blog is by far the best resource you guys provide.</li>
</ul>

<p>Thank you ever so much for your interest, support and appreciation!</p>

<p>Above all, thank you for all the perseverance, energy and enthusiasm you invest in making use of the Revit API!</p>

<h4>More Appreciation for The Building Coder</h4>

<ul>

<li>Let me start off by saying thanks for The Building Coder blog, it has been very helpful on numerous occasions while programming with the Revit API!</li>

<li>Thanks for the help. You are a scholar and gentleman.</li>

<li>I'm glad to read your replies and your blog, it is a treasure and the first informational source for solving most of problems, thanks for your reply and additional links, I've just read it and improved some of my code :-)</li>

<li>Keep up the good work. There is still a real shortage of practical Revit API information so your blog is important.</li>

<li>Been catching up on more fine posts from you.</li>

<li>I have enjoyed your recent posts on the BuildingCoder web site as you have hit on some of the topics that I'm covering in my RTC Lab next week.</li>

<li>I am following strictly Buildingcoder.typepad.com to take my Revit Skills to the next level with programming.
I also like all the trips you make to most fantastic places in the world.
To be honest I follow you as my role model, you have been blessed with all good skills...</li>

<li>Thank you so much for your prompt reply.
I found a good solution from one of the links embedded in the posts you pointed me to.
That was great.</li>

<li>I'm retiring from my job.
This is the last month when I work here.
But I'm not leaving Revit.
What will I do next?
Well... Due to your awesome blog and sharing my articles about Revit API I've found a new job.
Rather job has found me :-)
Many thanks to you that you gave me opportunity to get an interesting job.</li>

<li>A new commercial product: "A recent meander through the TheBuildingCoder website led me to a routine for marking the corners of structural concrete corners."</li>

<li>Wir freuen uns schon auf die vielen neuen Möglichkeiten, die uns Revit bald bieten wird :-)
Ich möchte mich nochmal ganz herzlich bei Dir bedanken für Deine Hilfe und Unterstützung heute und über das Jahr mit Deinem Blog und ADN; schön, Dich jetzt kennengelernt zu haben.</li>

<li>I will be transitioning to a new development job and will not be regularly using Revit API anymore.
I wanted to send a quick thank you note for the excellent job you have been doing with the blog.
The blog has a wealth of resources regarding the API.
What I appreciate the most is your style of posting insightful questions and answers from other users.
The obvious side effect to this being, answers to many questions are a quick Google search away.
Most of the time, when I was stuck on something with the API, a search on the blog either provided me the answer or at the least gave ideas on how to approach the problem.
Please keep up the good work.</li>

</ul>

this nice graphical comment on the growing number of The Building Coder viewers:</p>

<p>Thank you, Vladimir! &nbsp; :-)</p>



<p>I am really touched.</p>

<p>So, after discreetly wiping our eyes, we all turn back relieved to the rat wheel of the technical and commercial aspects of life and business.</p>

<h4>Autodesk Point Layout Product</h4>

<p>Autodesk is announcing a new construction product,
