<p>I'll be attending the
two <a href="http://au.autodesk.com">Autodesk University conferences</a> in
Darmstadt, Germany, October 17-18, and Las Vegas, USA, November 14-16.</p>

<p>Both of these are preceded by a <a href="https://forge.autodesk.com/devcon-2017">Forge DevCon developer conference</a>.</p>

<p>You may be interested only in Revit and its API or other desktop oriented programming and asking yourself why you should care about Forge and all that cloud stuff.</p>

<p>If so, you might want to expand your horizon and take a look at Stephen Preston's analysis and explanation in his article
on <a href="https://forge.autodesk.com/blog/developing-autodesk-desktop-software-heres-why-you-should-care-about-forge-devcon-and-autodesk">developing for Autodesk desktop software? Here’s why you should care about Forge DevCon (and Autodesk University)</a>.</p>

<p>He addresses the following topics in detail:</p>

<ul>
<li>What’s this Forge thing, again?</li>
<li>Ok, but why will coming to Forge DevCon help me?</li>
<li>I’m an AutoCAD developer. How will it help me?</li>
<li>What about Revit developers?</li>
<li>Inventor? Fusion?</li>
<li>And what about Autodesk University?</li>
<li>You had me at ‘DevLab’. Where do I sign up?</li>
<li>I don’t live in the US, and I don’t plan to visit. Where else can I learn about Forge?</li>
</ul>

<p>If that gets you hooked, here is the next place to visit:</p>
