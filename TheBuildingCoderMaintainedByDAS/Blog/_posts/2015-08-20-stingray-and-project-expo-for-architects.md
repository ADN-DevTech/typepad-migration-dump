<p>Project Expo provides the ability to explore your design and communicate design intent in a compelling real-time environment, supporting architects and other designers in sharing and experiencing architectural designs with clients, going way beyond drawings and videos.</p>

<p>This significantly helps tell your story and convey your message to your stakeholders.</p>

<p>Project Expo leverages Autodesk’s powerful new game engine, Stingray, and puts it to use for professionals in Architecture, Engineering, and Construction. It is based on a cloud service, making the conversion from BIM to real-time automatic and simple as the click of a button.</p>

<p>Join Project Expo and try it for yourself at <a href="https://projectexpo.autodesk.com">projectexpo.autodesk.com</a>.</p>

<p>We would love to hear from you if you want to integrate immersive visualisation into your design process to find out how we can further improve this technology.</p>

<p>You can reach us at <a href="mailto:labs.expo@autodesk.com">labs.expo@autodesk.com</a> or in the discussion forums associated with the project.</p>

<p>Architectural immersion is alive in the lab.</p>
