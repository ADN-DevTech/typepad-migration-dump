<p>I am back from
my <a href="https://www.flickr.com/gp/jeremytammik/6D2J6x">vacation in Andalusia</a>:</p>

</center></p>

<p>Time to get through the email backlog and back to productive work again.</p>

<p>No, not at all, time to get ready for
the Revit Technology Conference <a href="http://www.rtcevents.com/rtc2015eu">RTC Europe</a> in
Budapest next week, all-too-quickly followed
by <a href="http://au.autodesk.com">Autodesk University</a> and
the <a href="http://autodeskdevdays.com">Autodesk DevDays 2015</a>.</p>

<p>Oh dear, in a hurry again.</p>

<p>Time flies!</p>

<p>The DevDays format is significantly changed from previous years:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#2">Autodesk DevDays 2015 with Accelerators</a></li>
<li><a href="#3">Kean's hsbcad Wood Construction Customer Visit</a></li>
<li><a href="#4">CAD Trends</a></li>
</ul>

<h4><a name="2"></a>Autodesk DevDays 2015 with Accelerators</h4>

<p>This year we are discussing the annual Autodesk developer conferences more publicly than ever before.</p>

<p>Besides informing existing developers about the existing desktop products, we are encouraging new, innovative developers to engage with Autodesk cloud technologies as well.</p>

<p>Thanks largely to the positive experience of
running <a href="http://autodeskcloudaccelerator.com">Cloud Accelerators</a> in different locations &ndash;
e.g., <a href="http://the3dwebcoder.typepad.com/blog/2015/04/webgl-viewer-cloud-accelerator-verold-and-rtc.html#2">San Francisco</a>,
<a href="http://the3dwebcoder.typepad.com/blog/2015/09/towards-a-comphound-mongo-database-table-view.html">Prague</a> &ndash;
the ADN team has shifted their thinking for this year's tour: rather than visiting 15+ cities around the world, the team has reduced the number of locations and increased the amount of time spent in each.
3-4 day Accelerators will be held in a number of cities adjacent to the more traditional DevDay events.</p>

<p>This gives you as a developer a great opportunity to really kick-start your cloud-centric development efforts, gain a deeper understanding of Autodesk's
fast-evolving <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_as_a_service">PaaS</a> offerings
and even create something tangible before heading back home from the event.</p>

<p>It is really rewarding to create something brand new away from your everyday typical routine and head back with a working prototype ready for further development.</p>

<p>The DevDay events will continue to cover the new features and APIs in the desktop products, of course, and the Accelerators will have help on-hand for working with those APIs as well as their newer, cloud-centric siblings.</p>

<p></center></p>

<p>I strongly recommend signing up for one of these events.</p>

<p>While they are intended for ADN members, you should certainly reach out to your local ADN representative via
the <a href="http://autodeskdevdays.com/register">registration page</a> if you're interested in attending without being a network member. I will be at the DevDay and DevHack at AU in Las Vegas as well as the DevDay and Accelerator in Munich.</p>

<h4><a name="3"></a>Kean's hsbcad Wood Construction Customer Visit</h4>

<p>I worked a lot in the past
with <a href="http://hsbcad.com">hsbcad</a>, an ADN member and provider
of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hsbcad">software for the offsite construction industry</a>,
including both AutoCAD and Revit-based applications.</p>

<p>Kean Walmsley now published an interesting report on his recent visit to the hsbcad
customer <a href="http://www.jpf-ducret.ch">JPF-DUCRET</a> in Orges in Switzerland,
<a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2015/10/jpf-ducret-rebuilding-cerns-globe-using-autocad-and-hsbcad.html">rebuilding CERN's Globe using AutoCAD and hsbcad</a>.</p>

<h4><a name="4"></a>CAD Trends</h4>

<p>Are you interested in the current global CAD trends?</p>

<p>Take a look at
the Business Advantage <a href="http://www.business-advantage.com/CAD-Trends.php">CAD Trends report</a>,
a 48-page slide deck covering:</p>

<ul>
<li>Background</li>
<li>Key Trends</li>
<li>CAD Usage</li>
<li>Appendices</li>
</ul>

<p>One interesting aspect is this snapshot of usage and importance of various CAD trends in 2015, plotting perceived importance of trends against current usage:</p>

<p><center></p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="display: inline;" href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/.a/6a00e553e16897883301b8d169e354970c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00e553e16897883301b8d169e354970c img-responsive" alt="CAD trends" title="CAD trends" src="/assets/image_a4aec8.jpg" /></a><br /></p>

<p></center></p>

<p>The current strong focus on 3D modelling is obvious.</p>

<p>BIM, simulation and mobile access are also already up there in the leading quadrant.</p>

<p>A number of other trends following on will become increasingly key for CAD providers and the developer community.</p>
