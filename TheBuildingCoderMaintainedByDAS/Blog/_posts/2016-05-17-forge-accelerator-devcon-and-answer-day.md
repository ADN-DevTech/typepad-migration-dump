<p>In case you wonder why I am so quiet:</p>

<p>I am busy in Barcelona at the <a href="http://forge.autodesk.com">Forge</a> <a href="http://autodeskcloudaccelerator.com">Accelerator</a> in the Autodesk office in Poble Nou:</p>

</center></p>

<p>Furthermore, I am preparing for the <a href="http://forge.autodesk.com/conference">Forge DevCon</a> in San Francisco next month.</p>

<p>As if that was not enough, on Wednesday, I am also participating in the worldwide <a href="http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/autodeskhelp/autodesk-answer-day-may-18th-2016/ba-p/6277390">Autodesk Answer day</a>, taking place from 6am to 6pm Pacific Time.</p>

<p>This one will be the biggest yet, focusing on seven products: 3ds Max, AutoCAD, Civil3D, Inventor, Maya, Revit, and Vault.</p>

<p>Here is <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2016/05/ask-me-anything-at-next-weeks-autodesk-answer-day.html">Kean's description</a> of
this event, his participation in it, and his take
on <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2016/04/stoking-the-forge.html">where Autodesk is heading and how Forge fits in to that</a>.</p>

<p>Looking forward to hearing from you!</p>
