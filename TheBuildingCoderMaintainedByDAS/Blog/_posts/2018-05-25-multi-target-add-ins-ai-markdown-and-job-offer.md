<h4><a name="2"></a>Compiling Add-Ins for Multiple Revit Versions</h4>

<p>I met <a href="http://buildingknowledge.eu/about">Sander Obdeijn</a> at several Autodesk, Forge and Revit and came to value his deep Revit experience, both in the user interface and API.</p>

<p>Happily, Sander now says, I'm also joining the blogosphere and my opening post will be about using custom MSBuild target files to easily compile add-ins for multiple Revit versions from the same codebase:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://buildingknowledge.eu/custom-msbuild-targets-for-compiling-addins-for-multiple-revit-versions">Custom MSBuild targets for compiling addins for multiple Revit versions</a></li>
</ul>

<p>That is indeed good news!</p>

<p>Welcome, Sander!</p>

<p>I asked whether his approach might also be used in Visual Studio 2015, and he replies, '.NET core should also work in Visual Studio 2015, but haven’t tested this'.</p>

<h4><a name="3"></a>Generative Design for Office Planning</h4>

<p>In <a href="https://wilsonquarterly.com">The Wilson Quarterly</a>,
Jeffrey Brown published <a href="https://wilsonquarterly.com/quarterly/living-with-artificial-intelligence/this-is-your-office-on-ai">This is your office on AI</a>.</p>

<p>It features Autodesk's new Toronto office and an interesting four-minute presentation
on <a href="https://vimeo.com/193915345">Generative Design for Architecture: Autodesk MaRS Office</a>:</p>

<h4><a name="4"></a>Handy Markdown Tutorial</h4>

<p>Just a quick note for my own reference: I discovered
this <a href="http://eherrera.net/markdowntutorial">very handy Markdown tutorial</a>.</p>

<p>I use Markdown a lot for editing text.</p>

<p>Where?</p>

<p>Well, all The Building Coder blog posts are written completely in Markdown.</p>

<p>Please refer to
the <a href="https://github.com/jeremytammik/tbc"><code>tbc</code> GitHub repository for The Building Coder blog posts markdown source</a>.</p>

<p>I also use Markdown all the time every day to write and edit messages in <a href="https://slack.com">Slack</a>.</p>
