<h4>Free Autodesk Software for All Students Everywhere</h4>

<p>Autodesk now provides free software for students, teachers, and schools around the world.</p>

<p>Inspiring creativity and a love for science, engineering, and math in young students is more important today than ever.  So I'm very happy to announce that Autodesk has opened up FREE access to its desktop software to ALL students, teachers, and schools everywhere in the world.</p>

<p>In the past, access was free in some countries, but not others.  Today there are no restrictions.  However, all too often students and teachers are unaware that they can have their own copy and use our software in their classroom for free.  The simplest way to help a student or teacher is to direct them to

<a href="http://www.autodesk.com/education/home">
students.autodesk.com</a> where

they can download as much as they want and find curriculum and learning materials.</p>
