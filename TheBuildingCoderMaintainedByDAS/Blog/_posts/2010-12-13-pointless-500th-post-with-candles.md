<p>This post is almost pointless.

<p>Actually it does have one point and one point only: to point out The Building Coder 500<sup>th</sup> post anniversary.

<p style="text-align:center; font-size:xx-large; font-weight:bold; color:orange; text-decoration:blink;">Yippiiee!</p>

<br>

<p>I would like to celebrate this with lots of candles:</p>

a celebration of light in the darkness:

<p>I had not thought about that at all, but luckily there was both a bunch of kids singing in the hotel reception when we left in the morning, just like in the little movie above, as well as a couple of people from the neighbouring bank standing in the street outside the Autodesk office when we arrived, offering coffee and a

everybody passing by.
