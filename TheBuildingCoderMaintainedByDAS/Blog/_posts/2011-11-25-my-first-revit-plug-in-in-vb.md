<p>Back in May, we published the wonderful new Revit API training tool, the self-paced 

<a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2011/05/my-first-revit-plug-in.html">
My First Revit Plug-in</a> guide,

originally based on the C# programming language.

<p>Based on popular demand, we have now added new VB.NET samples.

<p>So regardless whether you are new to this training or have already gone through it once with the C# code, now is your chance to choose the language you prefer, C# or VB.Net, at

<a href="http://www.autodesk.com/myfirstrevitplugin">www.autodesk.com/myfirstrevitplugin</a>.

<p>The explanations in the lessons are still written for C#, but now depending on your language preference you can follow along in VB.Net!</p>
