<p>Hello.</p>

<p>I am not really back yet, but my vacation is slowly drawing to a close, and I checked my email.
Here is the first result of that:</p>

<p>My colleague

<a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/aec/augusto-goncalves.html">
Augusto Gon&ccedil;alves</a> from

the ADN team in São Paulo is providing two days each of

<a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/autocad/entrenamientos-api-espanol.html">
AutoCAD.NET and Revit API training</a> in

Mexico and in Spanish on September 3-4 and 5-6, respectively.</p>

<p>Here are direct links to the

<a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/autocad/entrenamientos-api-espanol.html">
course descriptions</a> and

<a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/entrena_API">
registration page</a>.</p>

<p>Now to enjoy the last couple of hours before returning to work seriously...</p>
