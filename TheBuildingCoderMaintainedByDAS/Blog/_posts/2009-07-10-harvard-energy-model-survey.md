<p>Here is an invitation to a 

<a href="http://www.surveymonkey.com/s.aspx?sm=JagO4lMUgSWMjQM7J2EaHQ_3d_3d">
survey on the use of building energy models during design, construction and operation</a>.

It is being carried out by the Graduate School of Design at Harvard University (GSD) in collaboration with the Harvard Office for Sustainability (OFS) and addressed to building owners, architects and energy consultants to better understand:</p>

<ul>
<li>who on the design team owns and gets access to the energy model of a building,</li>
<li>what role the model currently plays during building design and construction, and</li>
<li>how the use of the model could be extended to the overall lifetime of a building.</li>
</ul>

<p>Harvard will be sharing the results of the survey, which will be published by January 2010.</p>
