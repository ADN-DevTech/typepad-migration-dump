<p>I returned from my nine-day break and am fully invigorated and happily back with the Revit API.</p>

<p>Besides handling questions from developers, I also need to deal with the upcoming yearly conference preparations.</p>

<p>On one hand, we have Autodesk University, for which

<a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2013/09/registration-open-for-autodesk-university-2013.html">
registration opened</a> and

I need to prepare

<a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2013/08/open-mep-connector-warning.html#2">
my three classes</a>.</p>

<p>As you know, AU is completely open and public, based on the released Autodesk products, and addresses both end users and developers.</p>

<p>The Autodesk Developer Network ADN, supporting professional developers, holds another yearly series of DevDays conferences that was previously kept pretty hush-hush, as it deals with unreleased products and exclusively addresses developers under non-disclosure agreement.</p>

<p>ADN support was significantly broadened with the introduction of

<a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2012/08/au-registration-and-adn-open.html#2">ADN Open</a> last

year.</p>

<p>In spite of this initiative, an ADN membership still does provide significant advantages, such as enhanced support, access to released Autodesk products, preview versions of future releases, and the ability to participate in the confidential DevDays conferences.</p>

<p>This year, therefore, we are publicising these events more openly than before, inviting you to join one of our

<a href="#2">rEvolutionary DevDays conferences</a>.</p>

<p>Before I get to that, though, let me show a few quick impressions from my vacation in Andalusia, e.g. this sunset over Motril:</p>

<p>Look at the detailed range of different beautiful mountain range silhouettes in there:</p>

<p>I finally made it to

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabo_de_Gata-N%C3%ADjar_Natural_Park">
Cabo de Gata</a>,

where I spent a night on the beach under the full moon:</p>

<a class="asset-img-link"  style="display: inline;" href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/.a/6a00e553e168978833019aff9939a0970d-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00e553e168978833019aff9939a0970d image-full" alt="Full moon rising over Cabo de Gata" title="Full moon rising over Cabo de Gata" src="/assets/image_2ae676.jpg" border="0" /></a><br />

<p>Here is the sunrise at the same place the following morning:</p>

<p>Now, as said, I have the conferences to prepare for and a number of accumulated other issues to catch up with...</p>

<p>Here is the <a href="#2">description</a> and <a href="#3">worldwide schedule</a> of the ADN DevDays Conferences:</p>

<p>The theme for Autodesk DevDays 2013 is <b>rEvolution &ndash; Where Desktop meets the Cloud</b>.
Come and learn about upcoming releases of several new web service APIs from Autodesk.
You'll see how these new web services extend the power of the desktop: delivering easy collaboration, limitless compute power and big data &ndash; and are platforms that can deliver the same to you and your customers.
It's an opportunity to learn about a range of '360 based' web service APIs delivering you cloud based platforms for a number of industries &ndash; Manufacturing, AEC, Infrastructure and more.
And, we will of course also cover what's new in the next releases of our desktop products, e.g. AutoCAD, Revit, Inventor, Civil 3D etc.</p>

<p>Note that material at Developer Days is forward-looking and highly confidential, so ADN membership is required.

<h4>Addendum &ndash; ISO 8601 Time and Date Standard</h4>

<p></p>One reader responded to this post and asked:</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> Do you have your months and days reversed in the dates?</p>

<p>They look a little funny...</p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> No, I do not.</p>

<p>The dates above are given according to the

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601">
ISO 8601 time and date standard</a> following these

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#General_principles">
general principles</a> (among others):</p>

<ul>
<li>Date and time values are ordered from the most to the least significant: year, month (or week), day, hour, minute, second, and fraction of second. The lexicographical order of the representation thus corresponds to chronological order, except for date representations involving negative years. This allows dates to be naturally sorted by, for example, file systems.</li>
<li>Each date and time value has a fixed number of digits that must be padded with leading zeros.</li>
<li>For reduced precision, any number of values may be dropped from any of the date and time representations, but in the order from the least to the most significant...</li>
</ul>

<p>This date format actually used in daily life in some countries, e.g. all Scaninavian ones, as far as I know.</p>

<p><strong>Response:</strong> Please check again.
The format you mention is YYYY-MM-DD, whereas you seem to have used YYYY-DD-MM.</p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Oops.</p>

<p>The danger of using regular expressions, and not even bothering to ever look at the result  :-)</p>

<p>Thank you very much for pointing that out!</p>

<p>Fixed.</p>
