<p>I blogged about this topic on my personal blog in English, so I just leave a link here, if you are interested in this topic, please refer to <a href="http://www.cnblogs.com/junqilian/archive/2010/06/04/1751679.html" target="_blank">this post</a>. It was written based on MapGuide Enterprise 2011, but it applies to AIMS 2012/2013 as well with minor changes.</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>
