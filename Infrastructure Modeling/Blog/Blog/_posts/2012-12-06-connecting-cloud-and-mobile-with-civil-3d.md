<p>The class at Autodesk University Las Vegas was “From Mobile and Through the Cloud to AutoCAD® Civil 3D®”. The main idea was how collect coordinate points using Mobile with GPS enabled devices running Android or iOS, then store and merge those at the Cloud to finally generate Civil 3D objects, like surfaces, alignments or parcels. The case study will use Android phone equipped GPS and camera, using Windows Azure as cloud service to generate AutoCAD Civil 3D Cogo points.</p>
