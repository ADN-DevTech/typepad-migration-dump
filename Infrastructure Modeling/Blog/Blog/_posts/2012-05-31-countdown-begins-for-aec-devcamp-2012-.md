<p>In &#39;<a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/infrastructure/2012/04/aec-devcamp-2012.html" target="_self">AEC DevCamp 2012</a>&#39; post on 27-April-2012, we shared with you about the details of AEC DevCamp 2012. Time flies by; it&#39;s not even a week&#39;s wait now. Many of our DevTech team members are flying to Boston to participate and deliver some interesting API sessions in AEC DevCamp 2012. Some of our colleagues from engineering team are also joining us. Looking forward to a great week to meet you all in Boston!</p>
