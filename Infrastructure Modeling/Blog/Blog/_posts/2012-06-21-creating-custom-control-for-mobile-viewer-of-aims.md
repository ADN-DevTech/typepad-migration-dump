<p>By <a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/infrastructure/daniel-du.html">Daniel Du</a></p>  <p>Do you browse maps on mobile devices such as iPad, iPhone or iPod Touch? Do you use the Mobile Viewer on your mobile devices to browse MapGuide maps?&#160; The Mobile Viewer was introduced in Autodesk Infrastructure Map Server 2012, enabling you to browse your map on the go.&#160; </p>  <p>I just delivered a presentation&#160; during our biannual event – DevCamp in Waltham. This class shows you how to create a simple custom control for the Mobile Viewer, helping you getting started turning the Mobile Viewer into an efficient task specific tool.
