<p>By <a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/infrastructure/daniel-du.html">Daniel Du</a></p>  <p>In AIMS 2013, a new performance report tool is introduced in Map Administrator(<a href="http://&lt;machinename/mapserver2013/mapadmin/login.php">http://&lt;machinename/mapserver2013/mapadmin/login.php</a>). This tool can be used to analyze the performance of your map server to find out the performance bottle neck. BTW, if your performance report does not work for you, <a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/infrastructure/2012/07/performance-report-getting-frozen-in-aims-2013.html" target="_blank">this post</a> may be helpful for you.</p>  <p>Before we start, here is some background knowledge, every time we view a map in AIMS, actually we see a part of the map, it is a image which size is a little bigger than your visible area in the browser. Different part of the map and different zoom level of the map will cost different time to render it. That ‘s why we need to specify an area and also the zoom level to get the performance report when running this tool.</p>  <p>This is a performance report of my test data:</p>  <p><a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/.a/6a0167607c2431970b0167686e260f970b-pi"><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="/assets/image_10b449.jpg" width="475" height="357" /></a></p>  <p>The tag “Layers” means the time spent on layer rendering, including FDO connection, feature query and layer stylization; </p>  <p>Tag “Images” means the time spent on image creation, in other words, compress imagebuffer to a bytesstream in given format (PNG, JPG); </p>  <p>Tag “Other” includes other time spent on map rendering except layers rendering, selection rendering, watermarks rendering, label rendering and image creation. For example, create a Renderer in memory, create the map’s coordinate system, etc..</p>  <p><a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/.a/6a0167607c2431970b01761662fbff970c-pi"><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="/assets/image_32a846.jpg" width="487" height="62" /></a></p>  <p>For my performance report, it seems that my rendering performance is pretty good, the “Layers” tag is only a small percentage, because I have only 4 layers to render. Detailed rendering time cost for each layer is listed below:</p>  <p><a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/.a/6a0167607c2431970b0167686e263f970b-pi"><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="/assets/image_d2837c.jpg" width="490" height="93" /></a></p>  <p>If you have many layers to rendering, you probably want to find which ones are the bottle neck, then try to tune them up accordingly. </p>  <p>Do you think this tool useful? In next post, I will introduce how to use profiling API, which makes it possible to create your own performance report tool. Stay tuned!</p>
