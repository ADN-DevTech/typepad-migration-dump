<p>In Map 3D 2012 release, we have seen the beginning of the merger of Topobase functionalities within Map 3D. In 2013, I see a big milestone achieved in that direction which influenced lots of API changes within Map and Topobase assemblies. Lots of API functions are renamed to reflect a generic name to be relevant for extended Industry Data Model support in Map 3D 2013. Some of the APIs have become obsolete, however, you would find a replaced API for the same or there is a particular reason for that API to become obsolete in Map 3D 2013.</p>
<p>AutoCAD Map 3D <strong>Wikihelp</strong> (I have shared the link below) has a complete list of the API Changes in Map 3D 2013.</p>
