<p>It’s just getting easier to send 2D and 3D design models with Autodesk technologies: just drag &amp; drop a file at <a title="https://360.autodesk.com/viewer" href="https://360.autodesk.com/viewer">https://360.autodesk.com/viewer</a> and you’re good to go! Yes, that easy! Go ahead and try it! And works for over 50 file formats, including non-Autodesk.</p>  <p><a href="https://360.autodesk.com/viewer"><img title="View and Share any design file" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline" border="0" alt="View and Share any design file" src="/assets/image_6f89f9.jpg" width="483" height="311" /></a></p>
