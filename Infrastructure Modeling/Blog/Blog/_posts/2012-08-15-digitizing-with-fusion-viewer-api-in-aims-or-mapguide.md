<p>By <a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/infrastructure/daniel-du.html">Daniel Du</a></p>
<p>I have published a blog about digitizing with Fusion Viewer API of MapGuide on <a href="http://www.cnblogs.com/junqilian/" target="_blank">my Chinese personal blog</a>, but this post is in English. So I will just leave a link here, if you are interested in this topic, please refer to <a href="http://www.cnblogs.com/junqilian/archive/2010/06/04/1751563.html" target="_blank">this post</a>.</p>
<p>It is based on MapGuide Enterprise 2011, but it still applies to AIMS 2012/2013 with minor changes.</p>
<p>hope this helps.</p>
