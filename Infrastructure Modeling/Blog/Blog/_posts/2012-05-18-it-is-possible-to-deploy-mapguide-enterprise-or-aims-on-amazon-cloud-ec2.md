<p>Unfortunately at this stage, MapGuide Enterprise or AIMS is not supported to deploy on cloud environment.</p>
<p>From a licensing and warranty stand-point, we are not allowing cloud-based deployment of MapGuide Enterprise 2011 (or previous releases for that matter) – one of the primary reasons being that we have not yet dedicated resources to engineer and test the core server for cloud-based deployment. It’s one of the many things we are considering at the moment in our product plan for future releases.</p>
<p>I can also share with you a information, one Japanese customer did install MapGuide Open Source 2.0 in Amazon EC2 successfully.</p>
