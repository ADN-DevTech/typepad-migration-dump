<p>By <a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/infrastructure/augusto-goncalves.html">Augusto Goncalves</a></p>  <p><strong><u>First things first</u></strong></p>  <p>If you are not aware, we have a <a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/infrastructure/2014/05/infraworks-360-rest-api-tech-preview-available.html">Infraworks 360 API Pilot</a> going on since mid last year and you can even try a <a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/infrastructure/2014/10/importing-alignment-from-infraworks-360-to-civil-3d.html">small sample with Civil 3D Alignments</a>. If you want to work with this API, contact us with more information about your needs.</p>  <p><strong><u>Back to the topic</u></strong></p>  <p>A new version of the Infraworks 360 REST API is now live! There are some cool new representations available.</p>  <p>First, we removed the /data/ on all URIs, which made it more simple. The objects on the model, previously known as <strong>classes</strong>, are now <strong>features, </strong>and the model object now has boundary information and proposals list.</p>  <p>The major addition is the <strong>Proposal </strong>representation that can be fully accessed via <em>/model/::mode_id::/proposals/::proposal_name::</em> and is also available under the model representation (just a list of names). </p>  <p>With proposals, all the features are now listed under each proposal with <em>models/::model_id::/proposals/::proposal_name::/::feature_name::/:feature_id::</em></p>  <p>Now the new basic structure is: <strong>models</strong> that contains <strong>proposals</strong> that contains <strong>features</strong> (e.g. roads, buildings, trees, constraints, etc).</p>  <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security#TLS_1.2">TLS 1.2</a> security is required on calls to the server. If you are using .NET it should be easy, just set the security protocol with:</p>  <p><em>ServicePointManager.SecurityProtocol = SecurityProtocolType.Tls12</em></p>  <p><strong><u>Updated .NET library and sample</u></strong></p>  <p>To demonstrate the new and previous representations available on the API, we have remodeled the library and sample available at the <a href="https://github.com/ADN-DevTech/Infraworks_API_Samples">Github repository</a>. This project was also migrated to .NET 4.5 (required to support TLS 1.2) and all references migrated to newest versions (e.g. RestSharp).</p>  <p>Below is a quick view of the sample running with: models, proposals, features types, list and details.</p>  <p><a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/.a/6a0167607c2431970b01b7c78555bd970b-pi"><img title="IW360 Sample app" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline" border="0" alt="IW360 Sample app" src="/assets/image_46fbdc.jpg" width="488" height="363" /></a></p>
