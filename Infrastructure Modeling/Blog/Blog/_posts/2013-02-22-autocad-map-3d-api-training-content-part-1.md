<p>Most of you
working on customizing and application development on AutoCAD Map 3D must be
aware of broad range of API support in Map 3D which includes ActiveX, AutoLISP,
ObjectARX, Geospatial Platform, Feature Data Objects (FDO) and Industry Data
Model (aka Topobase) API.&#0160;</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>Here is a
quick highlight of these APIs and their supported technology platform -&#0160;</p>
<p>ObjectARX and
FDO are exposed as C++ and also .NET.&#0160;</p>
<p>Geospatial
Platform is exposed as .NET only.&#0160;</p>
<p>Industry Data
Model (aka Topobase) API gives access to Industry Data Model (aka Topobase)
feature and functionalities in Map 3D using .NET.&#0160;</p>
<p>ActiveX and
AutoLISP cover Autodesk Data Extension functionality (ADE), which includes
drawing sets, queries, and object data.&#0160;</p>
<p>AutoLISP also
covers map plotting and topology.</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>AutoCAD <strong>Map
3D Wikihelp</strong> (<a href="http://wikihelp.autodesk.com/AutoCAD_Map_3D">http://wikihelp.autodesk.com/AutoCAD_Map_3D</a>
) contains online API reference documents and the related Developer&#39;s guide
which are very detailed and helpful in application development on Map 3D.</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>So, why am I
writing all these which are nothing new to Map 3D developers and developer community?
Ok, here is the reason - We have thought to publish the relevant Map 3D API
training content through our Infrastructure Modeling DevBlog (<a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/infrastructure/">http://adndevblog.typepad.com/infrastructure/</a>
). </p>
<p>In a series
of blog posts in the coming days / months you will see most of the Map 3D API
training content (PDF and code samples) will be published here. In today&#39;s post
I am attaching the Map 3D Geospatial Platform API Overview&#0160;<span class="asset  asset-generic at-xid-6a0167607c2431970b017d41366eb6970c"><a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/files/chapter-1.pdf">Chapter 1</a></span>.</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>Hope this is
useful to you!</p>
