<p>By <a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/infrastructure/augusto-goncalves.html">Augusto Goncalves</a></p>  <p><a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/.a/6a0167607c2431970b01a51193f051970c-pi"><img title="infraworks-2015-banner-lockup-331x66" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; margin: 0px 15px 0px 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="infraworks-2015-banner-lockup-331x66" src="/assets/image_5fd8c7.jpg" width="240" align="left" height="48" /></a> </p>  <p>By now, you’re aware and have started using the <a href="http://www.autodesk.com/products/infraworks-family/overview">Infraworks 360</a>, the Autodesk solution to manage larger-scale infrastructure models created from existing data sources and generate proposals and early design concepts more effectively in the context of the built environment. </p>  <p>The main approach is that we can rapidly generate data-rich proposals to better predict how design alternatives may perform in the existing environment. Even more than that, it leverages the power of the cloud to transform the way infrastructure professionals manage <strong>big data</strong>, create 3D models and collaborate on infrastructure projects.</p>  <p><strong><u>Collaboration on the cloud</u></strong></p>  <p><a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/.a/6a0167607c2431970b01a51193f059970c-pi"><img title="quantitative-real-time-feedback-thumb-252x150" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; margin-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; margin-right: 0px" border="0" alt="quantitative-real-time-feedback-thumb-252x150" src="/assets/image_e30368.jpg" width="210" align="right" height="127" /></a> Autodesk InfraWorks 360 Pro’s cloud-based technology provides nearly anywhere, anytime access via desktop or mobile devices for stakeholders to view and/or collaborate on project models.</p>  <p>Taking advantage of this collaboration feature, we’ll start a project to design a full magic and legendary world, using the big data approach, crowdsourcing and all well-known APIs designed by Autodesk and used by the community for years.</p>  <p><u><strong>About the pilot</strong></u></p>  <p>As expected, this pilot design project will start with a region that contain all major objects treated by Infraworks 360, including caves, stone trolls and talking forests. The first region will include the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mordor">black land of Mordor</a>. </p>  <p>Like any project of this nature, it will start by the entry point, the black gate. The servers are already and in place and the first draft ready, as you can see on image below.</p>  <p><a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/.a/6a0167607c2431970b01a3fce43316970b-pi"><img title="black_gate" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="black_gate" src="/assets/image_a47b5f.jpg" width="493" height="267" /></a><em><font size="1">(Initial gate model downloaded from </font></em><a href="https://3dwarehouse.sketchup.com/model.html?id=237a0777376a823f6a6392f94efcb239"><em><font size="1">here</font></em></a><em><font size="1">)</font></em></p>  <p><strong><u>Count me in!</u></strong></p>  <p>I’m sure that by now you are eager to join the Fellowship, indeed the quest is noble and all those with good heart are welcome to try.
