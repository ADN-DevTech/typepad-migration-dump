<p>We are in the process of recording a DevTV on &quot;<strong>AutoCAD Map 3D 2013</strong> - new Features and API&quot; which we are going to upload this week. We are not hosting a separate &quot;Live Q &amp; A&quot; session on Map 3D API; you can use the comment section here to ask your question on Map 3D 2013 API, alternatively you can use <a href="http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/AutoCAD-Map-3D-Developer/bd-p/84">Map 3D Developer discussion Forum</a> to post your question. Those who have access to <a href="https://partnercenter.autodesk.com/siebel/prmportal_enu_eidm/">Partner Center</a>, please use the same to ask your question and we will respond to that.</p>
