  body: 'Aren''t you Disposing trans twice? Once in the finally block and once invisibly
    as you leave the using clause?

  body: "Hi Chuck,\n\nThanks for the comments! In this particular code snippet it's\
    \ redundant; I have updated the code snippet accordingly, but it might be useful\
    \ in a larger code sample where exceptions are not handled appropriately and in\
    \ that situation we should call trans.Dispose() and I would rather use it in this\
    \ way :\n\nfinally\n{\n if (trans != null)\n   {\n      trans.Dispose();\n   }\n\
    }\n\nThanks,\nPartha\n-----"
