    VS doesn´t find the next words in the code:

    "Editor"

    "Database"

    "Transaction"

    "objectIDcollection"


    I have imported(using) the next namespaces and others:

    using Autodesk.Civil.ApplicationServices;

    using Autodesk.Civil.DatabaseServices;

    using Autodesk.Civil.Runtime;

    using Autodesk.Civil.Settings;


    Which references *.dll do I have to add or import namespaces? Thank you.'

    You need the following .NET references:


    AcMgd.dll

    AcDbMgd.dll

    AcCoreMgd.dll (2013 only)

    AecBaseMgd.dll

    AeccDbMgd.dll


    All references are at the Civil3D folder. Please try that and let me know.

  body: 'Hello Augusto.


    I don´t understand a thing.




    In this line "foreach (AlignmentEntity alignEnt in align.Entities)" is supposed
    to start at the order of entities in the drawing, but using the debugger, I do
    not understand what order continues to go naming each entity.


    For example, if I start with a line and then I have an entity SCS, until appoints
    five Alignmentline, the following is not AlignmentSCS.


    What criteria is to order and how you could get a Database with sorted entities?
    I would like a database as if the alignment table.


    Thank you.'

    You should use GetEntityByOrder instead, which requires a ''for'' on the index.


    There are a couple samples at <a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/infrastructure/2012/08/replacing-alignment-entities.html">http://adndevblog.typepad.com/infrastructure/2012/08/replacing-alignment-entities.html</a>
