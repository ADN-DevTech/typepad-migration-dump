  body: 'on the lines

    public static List GetDisplayStyleLayer(

    and

    style, new object[] { enumValue }) as DisplayStyle;


    for both "List" and "object[]" I get the following error

    "Expected class, delegate, enum, interface or struct"


    any suggestion on how to fix.

    thanks'
