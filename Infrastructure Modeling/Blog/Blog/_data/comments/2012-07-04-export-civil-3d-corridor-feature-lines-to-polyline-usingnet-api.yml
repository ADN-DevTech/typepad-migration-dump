    thanks for post, i would like to ask you how to solve the problem when the featureline
    is cut in the corridor. When i try your example it generated line which copy the
    corridor but than the line is cut so to the next point ,where the line started
    again, i see straight line across the corridor.


    thanks for advice'

    Could you send me screenshots of this result / scenario vs. what you are expecting
    here ? You might have to handle this with your own logic to identify the cut.


    Thanks,
