  body: 'Hi Andres,


    AIMS is designed to serve Map online. If you are looking for a way to upload DWG
    file to AIMS server you can use Infrastructure Studio API. Infrastructure Studio
    has DwgLoadProcedure which we can use to load DWG files to AIMS server.


    Does this info help ?


    Thanks,

  body: "Hi Sherwin,\n\nAFAIK there is no API to export to old SDF i.e. 'SDF2' for\
    \ old MapGuide 6.5 or earlier.\nYou need to use either MAP2SDF UI tool / command\
    \ in AutoCAD Map 3D or you can use SDF Loader. \n\nSDF Loader is included in SDF\
    \ ToolKit, and it can be downloaded from http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/ps/dl/item?siteID=123112&id=4307350&linkID=9240658\n\

    No, these APIs are not exposed in LISP / ActiveX.
