  body: "Hi,\n\nI've been searching for info on how to best create a mobile version\
    \ of our AIMS site.  The mobile version that comes with MG has a lot of issues\
    \ so I was hoping to just develop a standard one from jqueryMobile and openlayers.\
    \  \n\nI came across your blog and thought there might be a different way to accomplish\
    \ this instead and was going to read your PPT but the file is not accessable.\
    \  It seems to be missing from the Buzz network.\n\nDo you have a different location\
    \ for this document or perhaps some samples of how to better achive creating a\
    \ mobile version using more standarized libraries such as jquerymobile?\n\nthanks."
