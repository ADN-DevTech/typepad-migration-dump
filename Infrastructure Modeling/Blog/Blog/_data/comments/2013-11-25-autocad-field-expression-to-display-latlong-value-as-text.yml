    The field string is showing the coordinates for the point and since the point
    happens to be within the limits of the lat/long values, it works.  If you were
    to have a point that was at a state plane coordinate, is there a way to show the
    latitude and longitude for it with a field?


    Thank you,

    Stacy'
