  body: 'I am contractor employ kindly guide me about my problem which I face in Autocad
    civil 3D 2012.

    1. When we start a new project as contractor 1st of all our surveyor take jointly
    level N.S.L (natural surface level) with the consultant surveyor.

    2. Horizontal alignment data and vertical data were given on working drawing which
    provided by the consultant to the contractor.

    My question is how I can import the N.S.L in autocad civil 3d 2012 for making
    surface, cross sections and other question is how I can draw the horizontal data
    and vertical data which is provided in hard copy as mentioned in working drawing.
