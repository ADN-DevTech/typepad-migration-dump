  body: Do you have a way to control cover areas in infrastructure and hove they impact
    on existing ground. They should be controlled better so that the landscape can
    be molded better and more exact.

  body: Sorry but I do not understand your requirement. But it is possible to embed
    a base layer like Google Maps/Bing Map, etc to AIMS with flexible web layout.
    Not sure whether it is what your want to do...

  body: Hi Daniel, how do we integrate Google Maps or Google Earth Enterprise to AIMS?
    We are an electric utility and currently migrating our electrical facilities data
    from Mapguide 6.3 to AIMS 2013. But there is a need to align the same facilities
    data to a new base map which in our case is possibly Google Maps or Google Earth
    Enterprise.

  body: 'Integration with Google Map/Bing Map/Yahoo Map is part of built-in functionalites
    of AIMS 2013, you can set it up in Infrastructure Studio, and you need to use
    flexible web layout.
