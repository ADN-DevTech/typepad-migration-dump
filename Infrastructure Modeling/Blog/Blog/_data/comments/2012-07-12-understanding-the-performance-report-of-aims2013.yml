  body: "Since Windows Server 2008 SP2 IIS uses \"ApplicationPoolIdentity\" identity\
    \ for application pool process (not the NetworkService such at was early). \n\
    So we need to grant access to the folder to user \"AppPool\\%app_pool_name%. For\
    \ me it was IIS \"AppPool\\MapServer2014AppPool\".\n-----"
