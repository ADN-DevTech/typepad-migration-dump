    \ In civil 3d 2010, there is a method,varIntPt = objSurf.IntersectPointWithSurface(varStartPt,\

    \ 2012. I used C3dSurface.IntersectWith(acLine, Intersect.OnBothOperands, IntersectPoint3d,\
    \ 0, 0), but it can not find Intersections.\n      Could you tell me which method\
    \ we can use to find Intersections between cad line and civil tinsurface."

  body: 'Hi Arthur,


    I don''t have Civil 3D 2012 at the moment in my machine to check what''s the issue
    with IntersectPointWithSurface(), however in Civil 3D 2014 .NET API I see the
    following which should be useful for you -


    Surface.GetIntersectionPoint()


    -> Gets the intersection point with surface by the specified point and vector.
