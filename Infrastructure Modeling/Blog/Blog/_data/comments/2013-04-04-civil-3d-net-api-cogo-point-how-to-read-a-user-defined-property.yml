  body: 'Hi Michael ,


    I don''t have Civil 3D 2012 currently installed in my machine to confirm, but
    I think it won''t work in 2012 release as COGO point .NET API was not exposed
    in 2012 release. If you have 2012 installed in your machine, please check the
    Civil 3D .NET API assembly.


    Thanks,

    Partha
