  body: 'Its very hard to make non-version independent add-ons in my experience. I
    have to split out portions of code where the .net api is different between versions.
    This leads to one .net project per acad version, which is annoying. I have several
    "helper" projects too, so its a lot of stuff.

    I wish I could see more posts on real life project organization and what impacts
    it has, as that is what is hard about .net.'

  body: '"''second try cast, which will return Nothing case it is impossible


    oAeccCorridor = TryCast(oCorridor.AcadObject, AeccCorridor)


    ''cast succeeded?


    If (oAeccCorridor Is Nothing) Then"



    could you elaborate on your comment please, specifically "case it is impossible"?


    & shouldn''t the IF statement be testing thatoAeccCorridor is NOT nothing?'

  body: 'Steve,


    About #1, the cast should always be possible. But if you have the wrong references,
    then the cast may not happen... that''s why we have this TryCast


    Now #2 you are right, but the code is checking ''If NOT (oCorridor Is Nothing)
    Then'' because the ''is not'' will not compile...
