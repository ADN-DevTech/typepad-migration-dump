    One question regarding surface labels...


    If I wanted to add a selection for the style to be used and wanted to list all
    the styles for a spot elevation label, how can I get the child styles? I know
    how to get the parent styles through  Dim styles As ACD.Styles.LabelStyleCollection
    = CivilDoc.Styles.LabelStyles.SurfaceLabelStyles.SpotElevationLabelStyles, but
    the Child styles are stumping me.


    I would suppose they would be a part of the parent style. So my thought was to
    check the children count on each style, and if > 0 then loop through the children.


    Are child style stored under Item? If so, what else is stored under item, as it
    throws errors when I try to cast the each item to a LabelStyle type.


    Thanks.'

  body: 'Partha,


    One additional question I ran into the other day is apply the surface labels to
    an XREF''d Drawing''s surface. The Civil 3D command allows for this, and I''ve
    actually been able to do it with .NET as well. My issue is that when a surface
    label is applied to the ObjectID of a surface that resides in the XREF, the label
    is embedded into the XREF block in the current drawing. Thus leaving it unselectable
    or modifiable - and deceiving to other users as the label is not technically in
    the XREF drawing - just in the XREF block of the current drawing.


    Can you point me in the right direction to make this work?


    Thanks.


    Steve'

  body: 'Hi Steve,


    There is no direct way to achieve it other than opening the Xref file and do the
    modifcation using .NET API. In ADN Knowledge base we have a devnote on "Editing
    Xref In-place" that lists the detailed steps using C++ / ObjectARX API.


    Thanks,

    Can you clarify a bit more with this, because I''m not looking to edit the XREF
    at all, just reference it. In Civil 3D it is possible to do add a surface label,
    select an XREF''d surface and place the label. The label resides in the current
    drawing, but the datasource surface is the XREF''d surface.


    I have achieved this for the most part by searching through the block table for
    record entities that are of the Civil 3D surface type. Then I add a label referenced
    to the surface object. It does work, however the label is embedded in the XREF
    block of my current drawing. I want the label to be in the current drawing and
    reference the XREF surface.


    Are you saying it''s not possible to achieve because it''s not available in the
    .NET API?


    Thanks.
