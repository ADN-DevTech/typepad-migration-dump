  body: "Hi Augusto,\n\nI was wondering if you know anything about the unhandled exception\

  body: 'Mehdi,


    In fact this Prompt option will only work for Database resident entities... as
    the BaselineRegion is not one of those, it will not work...


    Note there is no ObjectId property, meaning is not a database entity...


    Hope this clarifies.


    Regards,

  body: "Augusto,\n\nI also have a question about an Unhandled Exception.  I wrote\
    \ a program that downloads GIS data.  The URL has the year in it, and this varies\
    \ from file to file.  It runs through a loop using different years and calls the\
    \ following function to check the URL before downloading:\n\n    Public Function\
    \ CheckURL(ByVal URL As String) As Boolean\n\n        Try\n            Dim request\
    \ As WebRequest = WebRequest.Create(URL)\n            Dim response As WebResponse\
    \ = request.GetResponse()\n            response.Close()\n            request =\
    \ Nothing\n            response = Nothing\n\n        Catch ex As Exception\n \
    \           Return False\n        End Try\n\n        Return True\n\n    End Function\n\
    \nWhen I compile a standalone executable, it runs perfect.  When I copy this into\
    \ the Civil3d template and call the command after net-loading the .dll, it crashes\
    \ at the \"GetResponse()\" line when the URL is not valid.  Why does it work in\
    \ a standalone, but not in Civil3D?  I can't figure out why the 'try-catch-ex'\
    \ doesn't catch this exception like it is supposed to.\n\nAny thoughts would be\
    \ greatly appreaciated.  Thanks!"
