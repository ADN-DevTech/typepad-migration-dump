    Do you have any training or labs that you could share for AutoCAD Civil 3D API?
    Just like the ones on the Learning section of the Autodesk Developer Network

    Thanks'

    The most updated material would be Developer Guide at http://help.autodesk.com/cloudhelp/2015/ENU/Civil3D-DevGuide/files/GUID-DA303320-B66D-4F4F-A4F4-9FBBEC0754E0.htm


    Would that help?
