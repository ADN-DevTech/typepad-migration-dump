  body: "Hi,\n\nHow do you properly set fusion's config.json? We are currently implementing\
    \ flexible web layout but we're having issues in utilizing FUSION's API because\
    \ of the current setup  defined in config.json. We're getting an error message\
    \ \"Error loading configuration file, initialization aborted. Make sure you have\
    \ copied config_dist.json to config.json and have configured the settings for\
    \ your system.\"\n\nNote: config_dist.json is already named as config.json \n\n\
    Hope to hear from you soon. Thank you very much."

    I did not do anything with config.json, just using the default one which is installed
    by installer. I don''t think it is necessary to  modify this file except you have
    particular needs.'

  body: "Hi Daniel, \n\nThank you very much for the quick reply. I imported fusion.js\
    \ and when I try to run the application, I'm getting the error message \"Error\
    \ loading configuration file, initialization aborted. Make sure you have copied\
    \ config_dist.json to config.json and have configured the settings for your system.\"\
    \ What may be the possible cause for having such kind of error? \n\nAgain, thank\
    \ you very much.\n-----"
