    You can have N profile part view showing a specific pipe or structure, use Part.GetProfileViewsDisplayingMe
    to get all profile view part.

  body: '1-N ProfileViewParts per NetworkPart? So at least 1 ProfileViewPart per NetworkPart...?


    I observe that if you select one certain ProfileViewPart in a Profile View, then
    all ''ProfileViewParts'' for the corresponding NetworkPart is selected. So there
    seems to be only one ProfileViewPart object "behind the scenes"..


    And my point is that ProfileViewPart.Bounds includes the Bounds for all the ''ProfileViewParts''
    of a NetworkPart. Hence if the NetworkPart is set to be drawn in say two Profile
    Views, then the line you draw above will span from View number 1 to View number
    2.'
