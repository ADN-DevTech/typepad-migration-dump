  body: 'Anton,


    That''s a nice idea, thanks for sharing.


    In fact your code will work in-process, but not for automation (e.g. driving AutoCAD
    or Civil 3D from an external application), unless you expose your idea through
    a COM Interface.


    My post was not clear on the scenario: COM Automation


    Thanks again!


    Cheers,
