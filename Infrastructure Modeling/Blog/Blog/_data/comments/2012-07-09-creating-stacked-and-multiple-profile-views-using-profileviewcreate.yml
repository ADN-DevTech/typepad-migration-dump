  body: Hello Partha, I just want to ask if it is possible in VB.NET to replace the
    source baseline alignment of a certain Profile View and Profile? Just like we
    have in corridor?

  body: "Hi Zeus,\n\nI am not very clear about your requirement here. Can you replace\
    \ the source baseline alignment of a certain Profile View and Profile using Civil\
    \ 3D UI ? Do we see this option in any of the Civil 3D UI dialog ? \n\nThanks,\n\
    Partha"
