  body: Why accessing MPolygon.PatternColor property (readin g the property value)
    causes fatal error. The proeprty is { set; get}. Setting the color is OK. I tried
    it with AcadMap2009 (32bit) and AcadMap2012(64-bit), behaved the same. Is this
    a bug? If it is, is Autodesk going to fixed eventually?

    I have seen this issue and same is reported to our QA & Engineering team. I am
    expecting a fix to come in future release, but at this point of time, I can''t
    comment on when exactly this fix would be available.


    Thanks,
