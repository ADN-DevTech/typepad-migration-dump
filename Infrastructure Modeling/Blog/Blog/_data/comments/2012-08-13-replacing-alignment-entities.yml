  body: 'After this line:

    "For i As Integer = 0 To entCount - 1"


    you should start with "Try{..."


    Because the "GetEntityByOrder" could throw an exception due to:

    This function behaves like the GUI in that disconnected alignment entities are
    not considered.'

    \ retain the ObjectId in AutoCAD API if we remove it and we replace it to another\
    \ object, but the ID of the alignment entities is an Integer value. \nCan we stablish\
    \ an old Id entity to a new alignment entity?"
