  body: "Hi,\n\n[Civil3D]\n\nI have question about setting targets for a new BaselineRegion.\
    \ I think I am getting an error that I do not understand. The code sample is below:\n\
    \nif (newTargetInfo.TargetType == targetInfo.TargetType)\n{\n    newTargetInfo.TargetIds\
    \ = targetInfo.TargetIds;\n}\n\nSurprisingly, the above code throws an argument\
    \ exception, saying that the target id is not within the expected range. This\
    \ happens when the TargetType is Elevation or Offset, and the single target ObjectId\
    \ is FeatureLine. How can such exception occur to begin with, when we are checking\
    \ TargetTypes to match? Even without that, for an Elevation or Offset TargetType,\
    \ a FeatureLine must be a valid ObjectId.\n\nYour help is gratefully appreciated!"

    Sorry about the problems you''re having...


    About this specific case, the target ID can be set via UI? The API has the same
    restrictions as the UI.


    As this question is not related to the post, the best route to get support is
    via forums.
