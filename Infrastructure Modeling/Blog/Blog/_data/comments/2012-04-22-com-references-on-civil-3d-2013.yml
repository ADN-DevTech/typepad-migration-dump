  body: NOT pleased with this change.  It's made our life much more difficult.  But
    it helps explain some of the problems we've been encountering, trying to create
    a 2013 build of our software.

  body: 'Hi Augusto,

    Thanks for clearing things up. Up until now I have built the 32 bit version of
    my Civil 3D application on a 32 bit machine - just in case, really. However, having
    read the different blog posts about migration code, I am tempted to try to build
    both versions (32 and 64 bit) of my app on my 64 bit machine. Though when I set
    platform target to x86, I do get a warning saying that the .net wrappers AecBaseMgd
    etc. (referenced from the Civil installation folder) targets a different platform...should
    I set platform target to Any CPU when building the 32 bit version?'

  body: "And I still can't get a simple test project to correctly build for both 32/64\
    \ from my Win7x64. They both build, and I can actually get the AeccApplication\
    \ and AeccDocument objects in a 32 bit OS, but attempting to access an Aecc* object\
    \ yields the Nointerface error. Just this simple line of code fails:\n AeccAlignment\
    \ align = (AeccAlignment)aeccdoc.AlignmentsSiteless.Item(0);\n\nI thought these\
    \ new changes were supposed to making things better? So far, I'm not real impressed."

  body: To build the 32 bit version of a Civil app on a 64 bit machine; is it sufficient
    to copy the dlls we want to reference, from the Civil 3D 2013 installation folder
    on a 32 bit machine, on to a folder on the 64 bit machine, and reference them
    from there, or must the 32 bit version be built on a 32 bit machine?

  body: I am now successfully building 32-bit versions on my Win7x64. I ended up copying
    the Aec* interop dll's from a x86 install to the inc-win32 folder in ObjectARX2013
    and set the references for the x86 build there. It took some trickery in the csproj
    file so all I have to do is switch platforms between x86 & x64, but it's working
    fine now. Still more work than it should've been, IMHO.

  body: And for a C++/ObjectARX project, one have to copy the .tlb-files from the
    Civil Engineering 100-folder on a x86 install, I guess?

    this with the engineers responsible, soon will publish more data. Regards.

  body: This problem would probably not exist if we could actually build .NET versions
    of our apps, and avoid the Interops.  But having so many features still missing
    from the .NET stuff, we still have to include Interops (Sheet Set Manager stuff
    is a key example for the core ACAD stuff, there's TONS of stuff in Civil 3D that
    require Interops).  If we're really supposed to switch to a .NET interface, as
    we've been told we should, for several years now, we need Autodesk to give us
    some help, and make everything available via .NET.

  body: Oh, sorry, I guess this might not help the C++ programmers...  But a FULL
    .NET API would sure help all us .NET programmers (C#, VB, F#, etc.....)

  body: 'If I copy the TLBs (AecXBase70, AecXUIBase70, AeccXLand etc) from the Civil
    Engineering 100-folder on a x86 install, on to my Win7 x64 machine to build a
    32 bit version, I get errors when trying to import them (the TLBs) in my C++-project:

    error C4772: #import referenced a type from a missing type library.


    Importing the equivalent TLBs from the Civil Engineering 100-folder on my machine
    for 64 bit build goes on without errors.
