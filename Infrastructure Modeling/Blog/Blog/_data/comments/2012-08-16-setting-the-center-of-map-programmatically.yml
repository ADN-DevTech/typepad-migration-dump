  body: 'Daniel,


    Thanks very much for this function.  It helped me greatly. I created a modified
    version of this function to zoom to a specific point on a map at a specific scale.  I
    need for the zoom to occur when called from the click event handler of a button
    on a modal form.


    The problem is that the zoom does not occur until the user closes the modal form.  I''ve
    tried everything I can think of and posted on the boards.


    Any ideas?  Thanks again!


    Steve
