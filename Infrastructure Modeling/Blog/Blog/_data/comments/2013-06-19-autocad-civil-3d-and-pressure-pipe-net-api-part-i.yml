    \ documentation available yet on Pressure Pipe .NET API. \n\nFor all the Objects\
    \ in Civil 3D .NET API you can get the API Reference doc as well as Develoer Guide\
    \ link from my earlier blog post - \n\nhttp://adndevblog.typepad.com/infrastructure/2013/04/autocad-civil-3d-2014-developer-documents.html\n\
