  body: 'Hi,

    I''ve been having a hard time trying to use the UDP Names as QueryString using
    CustomPointGroupQuery.

    Something like:

    pGrp.UseCustomClassification(cls);

    ...

    CustomPointGroupQuery qry = new CustomPointGroupQuery();

    ...

    qry.QueryString = "(Title=''" & sTitle & "'' AND HoleType=''" & sBHtype & " AND
    Location=''" & sLocation) & "'')";

    pGrp.SetQuery(qry); ---> this part crashes with :PointGroupQueryParserException:
    Unsupported property name found


    Where Title, HoleType and Location are UPD Names created under Classification.



    Any help is greatly appreciated...


    Thanks,
