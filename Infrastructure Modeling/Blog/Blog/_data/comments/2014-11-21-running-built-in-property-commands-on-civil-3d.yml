  body: "Hi, Augusto\nwould you please help me to solve the following issue?\n\nI\
    \ am developing a plug-in for AutoCAD Civil 3D 2015 on .NET C#. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xmcz4kZDTx4&feature=youtu.be\n\
    \nThis plugin is used for export 3d objects to Google earth. With help of Brep\
    \ i get all information about 3d objects and write it to Collada. During the export\
    \ plug-in works without errors, even with a lot of 3d objects. I dispose unused\
    \ objects and use the \"using\" statement. But after exiting Civil 3d, occurs\
    \ an error. \nhttp://dl2.joxi.net/drive/0006/2797/457453/150109/a1c3898e0a.jpg\
    \ \nProblem signature:\nProblem Event Name: APPCRASH\nApplication Name: acad.exe\n\
    Application Version: 26.0.51.0\nApplication Timestamp: 52f4adcc\nFault Module\
    \ Name: accore.dll\nFault Module Version: 20.0.51.0\nFault Module Timestamp: 52f4ae8b\n\
    Exception Code: c0000005\nException Offset: 00000000006d9cef\nOS Version: 6.1.7601.2.1.0.256.48\n\
    Locale ID: 1033\nAdditional Information 1: 59bc\nAdditional Information 2: 59bc2f24ac83312559015d6dcf3c387a\n\
    Additional Information 3: 2949\nAdditional Information 4: 2949d7b14d7a156deca638281aa20dfa\n\
    \nAs i have understood it is Access Violation Exception, that throws when we try\
    \ to access the objects that are disposed..\nThis error occurs just after working\
    \ with a large objects or with a lot of objects (not when closing a drawing, but\
    \ when exiting the Civil)\n\nHere is some dumpdata... http://dl1.joxi.net/drive/0006/2797/457453/150109/90a47db9d6.jpg\
    \ \nHow can I fix this problem, has you any ideas?\nAny help would be appreciated!"

  body: "Hi Valeria,\n\nThis is a tricky problem. As you mentioned, it's probably\
    \ related to reading data from a invalid object... \n\nPlease do the following:\
    \ run your code again and, when the problem happens, submit the error report with\
    \ your email, I'll track from here.\n\nAlso, as this question is not related to\
    \ this blog post, please log at our forum, we'll have a better tool to talk there:\
