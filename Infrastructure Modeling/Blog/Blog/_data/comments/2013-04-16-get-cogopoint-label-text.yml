  body: 'Hi Augusto,


    Only commenting on the conceptual aspect of this, would it not instead be simpler
    for the API Author to include a GetDisplayedTextString() Method?


    Think similar to extracting the TextString Property of a Text entity which includes
    a Field reference... The evaluated result is returned, and not the FieldCode.


    This Method (and it''s overload(s)) would need to account for multiple components
    given the myriad ways a Point Label Style can be configured, of course, so it
    stands to reason that perhaps returning a List<string>, etc. would be required,
    and only apply to the COGO Point''s current Style(s).


    Again, just a quick, upper level thought... Obviously there would be a need to
    dig further to ensure no deal breakers were the API Author to consider the suggestion.


    Cheers'

  body: 'That''s a good point: indeed you should call .Dispose() if the Entity is
    not appended to the database. Thanks for pointing that out.
