  body: 'Dear Daniel,


    Thank you very much indeed for your efforts. I had been looking for some tutorial
    on .NET and AIMS. Thanks to you I found some. But unfortunately I couldn''t find
    the source code in your attached zip files for solutions 5 & 6. Can you kindly
    provide us the source code so that a newbie like me could start developing? I''ll
    be highly obliged.


    Also if possible, can you share with us other solutions also?'
