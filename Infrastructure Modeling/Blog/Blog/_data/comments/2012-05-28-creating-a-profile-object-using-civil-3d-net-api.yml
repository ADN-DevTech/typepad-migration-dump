  body: Interesting article! Is the method for creating a QuickProfiles almost the
    same? I have tried this for some time but didn't succeed. Maybe you can help?

  body: 'Hi Surajit,


    I don''t see any public API available at moment to create a Profile from a file
    which is equivalent of the UI command _AeccCreateProfileFromFile, sorry. I am
    logging a wish list to address this in future release of Civil 3D.


    Thanks,

  body: 'Hi Ulrikw,


    My apologies for missing your comment earlier :(


    If you are referring to the CREATEQUICKPROFILE command which draws temporary profiles
    along line, arc, polyline, lot line, feature line etc., then I find the direct
    or equivalent public API is missing in the current release. However, Profile.CreateFromFeatureLine()
    would help in creating a Profile from a corridor feature line.

    For a quick Profile, we should be able to work-around with few extra steps (though
    I haven''t tried yet), however, an equivalent API to UI command CREATEQUICKPROFILE
    or _AeccCreateQuickProfile would be a better option. I am logging a wish list
    for the same to expose a .NET API equivalent for CREATEQUICKPROFILE or _AeccCreateQuickProfile.



    Thanks,
