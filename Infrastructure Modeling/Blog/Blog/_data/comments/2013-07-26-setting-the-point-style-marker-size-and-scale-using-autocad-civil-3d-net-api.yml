  body: Is it possible in Civil3d to have the size of the point style base on field
    points. Let's say, first point shot is at the center of the electrical pullbox,
    next shot is middle west side and the last point shot is at northwest corner of
    the pullbox. So the actual dimension of the utility will be shown.

  body: "Hi Mary,\n\nAre you talking about using same Style object but with different\
    \ scale factor ? \nOr different Style object (may be using same block as symbol\
    \ marker and other similar properties) but a different scale for marker ?\n\n\
    Thanks,\nPartha\n-----"
