    I don''t mind packaging one up and posting over at TheSwamp, but it would be helpful
    to know where I can find and include prior versions for 2010-2012, etc..

    Could this plug-in be revised to allow one to open a Civil 3D model as a side
    Database instead of being relegated to the active Document?


    Separately, it would also be nice if the form were modeless (perhaps even a dockable
    Tool Palette?), and updated following changes to the Database dynamically.


    Cheers'

    Now a palette feature will be complicated due the transaction required to open

    Emyr,


    The first think is make sure you are NETLOADing from a local drive. If still not
    working, check more at this post:

    The apps you''ve created was great,but i do have a question. Is this possible
    to work if instead of using the activedocument, i would use


    Database db = new Database(false,true)

    db.readdwg(file)

    CivilDocument cDocs =  CivilDocument.GetDocument(db)


    I was able to read the dwg but i always get an error on the getting count of the
    of collection "Get Count Failed"

    It should be possible, although I have not tested. The main reason is to support
    multiple versions (as this code was originally designed for C3D2012).


    Not sure why you need to inspect the non-current document, but you need to make
    sure all pieces are calling over this document (such as transaction and other
    runtime objects).
