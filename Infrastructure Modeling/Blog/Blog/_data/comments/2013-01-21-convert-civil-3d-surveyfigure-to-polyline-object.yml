    As a side note, I don''t believe there is a need to call GetProjectedCurve() unless
    you want to project the baseCurve to a plane other than world.


    Also, if the survey figure has different elevations at each vertex the curve information
    will be represented as 3d line segments.  In order for the curve data to come
    across in that situation, you would need to flatten the figure first.

  body: 'Thanks Mark ! You are right. GetProjectedCurve() is redundant here, unless
    someone want to project the baseCurve to a plane other than world. To retain the
    curves as it is we can simple get the BaseCurve and add that to DWG database using
    AddNewlyCreatedDBObject(). I have updated the original code snippet above to make
    it simpler.

  body: 'Hi Jim,


    You need to build a simple .NET plug-in app using this code and Civil 3D .NET
    API assembly. Then netload your application in Civil 3D and call your custom command.
    In the following link you will see useful resource like DevTV to build your plugin
    for Civil 3D or AutoCAD.

    That code snippet is the same for Feature Lines to convert to polylines?


    Can I get Id of polyline after this:?

    " trans.AddNewlyCreatedDBObject(baseCurve, true);"


    I would like to get a ObjectIdCollection of news polylines for erase later.


    Thank you.'

  body: 'Partha,

    I have tried .basecurve, .GetProjectedCurve and .GetOrthoProjectedCurve to generate
    a 2d polyline, but each method will not generate a polyline with arc segments.  They
    are the only approximated curves with line segments.


    The only way I can get a polyline with curves is to flatten the figure to a dummy
    surface first.


    Is there another method or is there a way to programatically flatten the figure
    to the same elevation?


    Thank you,

    Stacy'

    You said that there is no need to flatten, but each method I have tried does not
    produce a polyline with curves.


    I tried:

    survfig.BaseCurve

    survfig.GetProjectedCurve

    survig.GetOrthoprojectedCurve


    If if manually flatten the figure using a dummy suface and the AeccFeatureElevsFromSurf
    command, the polyline derived from survfig.BaseCurve will then have actual arc
    segments.


    Is there another method or a way to flatten the figure programatically first?
