  body: 'Hi,


    I am developing a Civil3D .net app using C# and need to call "Edit Style" dialog
    for a given style from the app.  For instance, let''s say the app needs to let
    the user edit a given alignment style using native Civil3D dialog. The dialog
    is accessible through the TOOLSPACE, then SETTINGS tab, but I don''t know where
    in the API.


    One way to handle this is to create a temporary alignment with the given style,
    and then use Lisp to run EDITALIGNMENTSTYLE (entlast) command, but that seems
    rather unnatural and certainly not elegant. In addition, I have to make this work
    for any Civil3D style that is accessible through the API. Is there a way of calling
    these dialogs using the API properly? Any help would be appreciated.


    Thanks!'

    Thanks for contacting. For API questions, please consider use the forum at http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/autocad-civil-3d-customization/bd-p/190


    That said, indeed we cannot access Civil 3D dialogs from the API... just some
    "not elegant" workarounds, like you mentioned.
