  body: 'Hi Avijit,


    I did a quick check and I think to use the ''Transition Length'' you need to create
    a AutoWideningInfo object and set AutoWideningInfo.TransitionLength = double value;


    And then use this AutoWideningInfo object in AddAutoWidenings (AutoWideningInfo,
    SweptCurveLocation)


    Hope this helps.


    Let me know if you need any further help.


    Thanks,

    Partha
