  body: 'Since AutoCAD Map 3D is subset of AutoCAD Civil 3D, does that mean that after
    "NETLOADING" AeccDbMgd.dll, the Civil 3D console can also be used with AutoCAD
    Map 3D API?


    I have tried the console with AutoCAD Map 2014 installation with Map API: code
    based on MAP API does not run in the console. However, I may have to do similar
    thing as you described here: NETLOADING some MAP specific managed assemblies first?'

    I have tried to use MAP API in console with AutoCAD Map 2014 installation and
    failed. Have not tried it with Map 2015/16.


    Also, since AutoCAD I/O services are the online version of console, does that
    mean Civil API (or other vertical AutoCAD products, for that matter) is/will be
    available with AutoCAD I/O?'

    \ ensure it's loaded. I haven't tried with Map (don't have it installed), have\
    \ you trie NETLOADing them?\n\nIn fact the Console is an AutoCAD feature, that's\
    \ why I used this workaround (NETLOAD the API DLLs).\n\nAlso, this approach is\

    AutoCAD I/O does not yet support C3D specific assemblies. When we use it locally
    we''re actually using all C3D files installed locally, but I/O is a vanilla AutoCAD.
