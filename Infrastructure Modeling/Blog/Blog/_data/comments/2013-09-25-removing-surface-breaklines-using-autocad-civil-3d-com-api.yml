  body: 'this is a big deal, as I recall I could only remove groups of breaklines
    before.

    I have tools that make 3d plines and add to a surface. Updates need the ability
    to remove items and add on a pline by pline basis.

    Are you sure this does not refer to groups of breaklines, as that is not what
    I need. thanks'

  body: "James,\n\nIt's being a while... but I made some testing with this: the RemoveAt\
    \ will act at the operation level, not at each breakline. For instance, if you\
    \ add a Std Breakline and select 3 plines, the RemoveAt will remove all 3 plines.\n\
    \nDatabase db = Application.DocumentManager.MdiActiveDocument.Database;\nusing\
    \ (Transaction trans = db.TransactionManager.StartTransaction())\n{\n  TinSurface\
    \ tinSurface = trans.GetObject(surfaceId, OpenMode.ForWrite) as TinSurface;\n\
    \  for (int b = 0; b < tinSurface.BreaklinesDefinition.Count; b++)\n  {\n    SurfaceOperationAddBreakline\
    \ operation = tinSurface.BreaklinesDefinition[b];\n\n    // the RemoveAt will\
    \ act at this level\n    ed.WriteMessage(\"\\n{0}\", operation.Description); \n\
    \n    foreach (SurfaceBreakline breakline in operation)\n    {\n      // this\
    \ level don't have a Remove method...\n      ed.WriteMessage(\"\\n\\t{0}\", breakline.Description);\n\
    \    }\n  }\n  //tinSurface.BreaklinesDefinition.RemoveAt(...);\n  //tinSurface.Rebuild();\n\
