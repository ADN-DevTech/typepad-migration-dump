  body: looking at the code, you are iterate through the pline to create the network.
    In 2015 API is there a method to simply create a network from pline? if yes, are
    there any samples on how to create a pipe network from a pline in C#. Is there
    a list somewhere of all the methods, functions etc.

    In fact this code is not following the PLINE at every point, but only at specific
    parameters...


    But if you need to follow the PLINE, use as shown at http://adndevblog.typepad.com/infrastructure/2012/06/do-you-want-to-programmatically-convert-polyline-to-civil-3d-alignment-object.html
