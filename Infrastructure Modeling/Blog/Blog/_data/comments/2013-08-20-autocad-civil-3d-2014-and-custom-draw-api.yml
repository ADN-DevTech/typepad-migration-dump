  body: 'Hi Partha,


    Thanks for the lib files. I link to this file and manage to build, but when my
    C3D 2014 add-on receives the AcRx::kInitAppMsg message and tries to do the following:

    acrxLoadApp(_T("AeccCustomDraw100");

    then I get this message from C3D:

    "AeccCustomDrawRes.dll not found"


    However acrxLoadApp returns true and I''m allowed to set my callback...Any idea?'

    Thanks for the lib-files! However, when my C3D 2014 add-in receives the AcRx::kInitAppMsg
    message and tries to load the Custom Draw app module (AeccCustomDraw100), C3D
    pops the following message:

    AeccCustomDrawRes.dll not found


    I''m allowed to set my callback, but the message box is a show stopper.'

    I understand this is fixed in SP1.
