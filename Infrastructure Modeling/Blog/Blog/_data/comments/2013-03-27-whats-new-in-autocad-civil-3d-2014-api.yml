  body: 'Hi Partha,

    Thanks for the update! It is quite troublesome to expose to the user, in the Toolpalette,
    assemblies and subassemblies that are stored in atc-files (and has associated
    dlls). It would be great if much of that work could be handled by the API. Initially
    I thought/hoped that the new importsubassembly/assembly-functionality would handle
    this, but having looked into it more in-depth, I understand that this is not the
    case? The new functionality just mimics what is done when the user selects an
    assembly or subassembly from the Toolpalette and put it into the drawing? (In
    my case though, Civil handles this for me since I already have my assemblies in
    the Toolpalette)'
