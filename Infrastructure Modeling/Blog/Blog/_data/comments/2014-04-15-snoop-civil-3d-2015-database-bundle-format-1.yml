  body: 'Hi Malcolm,


    Actually you just need to place the .bundle at the specified location, no need
    to manually NETLOAD the DLL.


    That said, you may need to ''unblock'' the DLL following this post: http://labs.blogs.com/its_alive_in_the_lab/2011/05/unblock-net.html

    it would be great if the tool will be updated for versions 2017 and 2018. Any
    change to realize it?
