  body: 'Hey.

    I''m a noob at Mapguide and i just started to work with MG OpenSource. So i would
    like to ask you if this is applicable to open source version as well. Because
    in MGOS (2.4 version) i can''t seem to find or enable the authentication settings
    (login) for fusion layout.This question is probably more suitable for MGOS forum
    but since i read this blog article of yours (and i really like your articles-very
    informative) i wanted to ask you directly.


    Thanks!'
