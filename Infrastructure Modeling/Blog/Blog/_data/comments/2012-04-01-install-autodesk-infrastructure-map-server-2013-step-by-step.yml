  body: Thanks for your comment! Yes, installing MapServer on windows 7 is not supported.
    Considering that many developers, including me, are using windows 7 as development
    OS, so it may be helpful for developers to create a development environment without
    changing OS. Since there are some similarities between IIS on win7 and Windows
    server 2008, hope it is helpful when installing map server on a production environment.
