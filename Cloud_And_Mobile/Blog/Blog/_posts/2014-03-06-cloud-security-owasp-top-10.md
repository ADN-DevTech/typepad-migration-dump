<p>By <a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/cloud_and_mobile/gopinath-taget.html">Gopinath Taget</a></p>  <p>With great emphasis on cloud and web application these days, it is important to to understand what it takes to keep the cloud application and application data secure. For that, it is necessary to know what the different kinds of vulnerabilities are and how web application get attacked. Unfortunately, just like desktop applications, there are a very large number of ways web applications can be attacked and vulnerabilities exploited. So what do you do and where do you start?</p>  <p>The best place to start is with the <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2013-Top_10">OWASP top 10</a>. <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Main_Page">OWASP</a> (Open Web Application Security Project) is a non-profit organization focused on application security. The OWASP top 10 lists a set of 10 very common vulnerabilities in web applications and how to fix them. Fixing these potential vulnerabilities go a very long way in building robust web applications.</p>  <p>Over the next few weeks I will discuss each of these vulnerabilities and how to fix them.</p>
