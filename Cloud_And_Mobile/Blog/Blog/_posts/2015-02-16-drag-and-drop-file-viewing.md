<p>In the past when you got a design data file then you had to figure out what product you could use to view it:<br /><a href="http://usa.autodesk.com/support/viewers/" target="_self" title="">http://usa.autodesk.com/support/viewers/</a></p>
<p>Now, if you have an A360 account then you can simply drag and drop the file onto the following webpage and see the model:&#0160;<a href="https://360.autodesk.com/viewer" target="_self" title="">https://360.autodesk.com/viewer</a></p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://360.autodesk.com/viewer" style="display: inline;" target="_self"><img alt="Viewer" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0167607c2431970b01bb07f1cae9970d image-full img-responsive" src="/assets/image_b1d750.jpg" title="Viewer" /></a></p>
<p>This is also a good way to test the View and Data service that we provide - see&#0160;<a href="https://developer.autodesk.com" target="_self" title="">https://developer.autodesk.com</a></p>
