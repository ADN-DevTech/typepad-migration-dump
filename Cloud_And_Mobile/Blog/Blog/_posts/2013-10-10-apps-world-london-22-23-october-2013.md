<p>My colleague, Peter Schlipf and I will be attending this conference both days: <a href="http://www.apps-world.net/europe/" target="_self">http://www.apps-world.net/europe/</a> <br /> 
If you are around and would like to discuss something or just want to say hello, then please contact us, so that we don&#39;t miss each other. :)<br />The event has an &quot;Apps World Connect&quot; networking tool that can be used to reach out to other attendees.&#0160;</p>
<p>See you there!</p>
