<p><a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/.a/6a0167607c2431970b01bb07d5888a970d-pi"><img align="left" alt="Screen Shot 2015-01-08 at 1.03.55 PM" border="0" height="252" src="/assets/image_1560ce.jpg" style="margin: 0px 10px 0px 0px; display: inline; border-width: 0px;" title="Screen Shot 2015-01-08 at 1.03.55 PM" width="216" /></a>You&#0160; will start by learning the API and developing a plan for writing your sample application(s), which you will then implement. As you progress you will be blogging about your experiences using the API so others can follow in your steps. The finished samples will be posted to our public GitHub account and used by our Developer Evangelists around the world to showcase the API capabilities. There may be opportunities to attend hackathons, meetups and conferences as a sponsor to help spread the word about these amazing APIs.</p>
<p>In short, your task will be to have as much fun as possible doing cool things with our APIs – and then telling other people about the cool stuff you’ve done.</p>
