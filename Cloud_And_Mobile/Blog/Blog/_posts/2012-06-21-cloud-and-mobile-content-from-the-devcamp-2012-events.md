<p>We recently concluded the <a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/autocad/2012/04/devcamps.html" target="_blank">ADN Devcamp</a> events for the AEC and Manufacturing industries at Waltham and Portland respectively. The content for these events (PPTs, documents and code samples) can be accessed from <a href="https://projectpoint.buzzsaw.com/DevCamp2012/AEC?public" target="_blank">here</a>. At this location, you will find AEC and MFG folders. If you are looking specifically for Cloud and Mobile content, you will find it under the <a href="https://projectpoint.buzzsaw.com/_bz_rest/Web/Home/Index?folder=44#/_bz_rest/Web/Item/Items?folder=51" target="_blank">4 Cloud Mobile and Other</a> subfolder under the AEC folder and under <a href="https://projectpoint.buzzsaw.com/_bz_rest/Web/Home/Index?folder=44#/_bz_rest/Web/Item/Items?folder=292" target="_blank">Track#4 Cloud and Mobile Technologies</a> subfolder under the MFG folder.</p>
