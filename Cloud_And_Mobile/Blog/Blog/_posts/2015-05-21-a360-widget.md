</p>
<p>Here's a cool new feature developed by our A360 team - a widget you can add to any web page that allows you to drag and drop a design file to view it. </p>
<p>The full instructions for embedding this are available at <a href="http://360.autodesk.com/viewer/widget" target="_blank">360.autodesk.com/viewer/widget</a>. However, I found that the required initialization to call is 'adskViewerWidget.Init()', and not 'adskViewerWidget.init()' as the instructions state. (I.e. You need to capitalize the 'I').</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
<div id="widgetContainer">&nbsp;</div>

<script >
var adskViewerWidget = adskViewerWidget("prod");
adskViewerWidget.Init('#widgetContainer', false) //Parameter "false" can be empty in this case;
</script>
</p>
<p>Update - Jeremy Tammik has a more detailed write-up on the widget over on his blog - <a href="http://the3dwebcoder.typepad.com/blog/2015/05/50-ways-to-view-your-model.html">http://the3dwebcoder.typepad.com/blog/2015/05/50-ways-to-view-your-model.html</a>. Also, there is a problem when embedding the widget on Typepad. You'll see the embedded widget works fine on its home page for all browsers, but drag and drop on Typepad (i.e. the widget above) isn't working for any browser except Chrome. The widget should work fine on your own webpage - just not in a (Typepad) blog. We've reported the problem to the dev team.</p>
<p>Update 2 - I forgot to mention the widget is currently a preview version. Go ahead and use it, but enhancements will be coming soon.</p>
