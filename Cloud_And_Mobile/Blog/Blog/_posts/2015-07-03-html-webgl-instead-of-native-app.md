<p>By&#0160;<a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/cloud_and_mobile/adam-nagy.html" target="_self">Adam Nagy</a></p>
<p><a href="http://dances-with-elephants.typepad.com/blog/about-the-author.html" target="_self">Jim</a>&#0160;brought <a href="http://www.cnet.com/news/how-photo-app-polarr-topped-the-app-store-the-uncommon-way/" target="_self">this</a> article to my attention, but then an hour later saw <a href="http://www.paulirish.com" target="_self">Paul Irish</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/paul_irish/status/616729414542340096" target="_self"> tweeting about it</a> as well. :)</p>
<p>This just shows how powerful HTML apps are becoming, getting closer and closer to native apps in every way.</p>
<p>Just a quick list of things to support this:</p>
<p>- <strong>Offline functionality</strong>&#0160;used to be one of the main distinguishers of web and native apps. So&#0160;<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Using_the_application_cache" target="_self">AppCache</a> has been introduced which helps HTML apps in this regard<br />&#0160; - In iOS you can even&#0160;<a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/iad/documentation/AppleApplications/Reference/SafariWebContent/ConfiguringWebApplications/ConfiguringWebApplications.html" target="_self">add a home screen icon</a>&#0160;for an HTML app, just like for native apps<br />- <strong>3D graphics</strong> used to be the domain of native apps, but&#0160;<a href="http://caniuse.com/#feat=webgl" target="_self">WebGL</a> has been introduced which also became pretty ubiquitous once iOS started supporting it as well in version 8<br />- <strong>Speed&#0160;</strong>is another differentiator. Now all major browser providers are working together on <a href="https://medium.com/javascript-scene/what-is-webassembly-the-dawn-of-a-new-era-61256ec5a8f6" target="_self">WebAssembly</a>&#0160;which will enhance HTML app performance considerably</p>
<p>Looking through the related materials also ran into <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZqhRICne_M&amp;t=16m20s" target="_self">this video</a> where <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Eich" target="_self">Brendan Eich</a>&#0160;(probably most known for creating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript" target="_self">JavaScript</a>) mentions <a href="http://www.autodesk.com" target="_self">Autodesk</a> as well. :)</p>
