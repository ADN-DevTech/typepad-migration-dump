<p>I just finished reading

<a href="http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1118176073.html">
Trillions &ndash; Thriving in the Emerging Information Technology</a> by

Peter Lucas, Joe Ballay, Mickey McManus of

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAYA_Design">MAYA Design</a>,

distributed to all Tech Summit presenters.

<p>It discusses design and technology for pervasive computing, provides numerous shockingly obvious and often quite old insights, a very critical view of our current use of Internet and so-called cloud technologies, and an inspiring and thrilling read.</p>

<p>The topic is how to harness and live <b>in</b> &ndash; as opposed to 'with' &ndash; the unbounded complexity of the trillion-node network of connected devices that we are inevitable heading towards, and will lead to catastrophe unless we radically change some fundamental aspects of the ways we handle and share information.</p>

<p>I highly recommend reading this book.</p>

<p>I highly recommend abstaining from all use of the word 'cloud computing' until you have completed it :-)</p>
