<p>By <a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/aec/xiaodong-liang.html" target="_self">Xiaodong Liang</a></p>  <p>My colleague Jeremy wrote&#160; a nice sample on workflow of Viewer &amp; Data API in Python:    <br /><a href="https://github.com/Developer-Autodesk/workflow-python-view.and.data.api">workflow-python-view.and.data.api</a></p>  <p>To help my learning on Python, I just used this sample to practice. The sample has implemented authentication, set token, create bucket, upload file and register file. I simply wrote a piece of code to get thumbnail. </p> <script src="https://gist.github.com/xiaodongliang/cd1d6b69feb417e9e2fe.js"></script>
