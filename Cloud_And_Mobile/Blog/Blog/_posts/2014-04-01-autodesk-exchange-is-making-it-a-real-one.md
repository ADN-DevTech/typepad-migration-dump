<p> By <a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/cloud_and_mobile/daniel-du.html">Daniel Du</a></p>  <p>Two years back, Autodesk launches its first AppStore – <a href="http://apps.exchange.autodesk.com/en">Autodesk Exchange</a>, and it grows very fast, even faster than what we expected. By the time of writing, we have more than 20,000 apps on sale and more than 16,000 downloads per day, and the number is still growing. As you thought, user sell and buy Apps on AppStore – officially named as Autodesk Exchange, actually. Beside the apps, which is generally a downloadable plug-in for Autodesk products, Autodesk has already expanded the business to sell web services, i.e. an URL which provides various service online, you probably have already bought/subscribed some from Autodesk Exchanges. Since the Exchange business is so successful, we decided to expend the business beyond the IT industry, to make it a real exchange. I am pleased to announce that Autodesk Exchange is now launching several new stores.&#160; </p>  <p>Are you travelling?
