<p>This blog has now moved to become part of our Forge website. Please change your bookmark to:</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://forge.autodesk.com/blog">https://forge.autodesk.com/blog</a></h2>
<p>We&#39;ll be posting the same types of programming tips and tricks in the new blog - along with additional items, such as events, case studies and Forge product roadmap updates.</p>
<p>See you over on the new site.</p>
<p>(No more posts will be published on this site, but we&#39;ll keep it active for a while to give everyone time to re-bookmark to the new site)</p>
