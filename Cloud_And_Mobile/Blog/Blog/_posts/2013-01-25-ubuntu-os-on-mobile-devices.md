<p>I have just run into the following website about Ubuntu on mobile devices (Ubuntu for phones):&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/devices/phone" target="_self">http://www.ubuntu.com/devices/phone</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I found it really interesting. This is the first full fledged desktop OS that I'm aware of which is planned to be available on a mobile phone as well. Microsoft is doing something similar with Windows 8 on Surface Pro, which is coming next month, but that is a pad and not a phone.</p>
<p>Also the user interface on the phone seems very good - as far as I could see from the videos on the net. It will be very interesting to see how things work out with Ubuntu on mobile devices. Could be something to watch out for. :)</p>
<p>If you have an Android phone and don't want to change the OS, then you will also be able to use it as an Ubuntu desktop device when docked (Ubuntu for Android):&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/devices/android" target="_self">http://www.ubuntu.com/devices/android</a>. Looking for it on the internet trying to download it, I ended up on these sites which seem to suggest that it's only available if the phone manufacturer made it available for the specific handset:&nbsp;<a href="http://askubuntu.com/questions/181384/can-i-download-ubuntu-for-android-to-my-mobile-device" target="_self">http://askubuntu.com/questions/181384/can-i-download-ubuntu-for-android-to-my-mobile-device</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.itbusiness.ca/it/client/en/home/News.asp?id=69699" target="_self">http://www.itbusiness.ca/it/client/en/home/News.asp?id=69699</a><br />So it's "work in progress" at the moment.&nbsp;</p>
