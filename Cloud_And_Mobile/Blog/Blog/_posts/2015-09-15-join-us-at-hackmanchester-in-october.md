<p>By&#0160;<a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/cloud_and_mobile/adam-nagy.html" target="_self">Adam Nagy</a></p>
<p>We’re excited to announce that&#0160;<a href="http://www.autodesk.com">Autodesk</a>&#0160;will be sponsoring a challenge at&#0160;<a href="http://www.hackmanchester.com">HackManchester</a>&#0160;this year in Manchester, UK. This is the first time we have been formally involved in the event, although some of our developers have taken part in previous years. This time I too will join this event with many of my colleagues from the Autodesk Sheffield office.</p>
<p>Autodesk has a long tradition of innovating with&#0160;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKWH05ZP9Bk">3D technologies</a>&#0160;&#0160;and for this challenge we thought we would ask developers to think about new and innovative ways 3D can be used to drive online content. &#0160;So, after much discussion we have come up with the following challenge:</p>
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; /* css 3 */
    white-space: -moz-pre-wrap; /* mozilla, since 1999 */
    white-space: -pre-wrap; /* opera 4-6 */
    white-space: -o-pre-wrap; /* opera 7 */
    word-wrap: break-word;">Most innovative, exciting, whacky, crazy, mind blowing use of our <a href="http://lmv.rocks/">View and Data API</a> 
to visualise and interact with 3D data. We will provide a bunch of datasets on the day 
(e.g. cars, buildings, city blocks, toasters, etc.) but it would be great to see something completely new.</pre>
<p><strong>The Judge: </strong><a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/cloud_and_mobile/adam-nagy.html" target="_self">Adam Nagy</a><br /><strong>The Prize:</strong>&#0160;£1000 worth of amazon vouchers</p>
