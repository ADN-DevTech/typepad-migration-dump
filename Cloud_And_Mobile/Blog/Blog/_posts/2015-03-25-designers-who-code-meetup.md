<p>I spoke at Designers Who Code Meetup showing some cool demos of the View and Data API last night at the Autodesk Gallery in San Francisco. I showcased downloading and instantly viewing a 3D model downloaded from Herman Miller&#39;s website, and some cool models from <a href="https://lmv.rocks/" target="_self">lmv.rocks</a>.&#0160;</p>
