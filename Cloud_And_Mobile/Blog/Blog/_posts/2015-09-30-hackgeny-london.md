<p>Last week I attended <a href="http://www.hackgeny.com/london/" target="_self">HeckGenY London</a>&#0160;hackathon which we also sponsored. The event focused on the younger generation and so for many of the participants it was the first hackathon experience :)</p>
<p>A couple of the teams decided to give our <a href="https://developer.autodesk.com/api/view-and-data-api/" target="_self">View and Data API</a> a try and integrate it into their final product. One of those teams consisted of 4 boys, all under 16, who managed to put together a 3D search engine that was collecting model files from various places, and then displayed them using our solution.</p>
<p>Considering their age and the time they had to put it all together it was a pretty impressive solution and so not only did they get the <a href="http://www.autodesk.com/" target="_self">Autodesk</a> prize but were also given&#0160;3rd place by the judges. :)</p>
<p>Well done guys!</p>
<p>In the picture it&#39;s the team with me on the right, and in the front the <a href="http://hackgeny.com/" target="_self">HackGenY</a> organizers: Sacha Nasan and&#0160;David Tabachnikov.</p>
