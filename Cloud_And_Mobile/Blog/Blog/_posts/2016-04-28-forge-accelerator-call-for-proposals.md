<p>As part of our Forge DevCon week, we&#39;ve scheduled our next Autodesk Forge Accelerator (formerly known as the <a href="http://autodeskcloudaccelerator.com/" target="_blank">Autodesk Cloud Accelerator</a>) for June 19-24 inclusive in our San Francisco office . If your application is accepted, you will spend the week in our office working on your projects that make use of Autodesk Forge APIs - with the help of the ADN DevTech team and members of the Autodesk engineering teams. The Autodesk Forge APIs include the View &amp; Data, AutoCAD I/O, BIM 360, RecCap Photo and Fusion 360 APIs - as well as a number of new APIs that will be launched at the conference. You can find a full list of APIs at <a href="http://forge.autodesk.com" target="_blank">forge.autodesk.com</a>.</p>
<p>To apply for this program, you will need to submit a proposal of not more than 2000 words describing the project you&#39;d like to work on and how it will make use of the Autodesk Forge APIs. More information on how to apply is available here - <a href="http://autodeskcloudaccelerator.com/apply/" target="_blank">http://autodeskcloudaccelerator.com/apply/</a>.</p>
<p>Instead of setting a deadline for proposals, we&#39;ll be accepting suitable projects as they come in, so don&#39;t wait too long!</p>
<p>I&#39;m looking forward to receiving your application.</p>
<p>We&#39;re deliberately holding this Accelerator the week after Forge DevCon, so you can come for the conference, spend the weekend at the hackathon (details to be announced soon), and then attend the Accelerator - all in one trip. Why not register for the <a href="http://forge.autodesk.com/conference/" target="_blank">Forge DevCon</a> today.</p>
