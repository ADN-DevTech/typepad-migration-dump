<p>By <a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/autocad/stephen-preston.html">Stephen Preston</a></p>  <p>Attending the <a href="http://www.evansdata.com/drc/2013/" target="_blank">Evans Data Developer Relations conference</a> on Monday, I was lucky enough to find myself sitting next to <a href="https://twitter.com/johnmusser" target="_blank">John Musser</a> at lunch. John is the founder of <a href="http://www.programmableweb.com/" target="_blank">ProgrammableWeb</a>. Embarrassingly (and probably because I’m relatively new to the cloud API scene), I’d never come across this website before. The site attempts to provide an up-to-date directory of mashups, web APIs, and related news. </p>  <p>If you’ve not visited the site before, then its worth taking a look. The API lists will likely give you some ideas for mashups and integrations you could play with.</p>  <p>BTW John gave an excellent and very informative presentation at the conference on API business models.</p>
