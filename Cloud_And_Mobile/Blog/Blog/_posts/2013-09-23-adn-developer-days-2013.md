The theme for this year is:<strong> <em></em></strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 11pt;"><strong><em>rEvolution</em></strong><em> - Where
Desktop meets the Cloud</em></span>
</p>
<p>Got great ideas for cloud and mobile apps?&#0160; Want to learn where Autodesk is taking the
convergence of desktop computing and cloud technology?&#0160; </p>
<p>If you’re an innovator developing on Autodesk platform technology and
have not yet attended an Autodesk Developer Network Conference join us for a deep
dive as we take an in-depth look at Autodesk’s newest technologies and the next
generation of products coming in 2014.&#0160;
The Autodesk Developer Network is holding its annual, worldwide
Developer Day Conference and DevLab in cities around the world from November
2013 through February 2014.</p>
<p>Called Autodesk DevDays 2013, the theme for this year’s event is
rEvolution – Where Desktop meets the Cloud.&#0160; Come and learn about upcoming
releases of several new web service APIs from Autodesk.&#0160; You’ll see how
these new web services extend the power of the desktop: delivering easy
collaboration, limitless compute power and big data – and are platforms that
can deliver the same to you and your customers.&#0160; It’s an opportunity to
learn about a range of “360 based” web service APIs delivering you Cloud based
platforms for a number of industries - Manufacturing, AEC, Infrastructure and
more. And, we will of course also cover what’s new in the next releases of our
desktop products (AutoCAD®, Autodesk® Revit®, Autodesk® Inventor®, AutoCAD® Civil
3D® and so on)!</p>

started.</p>
