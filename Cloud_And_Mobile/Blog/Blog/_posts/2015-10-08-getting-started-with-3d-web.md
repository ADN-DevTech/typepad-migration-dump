<p><strong>Update 10/20/15:</strong> I presented very similar content at the HTML5DevConf yesterday. (Adding this note so people finding this material from there know its the same thing). I&#39;m also adding links to all the tools at the end of the post.</p>
<p>On Tuesday evening, I presented my &#39;Getting Started with 3D Web&#39; presentation for the first time at our inaugural &#39;I Love 3D San Francisco&#39; meetup. The presentation summarizes the results of my ongoing search to find some simple tools that allow me to embed 3D content into a webpage with the least possible effort.</p>
<p>I wasn&#39;t able to record the presentations live, so I&#39;m posting a screencast I recorded of the same content as I was preparing for the meetup. Here is the video:</p>

<p>&#0160;I&#39;ve also <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/StephenPreston5/getting-started-with-3d-web" target="_blank">posted the slides to SlideShare</a>, but they aren&#39;t so informative, as most of the presentation was demos. (I.e. Watch the video, not the slideshare)</p>
<p>I&#39;ll be delivering this presentation again at the HTML5DevConf in San Francisco (Oct 19-20, 2015).</p>
<p>The other &#39;I Love 3D&#39; presenter for the night was 3D Web rockstar, <a href="http://www.tonyparisi.com/" target="_blank">Tony Parisi</a>, who talked about &#39;Getting Started with WebVR&#39;. Tony&#39;s PPT slides are <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/auradeluxe/introduction-to-web-vr-fall-2015" target="_blank">posted here</a>.</p>
