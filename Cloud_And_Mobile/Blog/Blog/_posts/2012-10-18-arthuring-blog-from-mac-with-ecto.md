<p>This post may be a little off the topic of cloud and mobile, but if you are developing iOS mobile application, you must be using Mac. If you happen to be a blogger as well, this post may be helpful for you. Actually I am a newbie to Mac, I have been using LiveWriter to publish blog post on Windows, and I always want to find an alternative on Mac. Then I found "<a href="http://illuminex.com/mac/ecto/">ecto</a>", it is so great that I am eager to share with you :)</p>
<p>Ecto supports most BSPs including typepad, it even has localized UI, you will notice that my screen-shots are in Chinese :) Here is how to setup ecto to support typepad.</p>
<p>When you run ecto first time, you need to setup the your blog account, click "new" button, input your blog title, select system of your BSP, of cause I am using typepad here. For Typead, the access point is <span style="font-family: STHeiti; font-size: medium;">http://www.typepad.com/t/api,</span> <span style="font-family: STHeiti; font-size: medium;">then input your username and password, you account will be ready.</span></p>

<p>If you are using other system than typepad, the access point can be found <a href="http://ecto.kung-foo.tv/docs/pgs/tocEndPoints.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>Once you log in, ecto will retrieve your published posts, you can start a new post by clicking "new " button. In the blog editor, you can author your post, auto spell checking is also available, so sweet! iIs it function of Mac or ecto? I don't know, anyway, it is pretty useful, especially for people like me, who do not speak english as first language. It is also possible to switch between HTML and RichText mode. My most favorite feature is inserting image, sometime I need to post some screen-shots, I just make a screen-shot with other tool(or pressing prtsrc key ) and then paste the screen-shot into the editor directly, it is pretty convenient, without bothering myself to save the screen-shot as file then insert from file.</p>
<p>The categories are listed on the left, checking appropriate categories before publishing, it is also possible to adjust the date/time of publishing.</p>

<p>Okay, you may want to try yourself now, go ahead to get one. :)</p>
