<p><a href="http://jqueryui.com/">jQuery</a> UI is another JavaScript based UI
component I found very interesting and useful. </p>
<p>What is it? As
mention in <a href="http://jqueryui.com/">jQuery website</a> : <em>jQuery UI is a curated set of user interface
interactions, effects, widgets, and themes built on top of the jQuery
JavaScript Library. </em>&#0160;</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>Similar to my
previous endeavor with <a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/cloud_and_mobile/2013/06/httpadndevblogtypepadcomautocad201304getting-started-with-javascript-api-on-autocad-2014html.html">fancyBox</a>
tool, I tried to use jQuery UI library to build a simple HTML application to
show how we can easily drag and drop DOM element in this case it was some
images related to a particular design project. You can download jQuery UI
library from their <a href="http://jqueryui.com/">website</a> and start play
with it.</p>
<p>
And this is how it
works -&#0160;</p>
