<p>The Autodesk Forge DevCon conference, originally scheduled for June 27-28 in San Francisco, will now be held on November 13-14 in Las Vegas.</p>
<p><strong>One time. One location. Two great conferences.</strong></p>
<p>We received feedback from many of last year&#39;s Forge DevCon attendees that it was hard to travel to two Autodesk conferences in a year. This change will allow you to attend Forge DevCon and <a href="http://au.autodesk.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Autodesk University</a> in Las Vegas in a single trip. There will be DevCon-only, AU-only, and AU+DevCon ticketing options available.</p>
<p>Because the conference will now be held five months later, we have postponed the Call For Proposals and attendee registration.</p>
<p><strong>New Date. New Location. Same Great Experience.</strong></p>
<p>Last year, our first Forge DevCon offered two-days of the most up-to-date training, technologies, news, and insights around design, simulation, reality capture, AR, VR, and IoT. It was an indispensable experience for anyone working with the Forge platform.<br /><br />At this year&#39;s event you can expect more of the same. Only more so.<br /><br />Stay tuned for updates and please visit the <a href="http://gems.autodesk.com/events/autodesk-forge-devcon-2017/event-summary-da5182da21a9407795079f65da16c75d.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Forge DevCon 2017 site</a> to learn more.<br /><br />If you have any questions please don&#39;t hesitate to contact us at <a href="mailto:forge.devcon@autodesk.com">forge.devcon@autodesk.com</a>.</p>
