<p>Our A360 team recently blogged <a href="http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/a360-blog/in-the-lab-what-s-coming-up-in-the-new-a360-viewer/ba-p/5565476" target="_blank">this nice article</a> giving a sneak peak of what&#39;s coming soon in the viewer that makes up part of our View &amp; Data API (which is also used in A360 and Fusion 360).</p>
<p>They include a link to a new viewer demo on autodesk.com that allows anyone to upload a file and share it (for a limited time) with their friends - <a href="https://360.autodesk.com/viewer" target="_blank">https://360.autodesk.com/viewer</a>.</p>
