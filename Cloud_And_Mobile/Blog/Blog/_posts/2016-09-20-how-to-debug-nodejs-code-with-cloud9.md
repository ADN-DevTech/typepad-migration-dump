<p>By Augusto Goncalves (<a href="https://twitter.com/augustomaia">@augustomaia</a>)</p>
<p>It&#39;s not unusual to see NodeJS developers writing tons of&#0160;<em>console.log</em> statements to &quot;debug&quot; code. This is really not productive and just waste of time &amp; effort.&#0160;</p>
<p>This quick video tutorial explains how to find a sample code you like on Forge@Github, fork it to your account and clone for editing on <a href="https://c9.io/">Cloud 9</a>. Then&#0160;how to setup Forge client id, secret and callback URL as environment variables. Last, how to setup a breakpoint for debug. Quick &amp; easy!</p>
<p>And did I mention Cloud 9 is <a href="https://c9.io/pricing">free for public projects/workspaces</a>?!</p>
