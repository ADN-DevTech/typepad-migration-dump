<p>In case you hadn&#39;t noticed the announcement on the Autodesk forum ...</p>
<p>As an experiment, we&#39;re scheduling an online &#39;hangout&#39; session for the Autodesk View &amp; Data API (a.k.a. &#39;the Autodesk viewer&#39;) on Wednesday 13th May at 8am PST (4pm GMT). This is an informal session where you can come along to chat, ask questions, or show off your work. For this first session, space will be limited to 25 attendees, which we think will be plenty for this first one. During the session, we&#39;ll be asking for your feedback on whether to make this a regular event.</p>
<p>We hope you&#39;ll join us. Here is the meeting info:</p>
