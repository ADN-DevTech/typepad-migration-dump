<p>We invite you to attend a webinar introducing our View and Data API Beta on Thursday October 23rd, 2014 at 8am PDT (duration approx. one hour).<br /><br />The View and Data web service API is a zero-client, browser-based viewer and associated (server-side) translation engine that will run in any WebGL-enabled browser. The viewer already supports over 60 widely-accepted design and 3D file formats, with additional formats being added regularly. The advantages of the View and Data API are that the viewer has access to the rich data embedded in the original design (properties, parameters, inter-object relationships, materials and more), and that models are streamed (so you can start interacting with a very large model without waiting for the entire file to be downloaded from the server). <br /><br />&#0160; <a class="asset-img-link" href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/.a/6a0167607c2431970b01b8d079374f970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Viewer" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0167607c2431970b01b8d079374f970c img-responsive" src="/assets/image_51da8b.jpg" title="Viewer" /></a><br /><br />APIs include a server-side REST API for uploading, translating and then accessing your 3D models, and a client-side JavaScript® API that allows fine control of the viewer itself,&#0160; including:<br /><br />-&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; Responding to events, e.g. selection and view changes;<br />-&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; Searching and displaying the rich data included in the model;<br />-&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; Manipulating the view/camera;<br />-&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; Isolating and highlighting model components based on model data search.<br />-&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; Loading 3D or 2D model representations<br />-&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; Linking 3D model objects to your own data source.<br /><br /><br />Webinar details:<br />Date: Thursday, October 23rd, 2014 <br />Time: 8 a.m. PDT (4 p.m. BST; 5 p.m. CET; 11 a.m. EDT)<br />Duration: approx. one hour<br /><br />Registration: To reserve your place send an email to <strong>adn-training-worldwide@autodesk.com</strong>.
