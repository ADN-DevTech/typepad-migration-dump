<p>Hi everybody.

<p>This is my first post to the Cloud and Mobile DevBlog.

<p>All I will do here is point out that I spent my education day last Friday exploring how to display and interact with 2D graphics in a browser using SVG and JavaScript by implementing a very simple

room polygon and furniture picker in SVG</a>.

<p>The main goal was to enable picking and identifying objects and ensuring that the same code and interaction is supported on all mobile devices, in particular both Android and Safari on iOS.

<p>Try it out on your phone or somewhere!

<p>I hope you find it useful.
