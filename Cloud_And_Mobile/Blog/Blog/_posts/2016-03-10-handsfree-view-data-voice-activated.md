<p>What if we can put the Autodesk View &amp; Data on a physical store, how a customer would interact with the 3D Models? One possibility is touch screen, of course, but what about voice?</p>
<p>This sample uses <a href="https://www.talater.com/annyang/">Annyang</a> and <a href="http://responsivevoice.org/">Responsive Voice</a> libraries to drive the model. Yes it&#39;s not 100% accurate (when understanding commands), but it&#39;s quite good. And it works in many languages (tried myself in Brazilian Portuguese).&#0160;</p>
<p>See it in action:</p>
