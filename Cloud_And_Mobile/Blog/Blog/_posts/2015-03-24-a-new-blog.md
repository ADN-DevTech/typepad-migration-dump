<p>Congratulations and good luck to our very own Jeremy Tammik on launching his new web/cloud/mobile/cool technology programming blog - The 3D Web Coder (<a href="http://the3dwebcoder.typepad.com/" target="_blank">http://the3dwebcoder.typepad.com/</a>).</p>
<p>Based on his prolific output in his previous blog (The Building Coder - <a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/" target="_blank">http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/</a>), I&#39;m expecting Jeremy&#39;s new enterprise to quickly become the goto blog for all things &#39;3d web&#39; and Autodesk cloud platform APIs. Subscribe to it now and get in on the start of something special.</p>
