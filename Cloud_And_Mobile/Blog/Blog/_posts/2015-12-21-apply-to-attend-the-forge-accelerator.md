<p>A &#39;hot off the press&#39; announcement - We&#39;ve just set the date for our next Autodesk Forge Accelerator (formerly known as the <a href="http://autodeskcloudaccelerator.com/" target="_blank">Autodesk Cloud Accelerator</a>). The Forge Accelerator will be held in our San Francisco office from March 14th to 18th inclusive. If your application is successful, you will be invited to spend the week in our office working on your projects that make use of Autodesk Forge APIs - with the help of the ADN DevTech team and members of the Autodesk engineering teams. The Autodesk Forge APIs include the View &amp; Data, AutoCAD I/O, BIM 360, RecCap Photo and Fusion 360 APIs.</p>
<p>To apply for this program, you will need to submit a proposal of not more than 2000 words describing the project you&#39;d like to work on and how it will make use of the Autodesk Forge APIs. More information on how to apply is available here - <a href="http://autodeskcloudaccelerator.com/apply/" target="_blank">http://autodeskcloudaccelerator.com/apply/</a>. (Note that this page hasn&#39;t yet been updated to include this latest event - that&#39;s how &#39;hot off the press&#39; this announcement is :-)).</p>
<p>If your application is successful, we will provide you with accommodation at an Autodesk designated hotel. All other travel and living costs are at your own expense.</p>
<p>&#0160;The deadline for submitting proposals is January 31st 2016. I&#39;m looking forward to receiving your application.</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
