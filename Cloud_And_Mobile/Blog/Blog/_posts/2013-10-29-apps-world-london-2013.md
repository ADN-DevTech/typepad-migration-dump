<p><a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/cloud_and_mobile/adam-nagy.html" target="_self"></a>My colleague and I attended this event last week. It was quite busy, full of various companies exhibiting.<br />Their services ranged from app monitoring, building and testing software to full app design and delivery. List of attendees:&#0160;<a href="http://www.apps-world.net/europe/exhibitions/exhibitors" target="_self">http://www.apps-world.net/europe/exhibitions/exhibitors</a></p>
<p>On the way in we ran into an ADN member as well,&#0160;<a href="http://www.linknode.co.uk/" target="_self">http://www.linknode.co.uk/</a></p>
<p>There were many lectures and panels from which the most interesting topic to me that kept coming up was HTML5 vs native apps. I drew the following conclusions from the discussions about HTML5 (some of which I already knew): <br />
- implementing a cross platform HTML5 solution can be just as expensive as creating multiple native apps<br />
- lots of available components create confusion about which ones to use<br />
- very few people are really good at JS<br />
- java is completely different from JS<br />
- JS is a third class citizen on some devices<br />
- big apps are written in other languages<br />
- it&#39;s the UI you will be fighting with<br />
- try to keep most code on server side<br />- if you want to use JS but also need native functionality, then use solutions like <a href="http://phonegap.com/" target="_self">PhoneGap</a><br />- some companies do prototyping in HTML5, but the final app will be native&#0160;<br />
- use HTML5 if developers already know JS - e.g. in case of a web development team</p>
<p>Another interesting thing was <a href="http://www.appmachine.com/" target="_self">AppMachine</a>, which can be used to create an app by putting various components together like a LEGO structure.
Depending on how successful this product becomes it could be interesting for companies to provide their own building blocks as well to make it easier for 3rd parties to consume their services.</p>
