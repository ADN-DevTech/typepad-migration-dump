<p>By&#0160;<a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/autocad/announcing-apphack-20.html">Stephen Preston</a><a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/.a/6a0167607c2431970b01b8d093ba27970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Cloud accelerator image" height="358" src="/assets/image_82d9ab.jpg" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Cloud accelerator image" width="480" /></a><br /><br />Following the huge success of our <a href="http://autodeskcloudaccelerator.com/" target="_blank">inaugural Autodesk Cloud Accelerator program</a> earlier this month, we&#39;re now in the planning stages for <em>Cloud Accelerator v2</em>. This will be held in our San Francisco office from June 1st to June 12th 2015. The format will be the same as the first - if you have an idea for an application you can build using any Autodesk Cloud Platform API, then you&#39;re eligible to apply.</p>
<p>Our Accelerator website (<a href="http://autodeskcloudaccelerator.com" target="_blank">autodeskcloudaccelerator.com</a>) will be updated very soon with the new Call for Proposals, but you’re welcome to email &lt;<span style="color: #0000bf;">adn-training-worldwide@autodesk.com</span>&gt; as soon as you like with a&#0160; proposal. The deadline for proposals will be April 19th 2015.</p>
<p>To maximize your chance of success, bear in mind that the two main criteria we’ll be evaluating your proposal against are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Can the proposed workflow be achieved using the Autodesk API in its current state – we’ll be looking for evidence in your proposal that you’ve already evaluated the capability of the Autodesk API you want to use.</li>
<li>Could the application developed during the Accelerator go on to become a commercial product (or a component of an existing commercial product).</li>
</ul>
<p>When submitting your proposal, please make sure you include the following information in your submission email:<br /><br />Your company <br />&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;Name:<br />&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;Address:<br /><br />Proposer - the individual to contact about proposal<br />&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;Name:<br />&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;Telephone:<br />&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;Email address:<br /><br />Attendees – the names and email addresses of the one or two people who will attend the accelerator<br />&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;Attendee 1 Name:<br />&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;Attendee 1 Email:<br /><br />&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;Attendee 2 Name:<br />&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;Attendee 2 Email</p>
<p>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;Will the attendees be staying in the Autodesk provided hotel accommodation?&#0160; Yes | No</p>
