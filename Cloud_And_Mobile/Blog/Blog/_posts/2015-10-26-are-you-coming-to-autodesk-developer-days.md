<p><strong>Autodesk DevDays 2015 and (new this year) Accelerator week</strong></p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://www.autodeskdevdays.com" style="float: left;" target="_blank"><img alt="Making Things Happen_Twitter" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0167607c2431970b01b8d16d309c970c img-responsive" src="/assets/image_2acd08.jpg" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px;" title="Making Things Happen_Twitter" /></a>Spend quality time in the cloud and learn where Autodesk is taking the desktop platforms in the coming year. &#0160;<br /> <br />The annual, global — and free — Autodesk DevDays events will take place around the globe from November 2015 through to January 2016. In order to give developers more opportunity and to provide one-on-one help building apps using Autodesk web services, Autodesk is changing the format this year.&#0160; DevDays will be week-long events including the traditional DevDay event on the first day and then an optional — but highly recommended — 3-4 day (depending on location) abbreviated form of our extremely popular Autodesk Cloud Accelerator program.<br /><br />Our annual DevDays events have always been the best way that our Autodesk Developer Network partners keep up to date with new and upcoming technology and features.&#0160; This time we’re expanding the opportunity not just to learn, but also to work with us by getting expert help for your projects. <br /><br />Attend DevDays to discover Autodesk 360ws – the technology and business platform for a new generation of connected Cloud, Web and Mobile apps and services such as <strong>View &amp; Data, AutoCAD I/O, Fusion 360, BIM 360, Recap 360</strong>, and InfraWorks 360. See and learn about the upcoming enhancements in the capabilities and APIs of the next Desktop platform releases.&#0160; Visit www.autodeskdevdays.com to learn more about these and other topics to be featured during DevDays and to see the available locations. <br /><br />The Accelerator workshops during DevWeek are an unparalleled opportunity for you to learn and work intensively on a chosen project with help, support and training from Autodesk Cloud Engineering experts.&#0160; By investing a few days now you’ll save precious development time and accelerate your project development.&#0160; Instead of having to figure out or research a problem that could take days or weeks imagine being able to just ask an Autodesk expert. &#0160;<br /><br />If you are serious about developing on Autodesk platform technologies and have not yet attended an Autodesk Developer Network DevDays Conference join us at DevWeek for a deep dive into the exciting range of new products and services. <br /><br />DevDays is a traditional road show to a number of cities worldwide for the benefit of members of the Autodesk Developer Network who can register through www.autodeskdevdays.com.&#0160; However, we’re happy to hear from — and help innovators, forward thinkers and companies just getting started, so if you are not an ADN member and are interested in this event we invite you to contact us at <strong>devdaysinfo@autodesk.com</strong>.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; view the information, locations and schedule at <strong><a href="http://www.autodeskdevdays.com" target="_blank">www.autodeskdevdays.com</a></strong>.&#0160; Please note material demonstrated and discussed at DevDays is highly confidential and under Non-disclosure Agreement. &#0160;<br /><br /></p>
