<p>The Autodesk University Call for Proposals will close on May 26th, so there&#39;s still time to submit a proposal and get free entry to AU.</p>
<p>As track lead for the &#39;Developer&#39; track, I&#39;m particularly interested in persuading you to submit a proposal for a class or lab on an API/programming topic. Your proposal could be on an Autodesk API, but we also like to include a few classes/labs each year on general programming topics (programming languages, web/mobile/desktop programming, testing, debugging, application design, etc, etc).</p>
<p>Visit <a href="http://au.autodesk.com/speaker-resource-center/call-for-proposals" target="_blank">http://au.autodesk.com/speaker-resource-center/call-for-proposals</a> to find out more.</p>
