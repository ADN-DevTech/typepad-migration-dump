<p>By <a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/cloud_and_mobile/philippe-leefsma.html">Philippe Leefsma</a></p>  <p>If you are attending the 2014 <a href="http://au.autodesk.com/">Autodesk University</a> in Las Vegas and are interested in integrating 3D photogrammetry with your desktop and mobile App, then this class is for you. </p>  <p>Here is a description of the class and the key learnings you will get out of it:</p>  <p><em>The reality capture group at Autodesk is working on new ways to acquire, manipulate and analyze real world data using laser scans or photos through the ReCap™ technology. T</em><em>his class focuses on how to programmatically access the ReCap web API from desktop and mobile applications. </em></p>  <p><em>We start with a quick overview of basic photogrammetry concepts, followed by an introduction to REST-based web-services. </em><em>We finally expose the capabilities of the ReCap web API, showing what steps you need to take to create a 3D mesh from pictures.</em></p>  <p><em><font color="#ffffff">-</font></em></p>  <p><em>At the end of this class, you will be able to:</em></p>  <p><em>- Understand how ReCap API is working and what it can achieve</em></p>  <p><em>- Consume ReCap REST Web API from desktop and mobile Apps</em></p>  <p><em>- Get your first app working in no time through the use of API wrappers we created for different platforms</em></p>  <p><em>- Leverage the ReCap technology to create cutting edges Apps</em></p>  <p><em>- Produce high-quality meshes using advanced features of the API</em></p>  <p><font color="#ffffff">-</font></p>  <p>If that seems interesting to you, here is the reference of the class, register now on AU website! </p>  <p><em>Class ID: <strong>SD6230</strong>       <br />Class Title: </em><em><strong>Add 3D Photogrammetry to your desktop and mobile apps using ReCap Photo API        <br /></strong>Class Type: <strong>Lecture</strong></em></p>
