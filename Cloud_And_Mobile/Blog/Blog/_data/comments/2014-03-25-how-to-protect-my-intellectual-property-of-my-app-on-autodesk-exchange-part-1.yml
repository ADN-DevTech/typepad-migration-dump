  body: 'is it working, like expected?

    I''m asking because if i use ЯЯЯ as UserId and appstore.exchange.autodesk.com:фыва
    as an AppId,

    full string will be: https://apps.exchange.autodesk.com/webservices/checkentitlement?userid=ЯЯЯ&appid=appstore.exchange.autodesk.com%3aфыва


    i got {"UserId":"ЯЯЯ","AppId":"appstore.exchange.autodesk.com:фыва","IsValid":false,"Message":"Ok"}
    as a result.

    100% that there is no such AppId and UserId.

    if i use my UserId and appId of the free plugin, that i really downloaded, i got
    "IsValid":false,"Message":"Ok".

    so, for me Message is always = Ok, and IsValid is always = false. it doesnt depend
    on userId or appid at all.

    maybe it works only with paid apps, and i''ll see {... "IsValid": true...} only
    if i''ll buy an app and test this string with my UserId and AppId of the app i
    bought?
