  body: Would it be possible to use this as an extension to the embeded (iframe) model
    viewer of our models on Autodesk 360? I haven´t really been able to wrap my head
    around Data & View API just yet! :)

  body: 'Well... basically when using an iframe you have no control over the client
    side JavaScript API, so there is no way to customize an embed from A360. If you
    want customization, you need to setup your own page where you can use the viewer
    API. Also this approach only applies to pure webgl renderers, however the development
    team is working on providing similar features for the viewer and we are definitely
    going to play with anything that is VR-related... just keep watching the blog
    for some news.


    Hope that helps,

    Philippe.'

    \ run the viewer on our sharepoint site. So I have still have a few steps to master\
    \ until I will want to run it in the Oculus! :) \nI´ll sure be watching the blog\
    \ for further development. No hurry, I won´t be needing any VR related stuff until\
    \ monday! :)"
