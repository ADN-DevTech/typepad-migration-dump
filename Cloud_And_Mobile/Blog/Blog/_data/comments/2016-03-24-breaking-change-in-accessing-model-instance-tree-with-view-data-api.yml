  body: 'calling var instanceTree = model.getData().instanceTree;

    returns instanceTree as undefined.  strange?

    (is there any better documentation than https://developer.autodesk.com/api/viewerapi/?
    I''m struggling to find it useful... like what is returned by getData()?  all
    the source says is return this.myData which seems like it could be anything.  Is
    it defined somewhere?)'

  body: Maybe this is because the file is a DWFx When I select things in the viewer
    I get a lot of information about them but when I look at the model browser, it
    appears empty.

  body: "Most likely you are not waiting for the following events to fire when you\
    \ load your model so the instanceTree has not been loaded yet:\nAutodesk.Viewing.GEOMETRY_LOADED_EVENT\n\
    Autodesk.Viewing.OBJECT_TREE_CREATED_EVENT\n\nTake a look at this post:\nhttp://adndevblog.typepad.com/cloud_and_mobile/2015/08/asynchronous-viewer-events-notification.html\n\

    \nYou can simply do console.log(model.getData()) to see what is returned by this\
    \ method and ultimately looking at the source code: https://autodeskviewer.com/viewers/2.5/viewer3D.js\n\
