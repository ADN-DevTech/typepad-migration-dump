  body: 'Dear Philippe,


    You saved me a lot of time with this article. It''s a little bit old, but still
    useful. I''ve search the internet for very long hours and I haven''t find a better
    guide to this topic.


    You say: "...which works but disable the possibility for the user to interact
    with the page... When adding both renderers directly to the document, interaction
    with the page is possible, however the meshes do not get render properly in front
    of the css elements. So far I haven''t found a way to combine both results with
    a single approach."


    For this part, I found a solution (based on this project: https://github.com/jeromeetienne/threex.htmlmixer
    ). I carefully went through on his code and compared it to yours. The only main
    difference I found is that he has "pointer-events: none" on the canvas. I tried
    it on yours, and it seems to solve the interaction problem.

    I hope I could help, since you helped me a lot.


    Regards,

    Peter'
