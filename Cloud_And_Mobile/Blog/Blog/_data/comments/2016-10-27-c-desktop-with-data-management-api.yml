  body: "Augusto,\n\nThanks, the link works.\n\nI noticed that the project is marked\
    \ as deprecated. Are security concerns mentioned in the article - i.e. protecting\
    \ the client id secret - the reason it is deprecated?  \n\nI understand this is\
    \ a demo app that shouldn't be used for production but is it still a valid framework\
    \ for connecting a desktop app to Forge if I address the security concerns?\n\n\
    Cheers,\nBen"
