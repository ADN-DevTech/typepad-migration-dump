    \ SDBExplorer, you can now back up your SimpleDB domains to CSV files and restore\
    \ those CSV files to SimpleDB domains when needed. This will help you backup,\
    \ restore or copy the SimpleDB domain content much more efficiently. With the\
    \ new version of SDB Explorer, you will experience fast, multiple and parallel\
    \ Uploads, Deletes (Empty Domain + Delete Items), Exports and Imports. \n\n<a\
