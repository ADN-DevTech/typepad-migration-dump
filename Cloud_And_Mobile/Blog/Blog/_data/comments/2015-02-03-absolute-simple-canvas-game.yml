  body: 'Hi Madhu,


    That''s a good start;) Using canvas directly is pretty low-level. Implementing
    a game on that would be like coding in assembly... You may want to take a look
    at 2d libraries like http://g.raphaeljs.com/ or http://paperjs.org/ which are
    making life much easier!'

  body: 'Thanks Philippe,for your comment, yes I''m aware of those libs, I wanted
    to understand underlying dynamics of DOM & Canvas, so I intentionally avoided
    using any libraries and it was fun :)
