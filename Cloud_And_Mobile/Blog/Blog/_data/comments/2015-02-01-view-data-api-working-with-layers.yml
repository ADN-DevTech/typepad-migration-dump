  body: "Hello Phillippe, thanks for your post.\nI am trying to use it in my app but\
    \ I am facing an issue in this line:\n\n var root = _viewer.model.getLayersRoot();\n\
    \nBasically the \"model\" property is null. \n\nAm I missing something?"

    \ is it the result \"root\"? \n\nThis code only works for 2d drawings, getLayersRoot\
    \ return null for 3d models...\n-----"
