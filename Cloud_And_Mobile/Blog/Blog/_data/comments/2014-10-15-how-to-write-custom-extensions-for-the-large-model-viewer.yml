  body: 'Hi Philippe,


    I run the demo with my model, but the model does not show in the viewer. The urn
    that I use is:

    var urn = ''urn:dXJuOmFkc2sub2JqZWN0czpvcy5vYmplY3Q6YWRuLTI4LjEwLjIwMTQtMDkuMzIuNDEvVGVzdDAyLnJ2dA==''


    I get the token through a node.js server

    (https://github.com/Developer-Autodesk/AuthTokenServer_Simple)


    The viewer says "Model Structure Loading..." when clicking "Model Structure".


    Any idea?


    Thanks.


    Will'
