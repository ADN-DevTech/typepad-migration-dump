  body: It is not apparent, from your code, what the Java method `invokeMemberFuncFromNative()`
    looks like.  Where is its implementation?

  body: 'I’m trying to invoke Java method from native code. I was able to run your
    attached project and saw desired output.

    But when I run the project by keeping only “invokeMemberFuncFromNative” call,
    I’m getting following error. Can you please help to identify the issue?

    java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: no non-static method'

  body: 'wow, this is amazing! Thanks for providing this clear demonstration of how
    to hook into java objects and methods from cpp.

    I''m still confused by this, though I''ve seen it in a few examples now

    jmethodID methodId = env->GetMethodID(cls, "", "(I)V");


    is the constructor always associated with (I)V? Seems like magic.'
