  body: 'Hi,

    I''ve got the whole library and tried webpack.

    at first I received a ''typescript'' related error, after excluding typescript
    from the config file webpack ran successfully and generated .min files.

    I copied the "Viewing.Extension.Markup3D.min.js" to my extension folders and tried
    loading it but I receive this error:


    "Viewing.Extension.Markup3D.min.js:4 Uncaught ReferenceError: regeneratorRuntime
    is not defined"


    Can you please help where to start to fix the issue?

    regards,'

    if you are using webpack in your app) before any babel transpiled code:

  body: "Thanks Philippe, \nYes I thought that would be the case and tried (sorry\
    \ I had to mention in my comment). so I installed polyfill (npm install --save-dev\
    \ babel-polyfill) and added \"import \"babel-polyfill\";\" on top of the \"Viewing.Extension.Markup3D.js\"\
    \ then ran the webpack. although it made the generated min file bigger but still\
    \ I receive the same error.\nRegards\nAfshin"

  body: 'You have to add the polyfill on top of your app, not on top of Viewing.Extension.Markup3D.js
    or any other files from my library.


    This error is definitely caused by an improper loading of the polyfill. It has
    to be loaded before any other script with has been transpiled.'
