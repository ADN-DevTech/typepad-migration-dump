  body: "Hi, Augusto.\nСurrently I am trying to get access by using 3-legged OAuth\
    \ on my c# app and your post is good advice for me.\n\nI think it would be nice\
    \ to finish work on it and provide this solution as a complete project into your\
    \ GitHub account. The only source about 3-legged OAuth on desktop for Forge is\
    \ your notes here.\n\nP.S. There are few typos in code. (like BASE_URL, but FORGE_BASE_URL;\
    \ authorizeUrl, but authorizeURL). \n\n--\nBest regards,\nVitaliy"
