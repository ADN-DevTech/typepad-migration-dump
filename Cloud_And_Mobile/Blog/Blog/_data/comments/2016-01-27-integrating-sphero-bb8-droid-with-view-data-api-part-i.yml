  body: This is a great project with great potential.  I tried out your script but
    I've experienced problems connecting to the BB8, similar to the connection problems
    I've experienced using Cylon and the Javascript API.  How did you deal with the
    connection to Bluetooth LE?

  body: "Thanks. The BLE is definitely clunky... what I noticed is that if fails to\
    \ connect, I use the App from my phone to connect to BB8, then try again with\
    \ the API and it works fine. \n\nI wrote a 2nd part to that tutorial that you\

    \nHope that helps,\nPhilippe.\n-----"
