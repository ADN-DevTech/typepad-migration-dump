    \ service provided by SAP, so I would expect this service is not available anymore.\
    \ \n\nIn any case you will have to use your own SAP credentials if you want to\
    \ run the demo on your side. You will first need create an account on the SAP\
    \ developer center and then get the latest tools in order to use the Netweaver\
    \ technology:\n\nhttp://scn.sap.com/community/developer-center\n\n-----"
