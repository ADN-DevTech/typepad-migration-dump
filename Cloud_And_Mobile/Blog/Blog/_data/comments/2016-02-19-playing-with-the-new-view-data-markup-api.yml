  body: 'Hi Philippe,

    Thank you very much for this article.

    However I tried to use this script in my test app and I receive this error:


    "MarkupsCore.js:4259 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property ''call'' of undefined"

    in "MarkupTool()" function this line:

    Autodesk.Viewing.ToolInterface.call(this);


    any help will be appreciated.

    Regards,

    Afshin'
