  body: "Hi Tony,\n\nGood point. I was aware of the the XAMarin effort but I have\
    \ not used it so I am not sure of the coverage of the API or its performance compared\
    \ to the Dalvik system. Another important point in XAMarin's favor is that is\
    \ has an iOS flavor as well so potentially, you could have a single source base\
    \ for Android and iOS. \n\nCheers\nGopinath"
