  body: "Hey Philippe,\n\nThis really is ultra super cool.\n\nCongratulations!\n\n\
    Is it easy to identify sub-components within the model? \n\nAssociate data with\
    \ them?\n\nWould it theoretically be possible (or maybe even easy) to expand this\
    \ to simple editing operations?\n\nI assume this system would work just as well\
    \ on any device, including tablets and phones etc., providing the browser supports\
    \ WebGL?\n\nWhat browser with that functionality would you recommend for the iPad?\n\
    \nThank you!\n\nCheers, Jeremy."

  body: 'Yes identifying the components is easy and any data could be attached to
    them. The format used is the same than the one in the devdays viewer.


    The data displayed is a mesh, so editing would be quite challenging I guess...


    This will work with any browser supporting WebGL: http://caniuse.com/webgl'

  body: "Great! \n\nThank you.\n\nAnother question: where can I find a definition\
    \ of the JSON format you are using?\n\nI analysed the files you provided and see\
    \ the FacetCount, VertexCount, VertexCoords, VertexIndices, Normals, NormalIndices,\
    \ Center, Color and Id properties they define, and that all makes perfect sense.\n\
    \nStill, it would be nice to know exactly how those are defined and whether some\
    \ are optional before I go ahead and start implementing such an exporter for Revit...\
    \ :-)\n\nCheers and happy weekend to you!"

    great job ! How do you obtain the json file by an obj file or whatelse 3D format
    ?'

  body: "Hi,\nIn that example the json file was generated by some custom code. I used\
    \ the Inventor tessellation API CalculateFacets to get coordinates of the vertices,\
    \ then exported it in my own format to json using that lib: http://james.newtonking.com/projects/json-net.aspx\n\
