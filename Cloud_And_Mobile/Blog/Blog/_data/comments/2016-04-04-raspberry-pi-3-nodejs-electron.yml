  body: 'Hello,


    Thanks for your example! I tried it in my raspberry pi 3 but is not working. Annyang
    don''t work, it always shows:


    Speech Recognition is repeatedly stopping and starting. See http://is.gd/annyang_restarts
    for tips.


    I''m not using Speech Recognition in any other tab.


    In the console in debug mode, but I don''t have any other tab with the speech
    recognition.


    Do you have any idea?


    Thanks a lot!'

  body: 'Hello,


    Thanks for the code. I tried it and its giving me the same error as above. My
    usb mic is working fine. I think electron.js or any other app using chromium are
    not allowed to use the speech window speech. Can you please let me know if its
    there any work around'
