  body: "Hello Liang,\nI am wondering whether it is possible that the plugin can run\
    \ the clash detective tool and then read the clash data? Here we can see the clash\
    \ data are already there. What if I need to run the clash test first and then\
    \ read the clash data both from the API, without any user intervention? Is it\
    \ possible to make it dynamic? \nThank you very much.\n-----"
