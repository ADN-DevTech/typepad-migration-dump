<p><strong>Please help us identify things that bother you when you’re working in Maya that we can easily fix.</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://mayafeedback.autodesk.com/forums/160518-small-annoying-things-to-fix-in-maya-forum">http://mayafeedback.autodesk.com/forums/160518-small-annoying-things-to-fix-in-maya-forum</a>&#0160;</p>
<p>Suggest and vote for annoying little quirks or problems in Maya you want us to fix, and get others to vote for your ideas.<br /><br />Describe both the steps to show the issue, and how you would prefer it. Enter each idea separately (we’ll remove items with multiple ideas).<br /><br />Put larger issues in the <a href="http://mayaautodesk.uservoice.com/forums/160514-ideas-for-maya-forum">Ideas for Maya</a> forum. We’ll move issues that are not small (even if they are annoying) to this forum — if so, you’ll get your votes back.</p>
<p>There is a &quot;scripting and api&quot; category,&#0160;there you can&#0160;add your&#0160;small annoying things for the Python or C++ API :)</p>
<p>Enjoy,</p>
<p>Kristine</p>
