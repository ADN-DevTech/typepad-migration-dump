<p>Not that it is something really new as they&#39;ve been posted late December for most of them, but last week we posted all the public ones <a href="http://area.autodesk.com/au2012/adn" target="_self">on Area</a>. You may remember <a href="http://around-the-corner.typepad.com/adn/2012/06/adn-devdays-au-las-vegas-2012-call-for-proposals.html" target="_self">an invite</a> posted last June for people to present at the ADN conference. These videos are the one people who were accepted presented. Other recordings will remain accessible to <a href="http://www.autodesk.com/joinadn" target="_self">ADN members</a> only until May/June time as they contain confidential information on 3ds Max &amp; Maya, ... next releases.</p>
