<p>I’m up in the USA enjoying 3 weeks of hiking in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_national_parks_of_the_United_States" target="_self">National Parks</a>, and unfortunaly will not have any computer with me to play with programing. I&#39;ll start at <a href="http://www.nps.gov/yell/index.htm" target="_self">Yellowstone</a>&#0160;for a week, and will then go south through Zion, Bryce, Arches, Grand Canyon, and few others... The last time, I went to Zion and Bryce it was at my honeymoon trip 20 years ago. I should be back in August and post here again.</p>
