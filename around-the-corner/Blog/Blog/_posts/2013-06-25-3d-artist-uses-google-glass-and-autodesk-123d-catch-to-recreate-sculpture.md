<p>A friend forwarded me that article which is not only interesting reading because this is about new Autodesk technologies ;) - but it brings a real value in the design and the entertainment fields. I see this as a nice extension of the Kinect mesh / pointcloud capabilities but with more flexibility since you only need a camera.</p>

<p>Here&#0160;Todd Blatt was using 123dCatch, but you could get better results using the Autodesk&#0160;ReCap (currently in final Beta 3 phase).&#0160;The results you can get from ReCap Photo are generally much better that 123D Catch, which is completely logical, given the fact it’s a tool that’s targeted at the professional market which works with higher resolution imagery.</p>
<p>Here is a more detailed <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2013/06/comparing-123d-catch-with-recap-photo.html" target="_self">comparaison post</a> on both 123d catch and ReCap from my colleague and friend Kean.</p>
