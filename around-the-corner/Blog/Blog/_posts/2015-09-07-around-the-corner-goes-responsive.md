<p>It was time for &#39;Around the Corner&#39; &#0160;to receive a much-needed design refresh. I had hoped to get our internal creative team to help with this, but that unfortunately did not pan out: all issues that you come across are therefore the responsibility of yours truly.</p>
<ul>
<li>Here are the key changes in this refresh:</li>
<li>Based on Typepad’s “Snap” responsive design template</li>
<li>Switched to new fonts: Lato for titles and headings, Open Sans for body text</li>
</ul>
<p>Displays excerpts rather than full posts on the home page and post indices/archives The intention is that the blog be much more readable on a variety of devices and form factors. Based on the fact that a significant portion of you (35%) only expect to read this from large form factor devices (PCs), I definitely didn’t want to compromise that experience. I welcome your feedback – positive and negative – although I don’t expect to be able to please everyone with this redesign.</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
