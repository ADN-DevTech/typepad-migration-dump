<p>The highlight of Autodesk University for the ADN team every year is meeting you - developers using Autodesk technology - and talking about the amazing things you’re doing with Autodesk APIs. But sometimes it’s difficult to find you in the crowd. That is why, this year, we decided to turn the hunters into the hunted and award an iPad Mini prize to the three ADN partners who could track down the most members of the ADN team and post a photo with them on the AU Mobile App activity feed.</p>
<p>Competition was fierce, but three winners have emerged through the combination of their tracking ability and artistic merit for the photos they took.</p>
<p>So, without further ado … the winners are …</p>
<ul>
<li>Mark McLaughlin</li>
<li>Lawrence Dill</li>
<li>Rob Smith</li>
</ul>
<p>Congratulations to all three of you.</p>
