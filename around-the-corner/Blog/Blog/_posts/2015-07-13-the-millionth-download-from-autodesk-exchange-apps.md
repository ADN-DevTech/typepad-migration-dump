<p>Quite a milestone has just been passed: more than a million apps have now been downloaded from Autodesk Exchange. The store has been running for a little over three years and is apparently home to over 1,800 apps in 14 languages that are available for download in 191 countries. Wow. Be sure to check out Autodesk Exchange Apps for AutoCAD, the largest of our various stores.</p>

<p>A two-for-one! Another important milestones for Exchange is that we reach the 100 Maya apps posted on Exchange.</p>
