To install, you must uninstall your previous version of Maya 2017. </li> </ul>  <br />  <p>Big month, right? Within all these new versions, I really want to emphasize one amazing feature of Stingray 1.6, that’s the first ever SDK for Stingray engine plug-ins. </p>  <p>You can now write plug-ins for the Stingray engine in C without needing source code access! This greatly improves the ability for all customers to extend Stingray. You can hook the runtime engine into other third-party libraries and middleware SDKs, support your own custom data types, write your own gameplay code in C, and more. </p>  <p>The Stingray Platform SDK along with its documentation make it easier to use Stingray as development platform to build interactive and immersive experiences and tools. It allows users to integrate the Editor and/or the Runtime Engine with third-party libraries, applications, web services, or data sources. The sum of those plugins define the Editor workspace – per the picture below. The new SDK documentation along with the reference plugin examples will be shipping with both the binary and source versions of Stingray as of V1.6. Have a look at the full SDK docs <a href="http://help.autodesk.com/view/Stingray/ENU/?guid=__sdk_help_introduction_html">here</a>.&#160; </p>  <p>It’s a wonderful world for developers! </p> <b><b></b></b>  <p><a href="http://around-the-corner.typepad.com/.a/6a0163057a21c8970d01b7c8b7d392970b-pi"><img title="stingray" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin-left: auto; border-left: 0px; display: block; padding-right: 0px; margin-right: auto" border="0" alt="stingray" src="/assets/image_384fac.jpg" width="445" height="233" /></a></p>
