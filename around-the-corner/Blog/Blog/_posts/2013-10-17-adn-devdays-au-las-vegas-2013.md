an introduction to Oauth and RESTful API, and it is already time to think about AU
Las Vegas and the <a href="http://au.autodesk.com/las-vegas/pre-conference/adn-conference-devlab">ADN
Devdays</a>.</p>
<p>Once again, we will present the <a href="http://area.autodesk.com/cave2013/adn"><strong>ADN Developer Conference</strong></a> the day before AU where 3ds Max and Maya engineering
will introduce the new APIs in the upcoming releases. We will also have&#0160; eight industry lectures on making the best
use of various APIs such as PySide, Python, the new 3ds Max CPython API, and
more…</p>
<p>This year the conference is open
to ADN members only. If you are not an <a href="http://www.autodesk.com/joinadn">ADN member</a>
(or using ADN Open only) but are interested in attending, <a href="mailto:cyrille@autodesk.com" target="_self">talk to me</a>, and we
will find a way to get you in. You will need your ADN number to register.</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://around-the-corner.typepad.com/.a/6a0163057a21c8970d019b001889a6970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Unsure_smiley" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0163057a21c8970d019b001889a6970c" src="/assets/image_4e621a.jpg" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Unsure_smiley" /></a><br />If you are unsure if you should attend,
take a look at <a href="http://area.autodesk.com/au2012/adn">last year’s
lecture recordings</a>. They aren’t all posted, but they will give you a very
good idea of what it is all about. This year in particular would be a great
place to come as we have several M&amp;E engineering people coming to tackle
your questions/issues on almost all Autodesk products. Neil Hazzard (3ds Max)
and Jean-Philippe Grenier (Maya) from the rendering team will also be around to
talk in 1on1 meetings on the viewport / rendering challenges you may have. If
you want to talk to them, please let me know and I’ll arrange something for
you. I also invite you to contact me if you have any specific needs to talk to
anyone @autodesk and I’ll try to arrange it.</p>
