<p>My favourite mesh generation and manipulation tool, Autodesk Memento, is now available (in Beta) for the Mac. I’ve been part of the Alpha programme for the OS X version for some time: admittedly not very actively, but I did install a number of builds and report an error or two. I’m very happy to see the Mac version is now joining its Windows sibling in Beta. Both versions can be downloaded and installed from <a href="http://memento.autodesk.com/try-memento" target="_blank">this page</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://360.autodesk.com/Public/Details?hash=e005bb79f66448958069ebd32f53a6dc" target="_blank">The model</a> shown at the top of the page is of coral – I downloaded it from the bottom of the Memento download page – and others are available via <a href="https://memento.autodesk.com/projects/popular" target="_blank">the Memento gallery</a>. Be sure to check the gallery out (and help populate it with interesting meshes you capture).</p>
<p>If you’re interested in the use of Memento for capturing coral, I do recommend taking a look at <a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/05/3d-modeled-coral/" target="_blank">this Wired article</a> about <a href="http://thehydro.us/" target="_blank">The Hydrous</a>, a project that’s also been featured <a href="http://lineshapespace.com/reality-computing/" target="_blank">on Line//Shape//Space</a>. I also recommend watching this video of The Hydrous founder, Sly Lee, who talked about the project’s use of reality capture technology at a recent <a href="http://www.autodesk.com/gallery/design-nights" target="_blank">Design Night</a> at the <a href="http://www.autodesk.com/gallery/overview" target="_blank">Autodesk Gallery</a> in San Francisco:</p>

<p>A colleague from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuch%C3%A2tel" target="_blank">Neuchâtel</a> office, Cecilia Dobner, features in the video at the 15m30s mark. Cecilia’s an avid – and highly experienced – diver who volunteered to work with The Hydrous at a recent expedition in Bali. It’s been really interesting discussing the challenges around 3D construction of living, underwater organisms with her.</p>
