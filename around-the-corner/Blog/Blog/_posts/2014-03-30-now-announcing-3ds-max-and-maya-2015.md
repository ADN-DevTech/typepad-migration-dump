<p>I&#39;ve just arrived home from a 30-day trip to the Bay Area and Neuchatel. It was a really interesting trip – as usual – but I&#39;m happy to be home (even if I’m writing this on a Sunday morning, once again trying to catch up on many things you cannot really do while travelling).</p>
<p>The release happened really few days ago and&#0160;it seems timely for me to talk about the updates more from a developer’s perspective.&#0160;This year you will see lots of great new features, a ton of enhancements and user requested features and of course, more work to improve your core workflows.&#0160;</p>
<p>To learn about the details for please Visit...</p>
<p>3ds Max –&#0160;<a href="http://area.autodesk.com/3dsmax2015">http://area.autodesk.com/3dsmax2015</a></p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://around-the-corner.typepad.com/.a/6a0163057a21c8970d01a3fce29a37970b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Skull" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0163057a21c8970d01a3fce29a37970b img-responsive" src="/assets/image_0870c3.jpg" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Skull" /></a></p>
<p>A really important feature, from my perspective, is the enhancements to 3ds Max’s&#0160;<strong>point cloud</strong>&#0160;capabilities:&#0160;This is going to add serious value to the use of point clouds in 3ds Max, whether they come from laser scanners or devices such as the Kinect.</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://around-the-corner.typepad.com/.a/6a0163057a21c8970d01a3fce29a5d970b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Stereo" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0163057a21c8970d01a3fce29a5d970b img-responsive" src="/assets/image_6ca99c.jpg" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Stereo" /></a></p>
<p>The support for Stereo Cameras is also part of this release and you can download the additional module from the Autodesk Exchange Store</p>
<p>Another cool thing is the introduction of Python Scripting in 3ds Max. There isn&#39;t any embedded editor and the scripts have to be ran via MAXScript, but it is indeed a very nice 1st integration release for Python in the 3ds Max workflows.</p>
<p>and more...</p>
<p>Maya –&#0160;<a href="http://area.autodesk.com/maya2015">http://area.autodesk.com/maya2015</a></p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://around-the-corner.typepad.com/.a/6a0163057a21c8970d01a511924bc4970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Bifrost" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0163057a21c8970d01a511924bc4970c img-responsive" src="/assets/image_75a45b.jpg" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Bifrost" /></a><br />The major new feature for Maya is for me the introduction of Bifrost - the simulation engine / procedural effect platform. There isn&#39;t yet specific API to control Bifrost, but the MEL commands already give you a lot to be able to create cool effects.</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://around-the-corner.typepad.com/.a/6a0163057a21c8970d01a511925bcc970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Viewport20" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0163057a21c8970d01a511925bcc970c img-responsive" src="/assets/image_bdc96c.jpg" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Viewport20" /></a></p>
<p>The other major change in the release is that the Viewport 2.0 is now the default viewport for Maya. So in case you got custom nodes not working as well as it used to be, that may be due to that change. I would recommend that you update your vode as soon as possible since Maya may drop Viewport 1.0 support in a future release.</p>

<p>Maya LT -&#0160;<a href="http://area.autodesk.com/products/features/mayalt" target="_self">http://area.autodesk.com/products/features/mayalt</a></p>
<p>The Cloud integrations with Dropbox, Autodesk 360, and Autodesk 123D apps make it easier to share game assets with your team through the cloud. Maya LT 2015 now lets you browse and open files in certain cloud services directly through the Maya LT interface, making it easier to import 3D assets. Built-in access to Dropbox and Autodesk 360 let you open, modify, and save files back to the cloud. Using the Autodesk 123D cloud storage service, you can now also grab models created in 123D Catch or 123D Creature and use them as a starting point to make your game assets.</p>
