<p>Again my apologizes for the long silence, but I was involved in finishing a project to be shown @ AU and because our ADN Devdays tour starts this week, I had to work extra hours and week-end to polish the application. Anyway, back to normal, I should write post regularly again :)</p>
<p>For this first post, I&#39;d like to highligh <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2013/11/3d-printing-tech-previews-on-autodesk-labs-projects-miller-and-shapeshifter.html" target="_self">this post from Kean Walmsley</a>. I was in Tel Aviv to work on AutoCAD 360 back in August and chat with that team about what they were doing. It is a very nice technology and interesting topic, but for games and animation, 3d priting is probably not the first topic of interest? but eveytime, I visit a studio I see figurines, 3d models, etc.. everywhere</p>
<p>I also read this <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/claytonmitchell/monstermatic-the-first-3d-printing-game" target="_self">post</a> recently which shows a young team working on a mobile app to desgin / print monsters.</p>
