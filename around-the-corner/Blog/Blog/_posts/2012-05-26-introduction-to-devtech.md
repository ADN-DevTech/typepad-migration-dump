<p>I&#39;m very pleased to be part of a great team at Autodesk: the M&amp;E Developer Technical Services team (DevTech M&amp;E), whose focus is on providing high quality services to members of the Autodesk Developer Network (ADN Sparks). Aside from providing technical support for programming-related questions, we also write technical solutions, present at technical conferences like GDC, AU, ... , provide API training and mentoring (a specific type of short-term consulting), and liaise regularly with our Engineering teams.</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://around-the-corner.typepad.com/.a/6a0163057a21c8970d0163064dcb8b970d-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Devtech" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0163057a21c8970d0163064dcb8b970d" src="/assets/image_e26453.jpg" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Devtech" /></a><br />The team is spread around the world: (from left to right) Kristine Middlemiss and Naiqi Weng are based in Toronto (Canada), Kevin Vandecar is based in Manchester (USA), and Akira Kudo based in Tokyo (Japan). Everyone in the team is a programming expert focusing on multiple products and wearing many hats… We believe very strongly that providing hands-on support is a great way to develop strong technical skills that are of use in other parts of our job, so everyone in the team (managers included) is involved in answering questions from our ADN members.</p>
<p>The team currently covers most of the spectrum of Autodesk products exposing APIs. Support for non Media &amp; Entertainment products is handled by another team within the company, but we share tools (such as our web-based case-submission front-end) and processes.</p>
<p>You’ll hopefully get to know members of DevTech M&amp;E as time goes on – I’ll be using this blog to showcase their work, sharing some of the tips and techniques they use (and discover) as part of their respective jobs.</p>
