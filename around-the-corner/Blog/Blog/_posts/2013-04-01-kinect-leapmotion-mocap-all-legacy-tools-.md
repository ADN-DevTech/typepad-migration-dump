<p>On January 2011, Microsoft came out with a revolutionary device named <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/kinectforwindows/" target="_self">Kinect</a>. While Microsoft made it for their&#0160;Xbox, many people used the Kinect to give computers eyes, ears, and the capacity to interact naturally with people by simply gesturing and speaking.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 10px; padding-left: 30px;">&#0160;</p>
<p>A lot of developers were really enthusiast to deliver new tools despite the limitation of that device in terms of speed and accuracy. However seeing the unexpected success and adoption by both developers and consumers. Microsoft decided to make a second version which can work better on computer and be used in a professional environment.</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p><img alt="Leapmotion" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0163057a21c8970d017c38046775970b" src="/assets/image_f234d0.jpg" style="float: right; margin-left: 10px;" title="Leapmotion" /></p>
<p>Shortly after <a href="https://www.leapmotion.com/" target="_self">LeapMotion</a>&#0160;announced the avaibility of a compelling device dedicated to gesture - an area the Kinect could not directly do with good results. Both devices opened a complete new world of possibilities for gaming, working, and more.</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p><img alt="LeapDJ" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0163057a21c8970d017c380479e8970b" src="/assets/image_205fa1.jpg" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" title="LeapDJ" /></p>
<p>&#0160;And nowadays with tablets we have also gesture on screen and can work anywhere we want without losing connection to our friends, community, and our data.</p>
<p>I still cannot believe we could even work differently before.</p>

<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://around-the-corner.typepad.com/.a/6a0163057a21c8970d017c3804a105970b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Smartglass" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0163057a21c8970d017c3804a105970b" src="/assets/image_cfb2f9.jpg" style="float: right;" title="Smartglass" /></a><br /><br /></p>
<p>And now <a href="http://www.google.com/glass/start/what-it-does/" target="_self">Google Glass</a>, <a href="http://www.vuzix.com/home/" target="_self">Vuzix with their Smart phone hand-free device</a> and few others who are announcing augmented reality sometimes in 3d, I thought we were going to a &#39;limited&#39; interactive world where real and virtual mix all together.</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>USA was definitively driving the innovation in that field&#0160;<strong>until today</strong>!</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://around-the-corner.typepad.com/.a/6a0163057a21c8970d017c3804b69f970b-pi" style="display: inline;"></a><br /><strong>Facing the Hard Truths.</strong></p>
<p>A Russian company has just announced a new device based on the secret
Russian research from the&#0160;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War" target="_self">cold war</a>&#0160;they had access to.</p>
<p>They introduced a revolutionary personal interface for human computer interaction reading your brain - But also interact with your brain to send imagery. No more needs of capture motion device, it reads what you want from your brain - no more keyboard, mouse, it detects what you want - no more screen, you don&#39;t see an images anymore, it is there in 3D.</p>

<p><img alt="Epoc" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0163057a21c8970d017c3804b69f970b" src="/assets/image_5d1f7d.jpg" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Epoc" /></p>
<p>All this to tell you I lost couple of months of my life doing research on using &amp; programing these legacy devices like in my Kinect articles (<a href="http://around-the-corner.typepad.com/adn/2013/02/initial-fooling-around-with-kinect-and-maya.html" target="_self">Part 1</a>,&#0160;<a href="http://around-the-corner.typepad.com/adn/2013/02/using-the-microsoft-kinect-sdk-to-bring-a-basic-point-cloud-into-maya.html" target="_self">Part 2</a>) because they already all legacy devices now :(</p>
<p>Anyway,
I was really excited by all this until my boss came to me to say I had to
rewrite the complete Maya UI again- You can pre-order the device <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_Fools&#39;_Day" target="_self">here</a>.</p>
