<p>Another month, another plugin. :-)</p>
<p>As&#0160;<a href="http://labs.blogs.com/its_alive_in_the_lab/2012/11/free-november-adn-plugin-of-the-month-mashnodes-for-maya.html" target="_blank">announced over on Scott’s blog</a>&#0160;a few days ago, the latest&#0160;<a href="http://labs.autodesk.com/utilities/ADN_plugins/" target="_blank">Plugin of the Month</a>&#0160;is now live. </p>
<p>MASH is a suite of Maya nodes, developed in-house at Mainframe, aimed at enabling their artists to create versatile &#39;motion design&#39; style animations. It offers a selection of effector nodes which can be daisy-chained together to generate a wide variety of customizable effects. It&#39;s fully controllable from both Maya&#39;s Attribute and Node Editors.</p>
<p>MASH has been tested in Maya 2013 on both Mac and PC; however, it should work on all Maya versions back to 2010. The source code has been provided as Python source code available in the plug-ins folder after install. The &#39;Waiter&#39; is the crux of MASH. It&#39;s a selection set, objects you drag onto the Waiter will be effected by the MASH network. The Waiters Attribute Editor is also the place to create nodes for the network, set the initial state for any objects and there&#39;s also a helper button to hook MASH up to a Maya instancer.</p>
<p>Thanks to <strong>Chris Hardcastle&#0160;</strong>and <strong>Ian&#0160;Waters</strong>&#0160;from Mainframe North Ltd who shared their plug-ins and code.</p>
