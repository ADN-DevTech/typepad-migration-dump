<p>With Kristine we found interesting that Canadian, Americans, and French have all their national day early July. I know different reasons, but still...</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://around-the-corner.typepad.com/.a/6a0163057a21c8970d01774314db88970d-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Bastille-day" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0163057a21c8970d01774314db88970d" src="/assets/image_df7eb6.jpg" style="float: right;" title="Bastille-day" /></a><br />&#39;Bastille Day&#39; is the name given in English-speaking countries to the French National Day, which is celebrated on the 14th of July each year. In France, it is formally called &#39;La Fête Nationale&#39; (The National Celebration) and commonly le quatorze juillet (the fourteenth of July). It commemorates the the anniversary of the storming of the Bastille on 14 July 1789; the anniversary of the storming of the Bastille fortress-prison was seen as a symbol of the uprising of the modern nation, and of the reconciliation of all the French inside the constitutional monarchy which preceded the First Republic, during the French Revolution.</p>
<p>That&#39;s what history says... The truth is that there was only 2 or 3 murderers/thieves in that prison at that time, but the Bastille was also the main armory inside the city and the true reason why it falls.</p>
<p>Festivities and official ceremonies are held all over France and usually starts on July 13th which is a Friday this year which is why I am not working today ;)</p>
