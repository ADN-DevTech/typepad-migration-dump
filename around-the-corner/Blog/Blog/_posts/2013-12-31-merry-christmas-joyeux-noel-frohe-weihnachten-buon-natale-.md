<p>and a Happy new year, Bonne année, Frohes Jahr,&#0160;buen año,&#0160;豐年</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>I am in the middle of an extended break with my family, so it&#39;s time for me to sign off and wish you all a very Merry Christmas (or Happy Holidays for those of you that are non-denominational in your festive activities) and the very best for 2014.</p>

<p>Yesterday, I spent my day playing with my brother &amp; sister&#39; kids at Warcraft III. Myself and a friend against 9 kids from 8 to 17. They won the first round :S because we did not wanted to kill one of them after 5 minutes playing - but we should had - Anyway we won the last 3 other games, but the last one was really hard.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll be back online on January 6th (unless I end up having trouble keeping away from the computer :-)</p>
