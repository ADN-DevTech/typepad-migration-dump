<p><br /><em>AU is right around the corner (it&#39;s just so hard to believe!).&#0160;</em></p>
<p><em></em>This week is the last week before&#0160;<a href="http://au.autodesk.com/">Autodesk University</a>. Thousands are heading for Las Vegas during the week end and we will be ready for them with great speakers, classes, technology, Innovation forums, vendors,&#0160;<a href="http://www.augi.com/">AUGI</a>&#0160;Annual meeting, entertainment and more.</p>
<p> The ADN Developer Days on the Monday before AU will also be a great place to be to hear about what&#39;s coming next.</p>
<p>In this final week before AU, I am head down for my sessions and events by trying to avoid email to prevent distraction. I said trying... it is really hard to not do anything alike nowadays ;)</p>
<p>Each AU event is unique and I can’t wait to experience&#0160;<a href="http://au.autodesk.com/">AU 2012</a>, and then directly afterwards get some well needed rest and recovery, before doing an APC tour and deliver again these talk in Shanghai, Beijing and Tokyo. Returning home the day before Christmas :S</p>
<p>Hope to see you at AU!</p>
