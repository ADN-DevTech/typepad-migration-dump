<p>I arrived safely in Las Vegas for AU2012 and finally done with the ADN M&amp;E DevDays conference. It was a lot of work to prepare and even more to deliver. But we had great success, and wonderful deep technical presentations delivered by Autodesk engineers, and external people from multiple Studios on concrete solutions and/or challenges. All presentations where good, but I wanted to highlight here to of them:</p>
<h2>Let&#39;s start by the OpenSubdiv presentation</h2>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://around-the-corner.typepad.com/.a/6a0163057a21c8970d017ee5b48bbf970d-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Opensubdiv" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0163057a21c8970d017ee5b48bbf970d" src="/assets/image_eede65.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 4px;" title="Opensubdiv" /></a>Let&#39;s start by the OpenSubdiv presentation made by the Pixar GPU team. It was simply awesome!</p>
<p>Not only the demo were cool and effective by showing how it is working and how things work. But the team took the time to explain in details the internal structure, how to use it in your own application, and talk about their roadmap in improving things... What is also important to know is that it is an open source development project hosted on github. So anyone can contribute to make it even better. Please visit <a href="http://graphics.pixar.com/opensubdiv" target="_self">http://graphics.pixar.com/opensubdiv</a> for more information on this. Finally, I really want to thanks the Pixar GPU team to have given a stop in the ADN M&amp;E conference on their way to Siggraph APAC.</p>
<h2><strong>Next is Profiling vs Debugging</strong></h2>
<p>Ravi Jagannadhan from our consulting team here at Autodesk, made a very good presentation on profiling on how someone can improve Maya performance by spending a reasonable amount of time on profiling Maya. But my learnings here were that instead of talking about profiling C++ in Maya. Ravi get into the details on profiling everything else in Maya but C++. I learned that not only I can run profiling on MEL code, but the Maya DG itself. Why that? Well, we immediately had someone during Devlab which had an issue on performance in the DG, and with Ravi help we identified fairly easy what it was. I need to spend more time on this and practice myself. But I am pretty sure I&#39;ll write something on this in the next couple of weeks.</p>
<h2>Ooops! did I miss anything</h2>
<p>There was 12 other tracks on various subject such as references, OPENData, <a href="http://www.mixamo.com/" target="_self">Animation Store from Mixamo</a>, etc... So you definitely wanted to attend,</p>
<p>But I got a good and bad news for you! the good first, everything was recorded :) but not everything can be shared to public since some presentations contain confidential information. So the good and bad news is that more than half of the presentations will be posted within few weeks on the Autodesk AREA portal - <a href="http://area.autodesk.com/au2012/adn" target="_self">http://area.autodesk.com</a>, and some other with restricted access onto the ADN Sparks portal - <a href="http://adnsparks.autodesk.com" target="_self">http://adnsparks.autodesk.com</a>.&#0160;</p>
<h3>Not over...</h3>
<p>Wish me luck (and to Kevin as well), we both do our AU presentation today.</p>
