<p>Okay, let me re-phrase that, “All Things Qt….and Maya” :)</p>
<p>In the past couple of years I have been getting more and  more interested and into Qt, why you ask? Because it’s fun to develop things  that are visual! I am what you would call a “Visual Learner” if I can see it or  picture it with my mind’s eye, and then I will understand it a lot quicker! And  reason two; there are Python wrappers for Qt!!! (Need I say more ;)…? But  seriously, they make it pretty easy to create custom UI, and who doesn’t like  easy!</p>
<p>(I am having a bit of picture envy from Cyrille’s post so I  will try to spice mine up a bit)</p>
<p>First I am going to pimp myself out, and go over my  resources that hopefully you will find helpful and education on how to tackle  Qt in Maya.</p>
