The winners had a good VR solution based on WebGL for viewing, 2 smart phones to create a stereo camera. That was neat...</p>
<p>Once again, we will present the <a href="http://area.autodesk.com/au2014/adn" target="_self"><strong>ADN Developer Conference</strong></a>&#0160;- <a href="http://autodeskdevdays.com/devdays-me-2014/" target="_self">DevDays</a> on December 1<sup>st</sup> (the day before <a href="http://area.autodesk.com/au2014" target="_self">AU</a>) where 3ds Max and Maya engineering will introduce the new APIs in the upcoming releases and DevHack, a drop-in programming workshop on December 2<sup>nd</sup>. We will also have a few industry lectures on making the best use of various APIs such as PySide, Python, the new 3ds Max CPython API, and more…</p>
<p>This year the conference is open to anyone. If you are not an ADN member and are interested in attending <a href="mailto:cyrille.fauvel@autodesk.com" target="_self">just talk to me</a> so that we can help you with the special ID and NDA required to register.</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://around-the-corner.typepad.com/.a/6a0163057a21c8970d019b001889a6970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Unsure_smiley" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0163057a21c8970d019b001889a6970c" src="/assets/image_4e621a.jpg" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Unsure_smiley" /></a><br />If you are unsure if you should attend, take a look at <a href="http://area.autodesk.com/au2012/adn">2012’s lecture recordings</a>. They aren’t all posted, but they will give you a very good idea of what DevDays is all about. This year in particular would be a great time and place to come as we have several M&amp;E engineering people coming to tackle your questions/issues on almost all Autodesk products. We’re also available at DevHack for a whole afternoon on December 2<sup>nd</sup> from 1:00 p.m. – 5:30 p.m. I also invite you to contact me if you have any specific needs to talk to anyone @autodesk and I’ll try to arrange it.</p>

<p><strong>DevHack</strong> - Tuesday Dec 2<sup>nd</sup> - 1:00 p.m. - 5:30 p.m.</p>
<p>DevHack is a drop in workshop – you are invited to come and spend any part of the day. Bring your laptop and ask about, or work on, any problems with advice from DevTech engineers and API experts from Autodesk. Mingle with your fellow DevHackers. Perhaps you need some general design advice; or you’d like some guidance on implementing a specific algorithm. Or, you may want to spend some quality time learning to take advantage of the new cloud and/or mobile APIs you’ll learn about at DevDay. You could also get help publishing your app on Autodesk Exchange Apps. Anything goes – come for an hour or stay all day. We look forward to seeing you.</p>
