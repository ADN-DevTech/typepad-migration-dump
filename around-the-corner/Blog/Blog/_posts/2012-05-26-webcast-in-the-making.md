While the Maya Python training as been delivered already (and recorded - see my previous post), there is more coming:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>MotionBuilder/OpenReality SDK (Python/C++)<br /> starting on May 29th 2012 - 1 hour per day during 9 days</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>3ds Max SDK (C++)<br /> starting on July 16th 2012 for English - 1 hour per day during 10 days<br /> July 30th 2012 for Japanese - 1 hour per day during 10 days</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>FBX (C++)++)<br /> starting on June 18th 2012 for English - 1 hour per day during 5 days<br /> September 3rd 2012 for Japanese - 1 hour per day during 5 days</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Note these trainings are best to be attended to get a better experience and be able to ask questions to our API expert delivering the training. But they will be recorded and posted on the developer pages on Autodesk.com few weeks after the end.</p>
