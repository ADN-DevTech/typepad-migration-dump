<p>Back from vacation, ..., and a tons of emails to process :(</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://around-the-corner.typepad.com/.a/6a0163057a21c8970d01901eafd814970b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Email-help" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0163057a21c8970d01901eafd814970b" src="/assets/image_036fdd.jpg" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Email-help" /></a>But I can see a light that is coming to an end. If you tried to contact me and not yet received an answer, please ping me again.</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>Anyway I am pleased to announce that after many years we decided to publish our API training material as we will continue to maintain it in future. The video recordings are already published here:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.autodesk.com/developmaya" target="_self">for Maya</a>,</li>
<li><a href="http://www.autodesk.com/develop3dsmax" target="_self">for 3ds Max</a>,</li>
<li><a href="http://www.autodesk.com/developmotionbuilder" target="_self">for MotionBuilder</a>,</li>
<li><a href="http://www.autodesk.com/developfbx" target="_self">for FBX</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p> But we now also publish the material itself on github, <a href="https://github.com/ADN-DevTech/Maya-Training-Material" target="_self">here</a>. For everyone pleasure, we did upload the legacy training material as well, so in theory you can get the material for Maya 8.5 to Maya 2013+ from GitHub <a href="https://github.com/ADN-DevTech/Maya-Training-Material/releases" target="_self">History</a> panel.</p>
<p>If you find any issue, or have comment, please let me know,</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
