<p>For something completely different than usual, here is an interesting graphical representation of the organisational changes Autodesk has been through in the last couple of years.</p>
<p>The OrgOrgChart (Organic Organization Chart) project looks at the evolution of a company structure over time. A snapshot of the Autodesk organizational hierarchy was taken each day between May 2007 and June 2011:</p>

This representation is reminiscent of the Disk Tree visualization technique developed at Xerox Parc (Chi E.H., S.K. Card, 1999,&nbsp;<a href="http://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~echi/papers/infovis99/chi-wavs.pdf">Sensemaking of Evolving Web Sites Using Visualization Spreadsheets</a>,&nbsp;<em>Proceedings of the Symposium on Information Visualization (InfoVis '99)</em>, pp. 18-25), showing implicit and explicit affinities among information items and revealing relationships that are difficult to discover in traditional representations. Proximity or connections between items can reveal complex relationships in a comprehensive way, provide visual access to data structures, and enable detection of tendencies or patterns in the process.</p>
