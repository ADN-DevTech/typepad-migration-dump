<p>This is a quick update for Maya 2018 Devkit since our partners are asking about this. I am sorry for the late, but the Maya 2018 Devkit is available on our <a href="https://adn.autodesk.io/index.php">ADN extranet</a> now, if you are ADN member, you can download it <a href="https://adn.autodesk.io/index.php?r=custom_pages%2Fview&amp;id=130">there</a> directly. We are also working on to upload it to <a href="https://apps.autodesk.com">Autodesk App Store</a> and <a href="http://autodesk.com/developmaya">Maya Developer Center</a>, I will update the progress here.</p>
