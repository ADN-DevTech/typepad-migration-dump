<p>It’s a great opportunity to meet with my team members again who are located in different countries, and I also met many engineers in the Maya, FBX and 3ds Max team. It has been really exciting.</p>
<p>The new release of Maya 2016 version was announced on 16th April and everything is open to public now. I cannot wait to share the exciting API changes/improvement for Maya 2016.</p>
<p>The first thing you need to know is that devkit is not a part of Maya installation anymore. It’s now available online at <a href="https://apps.exchange.autodesk.com/MAYA/en/Detail/Index?id=appstore.exchange.autodesk.com:autodeskmaya2016developerkit_windows64:en" target="_blank">Autodesk Exchange</a>, and it will be maintained and updated on exchange store and <a href="http://www.autodesk.com/developmaya" target="_blank">Maya develop center</a> in the future. If you want to download that, please make sure you select the correct platform.</p>
<p>There are also some big changes for Maya 2016 API. If you are working on the rendering side, now Maya provides you powerful rendering python APIs, and together with some python script samples for your reference. Additionally there are also lots of improvements on rendering side for Maya 2016, you can check the details in “<a href="http://help.autodesk.com/view/MAYAUL/2016/ENU/?guid=__files_GUID_6644CF46_6648_45B8_A3D8_76EDD7712571_htm" target="_blank">What’s new/what’s changed</a>” section of the online SDK help.</p>
<p>Animation is another big change of Maya 2016 API and introduces evaluation manager to support multithreaded evaluation, also, it provides the support of GPU override to deformers by MPxGPUDeformer. You can refer to some samples like offsetNode and identityNode in the devkit.</p>
<p>There are a lot of other improvements for Maya 2016 API. Please check the link <a href="http://help.autodesk.com/view/MAYAUL/2016/ENU/?guid=__files_GUID_6644CF46_6648_45B8_A3D8_76EDD7712571_htm" target="_blank">here</a> and play with the new samples, and enjoy your work ;).</p>
<p>For MotionBuilder 2016, there is not as much change as Maya 2016, but we still have some improvement. Please visit <a href="http://www.autodesk.com/motionbuilder-sdkdoc-2016-enu" target="_blank">here</a> for the changes in detail.</p>
