<p>This is less an announcement of something we’re doing than it is a call for input (or perhaps a cry for help? ;-).</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://around-the-corner.typepad.com/.a/6a0163057a21c8970d017c31a92646970b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Plugin-of-the-month" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0163057a21c8970d017c31a92646970b" src="/assets/image_eace7d.jpg" style="width: 250px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Plugin-of-the-month" /></a></p>
<p>For the last 3 months, we started posting plug-ins on&#0160;<a href="http://labs.autodesk.com/">Autodesk Labs</a>&#0160;containing a “plug-in of the month, brought to you by the Autodesk Developer Network”. The plug-ins we’re providing will be simple productivity enhancing tools and utilities that streamline the use of one of our products.</p>
<p>The drivers behind this are to a) solve customer problems and b) demonstrate the benefits of investing in software customization. All the plug-ins we provide – with full source code, to show what goes on inside – will have taken a relatively small amount of time to develop (from half a day up to about a week), the idea being that nothing we deliver will be especially “out-of-reach” for someone wishing to invest in learning and using our APIs.</p>
<p>We already have a few plug-ins posted for M&amp;E:</p>
<ul>

</ul>

<p>To help drive this forward, I’d really like to hear from this blog’s readership:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are there annoying issues you would like to see addressed (whether in an Autodesk product or via a simple utility)?</li>
<li>Do you have your own simple utility you would like you make available as a “plug-in of the month”?</li>
</ul>
<p>Regarding the second question: we’re encouraging people outside my team to provide plug-ins through this initiative, bringing attention to their development skills (as mentioned earlier we will – as a requirement – be making the source-code available for these plug-ins). We will, of course, be giving clear credit – on the website and in the plug-in’s ReadMe – to the person who developed and provided a particular plug-in.</p>
<p>If you have a topic for a plug-in you’d like to see my team develop or you have your own you’d like to make available as a “plugin of the month” on Autodesk Labs, please&#0160;<a href="mailto:cyrille.fauvel@autodesk.com" target="_self">send me an email</a>.</p>
