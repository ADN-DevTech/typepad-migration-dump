<p>The Autodesk University Call for Proposals will close on May 26<sup>th</sup>, so there's still time to submit a proposal and get free entry to AU.</p>
<p>My colleague, Stephen Preston, being the track lead for the 'Developer' track, is particularly interested in persuading you to submit a proposal for a class or lab on an API/programming topic. Your proposal could be on an Autodesk API, but we also like to include a few classes/labs each year on general programming topics (programming languages, web/mobile/desktop programming, testing, debugging, application design, etc, etc).</p>
