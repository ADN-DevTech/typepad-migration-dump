<p>Well, so far, so good! We had a great ADN session on Monday, before AU proper kicked off yesterday. Lots of opportunities to talk with old friends and new. It’s always fun to find out what people are doing with our technology and hopefully to help address some of the snags they’ve hit along the way. The only downside for me is that the attendance wasn&#39;t as high as last year ;) something I need to work on because I feel that is a great opertunity for developers to talk about API with the people implementing the API. I&#39;ll follow-up with people comments and quotes in a future post. We got a lot of things like:</p>

<p>And &#39;you&#39; here means people behind the ADN program (Kevin, Naiqi, Zhong, Vijaya, Fenton, Gopi, Adam, Philippe, Jeremy, Stephen, Validimir, Sandeep, ...)</p>
<p>Anyway we had very good technical content delivered that we again recorded and we will make the public content available on AREA in the next few weeks. Checkout AREA at http://www.autodesk.com/adn2013</p>
<p>Yesterday started with Fred Chapman’s &quot;Dynamic Anatomy for 3D Artists&quot; session, which showed some great techniques for skin/muscle/bone animation system. I am sure the rest of AU will also be lots of good session while I am going to present Cloud and Mobile programming techniques and how to consume or create Cloud services in different envionments. End of the week, I&#39;ll be travelling back to Europe, before starting on Monday our EMEA DevDays tour. I can tell, I am looking forward to our annual Christmas break ;)</p>
