<p>Still on the road for the annual ADN M&amp;E devdays and sitting in the back of the room now I delivered the introduction presentation on &#39;why&#39; the cloud for M&amp;E is now important to our industry. Yesterday, I had the please and great surprise to see the whole ADN China team present in Shanghai who came for the AU China event, and we had a &#39;team&#39; dinner altogether finally, enjoying Shanghai specialties... You don&#39;t like Tofu much? you should try the spicy tofu preparation I had last night. I really enjoyed it ;)</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 8pt;">From left to right - Xiaodong, Zhong (M&amp;E), Xianhua (ADN China Manager), Joe (Devtech China Manager), myself, and Daniel</span></p>
<p>Now, as I cannot really understand what my Chinese colleagues talk about (I do not speak, nor read Chinese unfortunately for me), I&#39;ll probably write couple of posts before the Christmas holidays starts...</p>
