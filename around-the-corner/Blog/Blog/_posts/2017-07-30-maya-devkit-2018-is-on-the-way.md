<p>This is a short update regarding the Maya 2018 devkit.&#160; As-is typical for the devkit, it can take a few days to get it posted after our Maya product release. We are awaiting the official release from engineering and they have told us it should be ready in the next few days. Once we receive it, we will get it posted ASAP. Please check back here for the latest information. Thank you for your patience.</p>
