If you haven&#39;t registered yet and going to AU, please give a stop to our classes, I promiss you&#39;ll not be disapointed. But for this you also need to register to these classes.</p>
<p>There’s more detail on the class timing &amp; description here:</p>

<ul>
<li>Wednesday, Nov 28, 10:00 AM - 11:30 AM</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Kevin Vandecar</strong>, for the ADN M&amp;E team will also be presenting in this class:</p>

<ul>
<li>Wednesday, Nov 28, 3:00 PM - 4:30 PM</li>

<p>I&#39;ll be busy as well in assisting my other ADN colleagues in their class and round table. The AU promises to be very busy for me, but interesting too :)</p>
<p>On the Monday prior to AU starting, I’ll be running/presenting&#0160;<a href="http://au.autodesk.com/?nd=m_e_adn_conference_devlab&amp;und=1785" target="_blank">the ADN M&amp;E conference at AU</a>&#0160;for the second time.
