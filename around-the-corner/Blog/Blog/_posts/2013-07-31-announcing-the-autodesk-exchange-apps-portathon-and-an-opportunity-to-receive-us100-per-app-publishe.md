<p>We are excited to announce the inaugural Autodesk<sup>®</sup>&#0160;Exchange Apps Portathon – a 48 hour virtual web based coding “festival”. The Exchange Apps Portathon is a community event where you’ll have the opportunity to work closely with Autodesk engineers in real time and meet hundreds of other Autodesk software partners from around the world. It is all designed to help you get your apps ready and published on Autodesk Exchange Apps.</p>
<p>The Portathon will run for 48 hours, starting from 12:00 a.m. U.S. Pacific Time (PT) on Friday, September 13, 2013 and finishing by 11:59 p.m. PT on September 14, 2013. You can participate from anywhere you have internet access. If you’ve been thinking about publishing apps in the Exchange Apps store but haven’t found the time then this event will give you the help you need in real time to get them “out the door” and start driving the app sales and downloads that bring you or your company great new customers.</p>
<p>There’s no cost to join the Portathon, but there is a reward. For all new apps submitted to the Autodesk Exchange Apps store by midnight on September 14, 2013 and accepted for publication in the store by October 31, 2013, you will receive US$ 100 per app (for up to 5 apps – US$ 500 total).</p>
