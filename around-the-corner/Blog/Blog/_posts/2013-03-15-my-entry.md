<p>If you override the Python sys.excepthook, it doesn&#39;t seem to get called on uncaught exceptions in Maya.</p>
<p>This is because it is not possible to override sys.excepthook directly as Maya already does that internally. However, since Maya 2011, there is a solution which will allow you to add your own exception hook. To perform an action when an exception occurs without modifying Maya&#39;s default printing of exceptions, do the following:
</p>
<pre class="brush: python; toolbar: false;">import maya.utils

def myExceptCB(etype, value, tb, detail=2):

    # do something here...

    print &quot;do something here...&quot;

    return maya.utils._formatGuiException(etype, value, tb, detail)

maya.utils.formatGuiException = myExceptCB
</pre>
<p>For older Maya releases, you would have to hack the file &#39;python.py&#39; in the Maya installation. There is a function &#39;formatException&#39; that you could change to do something when an exception happens.</p>
