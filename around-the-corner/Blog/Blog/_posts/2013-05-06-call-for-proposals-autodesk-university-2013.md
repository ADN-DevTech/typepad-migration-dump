<p>As many of you will now be aware,&#0160;<a href="http://au.autodesk.com/?nd=call_for_proposals" target="_blank">the call for proposals for AU 2013 is now open</a>&#0160;and will remain so until May 19th. It’s always great to have people presenting fresh ideas at the conference, so think about whether you have something to share with fellow Autodesk customers/partners/developers and submit a proposal or two!</p>
<p>I&#39;ll follow-up in a few weeks with another call for presentation but for our ADN DevDays which will run just before AU (December 2nd) - you can see recording from last year <a href="http://area.autodesk.com/au2012/adn" target="_self">here</a>. If you come back in a few days on that link, you will be able to see more presentations than what was available until now.</p>
