<p><a href="http://labs.autodesk.com/technologies/khan" target="_self">Project Khan</a> is an experimental 3D asset optimization service running on the Autodesk 360 cloud that uses the popular game pipeline technology, Simplygon, from Donya Labs.</p>
<p>Autodesk has partnered with <a href="http://www.simplygon.com/">Donya Labs AB</a> to prototype a cloud-based optimization service (Project Khan) designed to automate LOD (level-of-detail) creation for 3D assets. LOD creation is critical to ensuring run-time performance of 3D assets and is frequently used in game and animation workflows to improve performance in complex scenarios.&#0160;</p>
<p>The service uses Donya Labs’ Simplygon which provides high quality LOD creation capabilities to game developers working on high-end titles. The goal of Project Khan, by making the technology more readily available, is to test whether there is more widespread interest in the 3D animation industry for such asset optimization services.</p>
<p>To determine whether there is a demand for such services, we are providing free access to Project Khan until February 28<sup>th</sup> 2014. Initially, it can be accessed via an Autodesk Maya 2014 plug-in, however, Autodesk is also researching a more general deployment of the service for users of its 3D animation portfolio including Autodesk 3ds Max, Maya and Maya LT users.</p>
<p>Project Khan gives users the ability to selectively simplify 3D assets by generating proxy assets and by reducing:&#0160;</p>
<ul>
<li>Mesh complexity</li>
<li>Texture complexity</li>
<li>Rig (bone) complexity</li>
</ul>
<p>With Project Khan, any user can configure an optimization job, securely execute that job on the Autodesk 360 cloud, and then immediately download the optimized asset into their Maya scene. Multiple optimization jobs can even be run to generate different LOD versions of the same asset. The workflow also includes the ability to preview assets, tweak the generation recipe, then optimize and download the assets.</p>
