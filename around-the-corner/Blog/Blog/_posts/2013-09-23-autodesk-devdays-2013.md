<p>DevDays is a great way to get a sense of what technology is coming from Autodesk, something that’s valuable even for Autodesk employees: the ADN team does a great job of synthesising what’s coming from our various product groups – a challenging task for lots of reasons (the timing of the event relative to development schedules, the volume of information to summarise and present within a limited amount of time, the difficulty of creating demo apps on pre-Alpha software, etc...).</p>
<p>Here’s some information on this year’s tour –</p>
