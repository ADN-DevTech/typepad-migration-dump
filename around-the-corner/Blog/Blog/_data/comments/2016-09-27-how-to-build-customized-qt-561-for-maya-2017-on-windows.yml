  body: 'Thank you for these instructions! I''m getting stuck on the OpenSSL compile.


    I added PATH variables:


    nmake: "/cygdrive/c/Program Files (x86)/Microsoft Visual Studio 11.0/VC/bin/amd64"

    platform sdk include: "/cygdrive/c/Program Files (x86)/Microsoft SDKs/Windows/v7.1A/Include"

    platform sdk lib: "/cygdrive/c/Program Files (x86)/Microsoft SDKs/Windows/v7.1A/Lib"


    ... into the Cygwin .bash_profile file as "PATH="/cygdrive/c/Program Files (x86)/Microsoft
    Visual Studio 11.0/VC/bin/amd64:/cygdrive/c/Program Files (x86)/Microsoft SDKs/Windows/v7.1A/Include:/cygdrive/c/Program
    Files (x86)/Microsoft SDKs/Windows/v7.1A/Lib:${PATH}" and it does pick up nmake
    - but not the SDK.


    I get error "Cannot open include file: ''windows.h'': No such file or directory"


    I also tried changing the include statements to  since the header file is upper
    case. Also tried the opposite where the include statements were left to default  and
    changed the SDK file to windows.h. No luck so far.


    Can you help me resolve this, please?'

    Can you try the VS2012 x64 Native Command Tools installed with Visual Studio 2012?


    I am using it for setting up the environment.


    Yours,
