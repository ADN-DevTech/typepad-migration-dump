  body: "Thanks, for that information!\nAt my studio we want to get deeper into xGen\
    \ python API, to create custom UI's for xGen. Unfortunately the Maya documentation\
    \ is pretty thin on that. Do you know or have any further resourches, documentations\
    \ on the xGen Python API?\n\nBest, \nOli"

  body: "Hi Oliver,\n\nUnfortunately, there aren't many documents more than the ones\
    \ on our website. But the XGen UI is open source, you can read and try to modify\
    \ it by yourself. It's in the xgen/scripts/xgenm/ui folder. \n\nIf you had problem\
    \ related to xgen Python API, you can post them on our forum or send us questions\
    \ through ADN support portal if you are an ADN member.\n\nYours,\nLi\n-----"
