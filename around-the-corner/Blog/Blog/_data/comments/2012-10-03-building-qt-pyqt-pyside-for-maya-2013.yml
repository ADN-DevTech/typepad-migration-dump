  body: What are the chances Autodesk will provide pre-compiled versions for users
    for future releases of Maya?  I got about as far as this post on my own before
    giving up (hit too many snags, the open ssl thing threw me for a loop) and just
    found a pre-compiled version online (2013 x64 win).  I'm reluctant to start authoring
    production-sensitive ui's that won't work in the next version of Maya until someone
    recompiles this stuff.  Thoughts?

  body: 'Hi Eric,

    I know what you mean, that whole thing isn''t an easy process for everyone. The
    main important point here is to remember you only need to recompile Qt source
    if you want to modify Qt source on your side which in this case Autodesk cannot
    provide you with your modified binaries. Maya ships Qt binaries and libraries
    that you can use directly. So the openssl comment is only relevant for those who
    wants to recompile Qt itself.


    Now I guess your comment was on providing PyQt or PySide binaries (may be both
    ;) - We survey developers on our annual API survey for the last 2 years (i.e.:
    <a href="http://around-the-corner.typepad.com/adn/2012/06/api-wishlist-surveys.html)">http://around-the-corner.typepad.com/adn/2012/06/api-wishlist-surveys.html)</a>
    and we saw a fair amount of people using either PyQt and/or PySide, so we are
    thinking about it...


    I did not posted the binaries here for legal implication in doing that, but I
    am ready to share my scripts on the 3 platforms for those interested.'

    I''m trying to install pyqt but when I''m in the step to build SIP I get some
    errors like this:

    you do not need Qt to build SIP, so in theory it should work fine with this


    subst v: whateverrootfolderyouwant

    cd \sip-4.13.3

    SET MSVC_DIR=C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0

    without seeing the ui file, I can''t really tell. I tried a simple ui file and
    it worked fine for me. Please copy me your code and I''ll try. Contact me by email

    tonight , so far I used other tutorial.

    Honestly is quite a pain to compile pyqt or pyside ( I am running into tons of
    errors and when i fix them other rises and so on ). I really hope autodesk will
    provide asap binaries at least for pyside for all platform (since pyside doesn''t
    have license problems for distributing).It would be so nice from autodesk :)'

  body: 'Hi Ken


    You cannot use x_86, it should be x86_64.

    and because you do not point to the 10.6.sdk, you are using the Lion 10.7 SDK
    which is the one by default on Lion.

    It also means you are using Xcode 4 vs Xcode 3.2.1 as it is specified in the Maya
    document. I know it is not always obvious what happens during compilation but
    you have to follow the exact steps to get it working.


    ./configure -prefix /Users/myHomeDir/qt-4.7.1 -arch x86_64 -debug-and-release
    -no-rpath -silent -no-qt3support -sdk /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.6.sdk


    If the /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.6.sdk does not exist on your system, that means
    you do not have the Xcode 3.2.1 compiler, nor the 10.6 SDK which are required.
    In that case please install them - they can be installed side by side to Xcode
    4 and the 10.7 SDK.


    Hope that will help,

    -----'
