  body: 'Hi there,


    We are trying to build PySide2 for Python 2.7 in Win 10. We managed to compile
    to a wheel where you would have to have Qt installed on the system. We would like
    to compile to where Qt does not need to be installed on the system to use PySide2.


    Would we follow the same steps outlined above, but instead of using mayapy, we
    would use the python 2.7 executable?


    It''s hard to find info on this as it stands right now, so any information on
    this would be very helpful. There must be many studios, that want to build a PySide2
    installer that does not require Qt to be installed.


    Thanks for putting solid information out there,

  body: 'I have to say that for someone that is not familiar with compiling Qt the
    bundled instructions in "howToBuildQtOnWindows_m2017.txt" are severely lacking.


    What is the "icu53_1" reference?

    What is "your normal options" for configure.exe?

    The general tone of the instructions makes me feel like they were written for
    people who does this stuff on a frequent basis.


    I would really appreciate a better set of instructions.'

  body: 'Hi Christian,


    Using python 2.7 should be OK. But we recommend to use Python built with VS2012
    to avoid any potential runtime issues. That''s the reason why I am using mayapy.


    I think you can''t build PySide without a QT environment. But once it is built,  you
    can copy the binary outputs to other computers you need.


    Yours,

    Li
