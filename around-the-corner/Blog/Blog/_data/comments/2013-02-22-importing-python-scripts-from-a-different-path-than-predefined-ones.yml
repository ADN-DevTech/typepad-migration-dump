  body: Just curious - why did you went through all the MEL trouble when it's just
    "import sys; sys.path.append(r'/MyPath/scripts')" in a Python tab?

  body: 'Hi Viktoras


    You''re absolutely right, if you got a change to put that code in a button, menu,
    shelves - you do not need that. But if you are in C++ (without using Python C++
    libs), .NET, then you''re locked.   The are other situation where you would need
    this too, and I''ll explain in more details in a future post.
