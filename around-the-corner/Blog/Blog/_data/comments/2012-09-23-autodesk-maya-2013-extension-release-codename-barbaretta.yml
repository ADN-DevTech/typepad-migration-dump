  body: 'The Extension release and the Service Pack are incompatible. The Service
    Pack 2 applies to Maya 2013 only and does not contain the Extension API/features.
    However, it contains almost the same list of bugfixes.

    What is important to note for future is that there might be a Service Pack 3 or
    another Hotfix later in the year. This Service Pack or Hotfix would be release
    in 2 versions - one for 2013 and  one for the 2013 Extension.'

  body: Thanks - could you explain how can I do that? i.e., how can I install 2013.5
    as a standalone and not as a patch on 2013?

    just run the Maya Extension release installer, it will install in a different
    directory. Note that the Extension release is not the same as the Service Pack
    Release. So if you have the installer complaining, you certainly not have the
    Extension installer but teh Service Pack installer.
