  body: Hi Cyrille - I'm wondering if you've had any luck building pyqt for maya2017
    yet?  Your notes for prior versions of maya are indispensible!  Looking forward
    to seeing this round when you get time.  Cheers - James.

  body: "Hey!\n\nI was working on a maya 2016 and when 2017 came out I began porting\
    \ my work to 2017 due to the fact that it uses qt5 which has built in features\
    \ that I need.\nStraightaway I ran into a lot of issues that come from deep inside\
    \ qt itself (e.g. QString::toStdString function causing crashes, \nWorkaround:\
    \ use call .toLocal8Bit().constData() instead)  .\n\n\nAnother issue is with the\
    \ qt examples, they worked fine for qt4 but there are some breaking changes that\
    \ make them bad reference point for develops e.g.:\n\nUsing QPointer to store\
    \ the pointer to the plugin window will cause memory access violation due to major\
    \ change in QPointer implementation in qt5, the following is from Qt docs:\nNote\
    \ that Qt 5 introduces a slight change in behavior when using QPointer.\n\n\"\
    When using QPointer on a QWidget (or a subclass of QWidget), previously the QPointer\
    \ would be cleared by the QWidget destructor. Now, the QPointer is cleared by\
    \ the QObject destructor (since this is when QWeakPointer objects are cleared).\
    \ Any QPointers tracking a widget will NOT be cleared before the QWidget destructor\
    \ destroys the children for the widget being tracked.\"\n\nthe workaround so far\
    \ is to use QSharedPointer.\n\n-----"
