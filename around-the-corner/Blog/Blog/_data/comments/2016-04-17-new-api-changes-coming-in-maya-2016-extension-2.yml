  body: 'It seems it has renewed the Effects11 library (d3dx11effect.h changed in
    devkit includes), I guess it uses a later version like this one on GitHub

    https://fx11.codeplex.com


    Can you give some informations about the exact Effects11 release used, and if
    the DirectX was used from the old DirectX-SDK or from a current Windows Kit?


    There seem to be some behavior changed with Maya 2016 Extension 2 - everything
    was still working. Maybe I better have to precompile the Effects - but I guess
    Maya also compiles the Effects at runtime for its own, because in an environment
    like Maya this makes perfectly sense.'

  body: Actually, the build environment of Maya 2016 Extension 2 is very similar as
    the version of Maya 2016. But yes, I will post a detail update for Maya 2016 Extension
    2 to make it clear as you suggested. Thanks.
