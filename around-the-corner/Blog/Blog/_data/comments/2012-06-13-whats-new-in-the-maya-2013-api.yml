  body: 'I didnt mean Your post but this page:

    <a href="http://docs.autodesk.com/MAYAUL/2013/ENU/Maya-API-Documentation/python-api/index.html">http://docs.autodesk.com/MAYAUL/2013/ENU/Maya-API-Documentation/python-api/index.html</a>

  body: "Oh, I am with you now! Thanks for explaining! So this is Python 2.0 and it's\
    \ going to take a couple of releases to finish as you have noticed everything\
    \ is not there yet including MImage, it will come in time. If you need MImage\
    \ continue to use the Python 1.0 that has everything you need in this namespace:\n\
    \nimport maya.OpenMaya as OpenMaya\n\nrather then the Python 2.0 namespace:\n\n\
    import maya.api.OpenMaya as newOpenMaya \n\nThis actually would be a good post\
    \ topic on explaining the how Python 2.0 is additional to the original 1.0.\n\n\
