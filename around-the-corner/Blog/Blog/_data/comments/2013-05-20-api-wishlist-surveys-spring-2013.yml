    Is there anyway to avoid the special last step involving install_name_tool when
    installing PySide for Maya 2012/2013 in osx?


    I tried just using DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH and PYTHONPATH for setting it up as on linux
    but it didn''t work. Not too familiar with osx development but it seems like a
    strange step.


    There is also some issues with the instructions that you might wan''t to edit:

    1.

    export SHIBOKEN_DIR=/Users/myHomeDir/shiboken-1.1.2/_output

    should be

    export SHIBOKEN_DIR=/Users/myHomeDir/shiboken-1.1.2/_output/lib/cmake/Shiboken-1.1.2


    2.

    when cmaking

    -DALTERNATE_QT_INCLUDE_DIR=$QTDIR/include

    should be

    -DALTERNATIVE_QT_INCLUDE_DIR=$QTDIR/include


    3.

    there is also a bug in the qt src

    in src/plugins/bearer/corewlan "|" needs to be replaced with "||" otherwise qt
    wont compile


    4.

    The instructions when building qt for mac says something about that there is a
    bug in qt and files need to be copied for qmake to work. I skipped doing this
    and it made no difference.'

  body: So i figured out i can keep my PySide .so and .dylib files outside of the
    /Applications folder by linking them against @executable_app and using PYTHONPATH
    and DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH to find them but I can't get QtWebKit to work as the QtWebKit
    in maya is linked against @executable_app/phonon but phonon is not included. Is
    there any way to solve this?

    I could compile Qt, PyQt, PySide without changing the code like you did, so that''s
    really strange that you had to. Anyway, I can see phonon present in my distribution
    /Applications/Autodesk/maya2013/Maya.app/Contents/MacOS/phonon so I am not sure
    I understand your issue. I''ll try to contact you by email and follow-up from
    there
