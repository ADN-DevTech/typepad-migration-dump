  body: 'Sure! Actually anyone can register Maya node IDs (and should register some
    if they intend to share files outside their companies).


    For this go to <a href="http://www.autodesk.com/developmaya">http://www.autodesk.com/developmaya</a>
    and go to the ''Register a Maya Developer Node ID Block'' section. You''ll find
    a link there to self-register your ID block.'
