  body: 'I''m writing this comment in the hope that some Autodesk Maya developer will
    read this. You have added MExternalDropCallback class way in Maya 2013 (http://around-the-corner.typepad.com/adn/2012/06/whats-new-in-the-maya-2013-api.html)
    which helps dropping stuff into Maya UI from custom Qt widgets. But as far as
    I''m concerned (and other people to: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/python_inside_maya/EyY6QY4jPhc)
    there is no hook for dragging and dropping objects from Maya UI into custom Qt
    widgets. It would be very nice I you would think about adding some class or extending
    MExternalDropCallback to support that behaviour.
