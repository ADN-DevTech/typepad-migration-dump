  body: Nice, thanks. Concerning Maya, I would really like to learn more about this.
    Are we just talking about scriptJobs here (that's the way I allways use(d) in
    scripts, even in python-times), or are there some other, 'more up to date' possibilities,
    e.g. using python and api?

  body: "Hi Kristine,\n\nHow would you register a callback on a newly created shapeNode's\
    \ transform?\nI want to have a callback added within a py node plugin:\n\ndef\
    \ postConstructor(self):\n    nodeFn = OpenMaya.MFnDependencyNode(self.thisMObject())\n\
    \    nodeFn.setName(\"hape#\" % self.typeName())\n\n    dpath = OpenMaya.MDagPath()\n\
    \       OpenMaya.MDagPath.getAPathTo(self.thisMObject(), dpath)\n\n    dpath.transform()\n\
    \    self._cbchild = OpenMaya.MDagMessage.addChildAddedDagPathCallback( dpath,\
    \ self._childAdded, nodeFn )\n\nThe problem I'm having is that the transform's\
    \ dag path is not recognized at this stage and the callback cannot be registered.\n\
    \nI cannot add the shape node's dagPath as I want to get a callback whenever a\
    \ child is parented underneath the transform.\n\nDo you have any solution to this\
    \ issue?"

  body: "Hi Felix,\n\nThe concept of callbacks is somewhat general in Maya, then there\
    \ is specific channels to implement them, as you mentioned ScriptJobs is definitely\
    \ one way to do it, which can be accessed through MEL or Python Scripting commands.\n\
    \nAnd then another way to do it would be using the C++ or Python API, using the\
    \ class MMessage and all the children classes located under it, you would choose\
    \ a specific child class based on what functionality you wanted to watch and setup\
    \ a call back on, you can take a look at the Maya API Docs online here for more\
    \ information on MMessage and it's children classes:\n\n<a href=\"http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/item?id=16707768&siteID=123112\"\
    >http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/item?id=16707768&siteID=123112</a>\n\nAlso\
    \ there is some good samples of this in the devkit that comes with Maya, \n\n\
    Hope that answers your question, \n\nKristine"

  body: "Hi mtmy\n\nAdding a ChildAddedDagPathCallback is possible on DAG nodes only.\
    \ If your node is not a DAG node and/or if the callback signature is not correct,\
    \ the callback will not work.\n\nI modified the rockingTransform node sample like\
    \ below and I got a print on the Maya output window whenever I add a child to\
    \ it. Let us know if you still experiencing an issue on your side.\n\nHope that\
    \ helps\ncyrille\n\ndef childAdded (dgchild, dgparent, clientData):\n  print \"\
