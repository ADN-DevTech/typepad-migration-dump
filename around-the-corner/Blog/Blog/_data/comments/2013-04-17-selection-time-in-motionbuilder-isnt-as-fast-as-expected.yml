    original post about compiling PySide for Maya.


    Do you have any suggestions for using the Maya compiled PySide without putting
    it in ldconfig?

    If I do so it conflicts with the systems main version of PySide which is compiled
    against an older Qt version.


    I could ofc make an alias that sets LD_LIBRARY_PATH and PYTHONPATH before launching  maya
    but would like to use the regular bin if possible.'

  body: 'Not really :(

    I know it is sometimes possible to use PySide/PyQt packages built with a slightly
    different version of Qt, but this is not really recommended and only works (as
    far I know) with minors Qt/PySide/PyQt updates.

    If anyone knows and can help, I''d be interested to know as well.
