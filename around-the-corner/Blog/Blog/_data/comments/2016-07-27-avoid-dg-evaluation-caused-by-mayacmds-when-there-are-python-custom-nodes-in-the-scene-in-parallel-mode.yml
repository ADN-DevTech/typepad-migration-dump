  body: does this also apply to high volume mel commands? I am having the same issue
    when i evaluate a mel command at every frame on the time line, the system locks
    and crashes due to a memory access violation. i assume because the previous command
    was not finished operating on the object before the new mel command was called
    on the same object.

  body: I think this is applied to commands need to be executed during idle. Maybe
    it is a little different from your issue.

  body: 'We are also working with custom locators and something baffles me...


    if you do a spaceLocator or nurbsCurve, copy it 400 times and set keys on the
    transform you might get about 200 fps when doing playback...


    Compile the footPrintNode from the devkit and do the same and you get 23 fps (60
    fps with the geometryOverride version)


    Without keys on the transform the viewport performance is fine.... any clue why?


    Best wishes... Jakob'

  body: 'This bug is pretty nasty. Even calling out to mel from python causes the
    crash so unless you can rewrite your whole tool in mel the work around isn''t
    doable. Further, even disabling parallel evaluation will not fix it in all cases.
    If parallel is disabled but viewport2.0 is enabled it will usually still crash
    when calling cmds.playblast(). In other words you can''t use python node plugins
    with viewport2.0 OR parallel eval. Not good.
