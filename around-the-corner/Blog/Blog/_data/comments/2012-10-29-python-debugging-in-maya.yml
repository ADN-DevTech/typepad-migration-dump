  body: '+1 for Wing:  I''ve been using it for remote-debugging for years now:  Nothing
    like stepping through code in Wing, and watching Maya live update.  I don''t know
    about the other software you mentioned, but I believe you can get remote debugging
    only with the ''pro'' version of Wing, which is a couple hundred bucks these days.  Still,
    worth it IMO compared to the complexities of having to deal with setting up Eclipse.
