  body: "Hi Felix\nNo, if you are happy with PySide, use PySide since it comes with\
    \ Maya by default. These build instructions are for people who cannot move easily\
    \ to PySide for legacy reasons. There are few minors differences such as changing\
    \ the imports, and the big one is \n\nwidget = shiboken.wrapInstance(long(ptr),\
    \ QtCore.QObject)\n\nyou have to give shiboken (not sip) the actual type of object.\
    \ You can't rely on sip to figure it out.\n\nOtherwise, the port is very easy,\
    \ but I know some people would prefer staying with PyQt.\n\n-cyrille"

    Nevermind my last comment. Did not realize these were .bat files. All is well.
    Thank you for these great tutorials.
