  body: "Hello Cyrille,\n\nThanks for the great note.\nAs you briefly talked about\
    \ Custom Node attributes here that made me curious about \nif there is any way\
    \ of listing all the plugs/attributes attached to a dependency graph node using\
    \ API command.\n\neg: using MFnDependencyNode() we can access a particular plug\
    \ if we know its name.\n\nmFnDN = OpenMaya.MFnDependencyNode(mObj_node)\nvisibility_plug\
    \ = mFnDN.findPlug(\"visibility\")\n\n\n\nIn this case a single plug is accessed\
    \ and we know its name.\nIs there any command which can list all the plugs of\
    \ a dependency graph node (if we don't know that names of all the plugs) ?\n\n\
    \nThanks,\nChayan"

  body: "Hi Chayan,\n\nyes, you can list plugs using: MFnDependencyNode::attributeCount()\
    \ / MFnDependencyNode::attribute()\n \nbut in case you want the connected plugs,\
    \ you will need: MFnDependencyNode::getConnections()\n\nPlugs on a node found\
    \ in this way can come and go based on a number of internal optimization reasons\
    \ so the list you are asking for is not necessarily going to be consistent each\
    \ time you ask.\n\nHope that helps,\n-cyrille\n-----"
