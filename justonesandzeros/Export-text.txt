BODY:
<p>This post follows a continuous demand to integrate the extension &quot;Reserve Numbers&quot; in other environments.</p>
<p>First, let me briefly introduce the scope and benefits of this extension sample for those who have never heard about &quot;Reserve Numbers&quot;:&#0160;</p>
<p><strong>Reserve Numbers</strong> allows Vault Professional Client users to create numbers consuming Vault File, Item, or Change Order numbering schemes.</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/.a/6a0120a5728249970b02c8d39aea47200c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false" style="display: inline;"><img alt="VDS Reserve Numbers 2023" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0120a5728249970b02c8d39aea47200c img-responsive" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/.a/6a0120a5728249970b02c8d39aea47200c-320wi" title="VDS Reserve Numbers 2023" /></a>&#0160;</p>
<p><strong>Outcome Options | Benefits</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Leverages Numbering Scheme per Entity types
<ul>
<li>Files (also used for Folders, Custom Objects)</li>
<li>Items</li>
<li>Change Orders</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Reserving Item Numbers creates empty items</li>
<li>Generated Numbers are copied to the Windows Clipboard and can be directly pasted into tables using the CTRL+V keys, e.g., Inventor iPart or Model State part number columns.</li>
</ul>
<p>Reserve Numbers is a Vault Data Standard extension and ships with my well-known sample configuration VDS-MFG-Sample. Now, suppose you want to copy this tool into your customized environment. In that case, you need to know some steps not as obvious as copying the additional configuration files sharing the name &quot;*<em>reservenumbers*</em>&quot;.</p>
<p>My new instructional presentation detailed the copy and merge tasks: <span class="asset  asset-generic at-xid-6a0120a5728249970b02c8d39f041f200b img-responsive"><a href="https://autode.sk/40esfzk">Download Autodesk Vault Data Standard -- Customization Sample ReserveNumbers</a></span></p>
<p>Happy reserving :),</p>

BODY:
<p>The &quot;Project Thunderdome&quot; is alive and published updated source code and installers for 2023 and 2024 today!</p>
<p>You might have lost the track that &quot;Project Thunderdome&quot; took over the past few years when it disappeared from the App Store.</p>
<p>So there is good news about the current <strong>&quot;Thunderdome Sample&quot;</strong> code base:</p>
<ul>
<li>Access source code and installer versions on the projects &quot;Releases&quot; section for Vault 2022, 2023 and 2024</li>
<li>The latest update (2023.1, 2024.1) filters _V folders from custom folder deployments downloading files from Vault</li>
<li>The fork &quot;Thunderdome Sample&quot; is slightly different from &quot;Project Thunderdome&quot; latest app store version:
<ul>
<li>Manage deployments leveraging the role permissions of Configuration Admins instead of the built-in Administrator user</li>
<li>Include Search Groups in deployments</li>
<li>Include Data Standard Custom Help files</li>
<li>Include custom folder deployments</li>
<li>Access source code (<a href="https://github.com/koechlm/Vault-Thunderdome-Sample">Thunderdome Sample</a>) and installable versions for evaluations (<a href="https://github.com/koechlm/Vault-Thunderdome-Sample/releases">Thunderdome Sample Releases</a>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>But - you should follow the latest Vault Professional enhancements in 2024: Inventor Vault auto-deploys Design Data and Templates with a straightforward setup: Extend the Vault IPJ mapping with design data and template folders, and all Vault users stay up to date with the latest styles and templates.</strong></p>
<p>The sample extension did not adopt Vault light or dark themes for good reasons: it required a complete re-design of the admin and user dialogs based on Windows presentation foundation dialogs (leveraging the themed resources of Vault Data Standard) or would enforce individual DevExpress licensing on your side if I implemented themed forms based on the DevExpress libraries.</p>

BODY:
<p>Autodesk Vault 2023 Clients introduced an updated themed user interface. As a user, I can select the <strong>Light</strong> (default install), <strong>Dark</strong>, or the legacy <strong>Classic</strong> theme for Vault Explorer. The CAD addins, like Vault for AutoCAD or Inventor, adopt the parent application&#39;s theme, Dark or Light. <a class="asset-img-link" href="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/.a/6a0120a5728249970b02b7519d5f28200c-pi" style="float: right;"><img alt="New File Dialog Themed 2023.2" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0120a5728249970b02b7519d5f28200c img-responsive" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/.a/6a0120a5728249970b02b7519d5f28200c-320wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" title="New File Dialog Themed 2023.2" /></a><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/.a/6a0120a5728249970b02b685302e53200d-pi"></a></p>
<p>Vault Data Standard (VDS) fully supports themes starting with the 2023 Update 2 as a minimum release version. The default configuration of Update 2 renewed all dialogs and data sheets.</p>
<p>Now - there is the question, how can your customized VDS configuration benefit from these new capabilities? Unfortunately, this question is rarely asked :(. Instead, I see forum posts, support requests, and emails asking, <em>&quot;We updated to Vault Professional 2023, and now all Data Standard dialogs are broken!&quot;&#0160;</em></p>
<p>If your <em><strong>custom</strong></em> dialogs (migrated from earlier Vault releases) miss the title bar, pull-down menus, or even more, you must update the style section of yo<a class="asset-img-link" href="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/.a/6a0120a5728249970b02b685302f83200d-pi" style="float: right;"><img alt="VDS Migration 2023.2 - Addendum Themes" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0120a5728249970b02b685302f83200d img-responsive" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/.a/6a0120a5728249970b02b685302f83200d-320wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" title="VDS Migration 2023.2 - Addendum Themes" /></a>ur dialogs and data sheets. Acknowledged - this is unexpected work. But I can guarantee that you will like the result and the simplification if you have tried before to make your dialogs stylish.</p>
<p>I put together step-by-step instructions on updating your customized files: <a href="https://autode.sk/3IsdG1T" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Autodesk Vault Data Standard 2023 - Updates and Migration</a>. If you are familiar with VDS but less with &quot;Themes&quot; and &quot;Styles,&quot; start reading the crash course first. Experienced configuration administrators will benefit from tips, deriving themed messaging, and more. <a class="asset-img-link" href="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/.a/6a0120a5728249970b02b7519d6097200c-pi"><img alt="Themed Messaging" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0120a5728249970b02b7519d6097200c img-responsive" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/.a/6a0120a5728249970b02b7519d6097200c-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Themed Messaging" /></a></p>

Hi Paul, I verified on mobile and PC. The link worked if the browser either supports PDF inline viewing or the pop-up blocker is open for downloads. I could not identify any issue with the link itself. I hope you can resolve the access trying another device/browser.

<p>I am a&#0160; Sr. Solutions Engineer in the Autodesk EMEA Technical Sales organization. You might have seen my name in the Vault customization forum, Autodesk Knowledge Network (AKN), and AU classes or even accessed my public <a href="https://github.com/koechlm?tab=repositories" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GitHub</a> repository for Vault sample applications.</p>
<p>This blog got silent for the past few years as Doug&#39;s role changed and new content spread to other repositories. Anyway - a huge part of the stuff here is still valid; the SDK Help documentation continues linking to samples of this blog... So - there are good reasons to bring everything back to this famous spot and breathe new life into this blog. Vault customization is my passion, and I will do my best to serve with valuable contributions soon.</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Markus</p>

<p>Hi Folks,</p>
<p>My name is Jeffrey Fishman. I&#39;m a software engineer with the Vault team, and I&#39;m hoping to bring along some goodies you&#39;ll find interesting! I&#39;ll include a photo of myself below:</p>
<p><img height="430" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/JeffreyFishman.jpg" width="232" /></p>
<p>The Effective Permissions sample application has been updated to work with the Vault 2021 SDK and client. Since the client now has a native tab to view effective permissions per object, that functionality was removed from the sample application. It&#39;ll simply show a permissions matrix users have for each Vault folder, depending on how you&#39;ve configured the sample application settings.</p>
<p>For those who haven&#39;t tried this sample app yet, it calculates which permissions a user will ultimately have for viewing and manipulating a folder in Vault. You can configure the folder depth you wish to be displayed in the matrix, starting from the Vault&#39;s root folder ($).&#0160; You can also configure whether you&#39;d like permissions to be displayed for users who don&#39;t have access to the current vault but may be available on the Vault Server, or users who have been disabled on the Vault. The last settings available are folder exclusions and inclusions. The blacklist takes higher precedence over the inclusion, and the inclusion allows you to add folders to the results that may be out of the configured folder depth&#39;s scope.</p>
<p>As a quick side note -- you&#39;ll want to add in a key to sign the sample code if you wish to compile it. Visual Studio allows you to do this right inside of the IDE by right-clicking on the assembly, selecting &#39;Properties&#39;, and then moving to the &#39;Signing&#39; section on the left of the assembly properties window.&#0160;</p>
<p>Outside of Visual Studio, the .NET Framework provides a utility to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/tools/sn-exe-strong-name-tool?redirectedfrom=MSDN#examples">generate strong-name key files you can find by clicking here.</a></p>

<p>Hello everyone, my name is Paul Gunn.</p>
<p>I&#39;m a software architect on Vault and recently taught a class on the Vault 2019 API at Autodesk University 2018. Doug attended my class and graciously offered the opportunity to share this information with you as a guest blogger.</p>
<p>My class delved into new server APIs that provide (what we believe to be) new and powerful capabilities to developers. Here at Autodesk we have implemented a major client-side feature on this platform and other features in the pipe are similarly leveraging this functionality. The class downloads section includes the class handout and demo application (&#39;material&#39; zip file) - and a recording of the class is also available.</p>
<p>Here are resources available online:</p>

<p>Today my blog turns 6, which is 110 years is binary.&#0160; To celebrate, I’m going to reveal a couple of Easter Eggs that I’ve slipped in over the years.&#0160; Specifically, the titles of some of my apps.&#0160; One thing I love about writing my own apps is that I get to pick the name.&#0160; An in two cases, I named the app in such a way as to set up a joke.&#0160; That’s just the type of guy I am.</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p><strong>Project Thunderdome:</strong></p>
<p>Yes, it’s part of a movie title, but the joke goes deeper than that.&#0160; It’s probably best explained by this Mystery Science Theater 300 clip.&#0160; By the way, I’m a huge MST3K fan.</p>
<p><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XEI_udV88i4" width="420"></iframe></p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p><strong>The TTP Project:</strong></p>
<p>This app never achieved the popularity of Thunderdome, which is a shame.&#0160; I wanted to unload this joke on more people.&#0160; Basically the conversation would go like this.</p>
<p>(me an you chatting about PLM API programming) <br />Me: … You should check out my sample app, The TTP Project? <br />You: What does TTP stand for? <br />Me: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">T</span>he <span style="text-decoration: underline;">T</span>TP <span style="text-decoration: underline;">P</span>roject</p>
<p>Again, I stole this joke from <a href="http://dilbert.com/strip/1994-05-18">another source</a>.&#0160; Because that’s also the type of guy I am.</p>

BODY:
<p>In PLM Scripting, the built-in object under item matching the <strong>Project Management </strong>tab is <strong><em>Project</em> </strong>object. An <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array" target="_blank">Array</a> of <strong><em>Project</em></strong> objects will be returned by calling <em>item.project.subTasks. </em>They give you all the projects of the item. The item here must be an instance of <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2015/05/item-in-script.html" target="_blank">Item</a>.</p>
<p>Basically a project task can be divided into three classes: text task, linked task and milestone task. In scripting, all of them are represented using <strong><em>Project</em></strong> object, but there is some difference when we deal with each of them. In this post, let’s talk about what the common ground they have and what the difference between them.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Text project task</strong></p>
<p>A text project task is a task not linked to any item. Its title is given by user.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>var textTask = item.project.subTasks[0];</em></p>
<p><em>// r/w title <br />textTask.title = ‘new title’;</em></p>
<p><em>// r/w start date of project <br />textTask.start_date = new Date();</em></p>
<p><em>// r/w end date of project <br />textTask.end_date = new Date(new Date().getTime() + 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000);</em></p>
<p><em>// r/w progress, must be in [0, 100] <br />textTask.progress = 50;</em></p>
<p><em>// read duration <br />var duration = textTask.duration;</em></p>
<p><em>// read owner, the parent item of the project <br />var owner = textTask.owner;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p><strong>Linked project task</strong></p>
<p>A linked project task is a task linking to an item. It also has the same properties as a text project task, however the <em>title</em> property will be the linked item’s descriptor instead of the text defined by the user. The linked item can be gotten via <em>linkedTask.item. </em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>var linkedTask = item.project.subTasks[1];</em></p>
<p><em>// read linked item. An Item object is returned <br />var linkedItem = linkedTask.item;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p><strong>Milestone project task (Read-only task)</strong></p>
<p>If a linked project contains milestones, then we call it a milestone project task, or a read-only project task because all the properties of it are read-only. That’s the only difference between linked task and milestone task.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Create project task</strong></p>
<p>The general form to create a task is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>new Task(Title/LinkedItem[, StartDate[, EndDate[,Progress]]]);</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The square brackets parts are optional. The default value for both start and end dates is today, and the default progress is 0.</p>
<p>Create a text task:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>// create a text task <br />var newTextTask = new Task(‘Text Task’, new Date(), new Date(new Date().getTime() + 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000), 0); <br />// add task into array <br />item.project.subTasks.push(newTextTask);</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Create a linked/read-only task:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>// fetch item to be linked <br />var itemToBeLinked = loadItem(1234); <br />// create linked task, leave the rest parameters default <br />var newLinkedTask = new Task(itemToBeLinked); <br />// add new task into array <br />item.project.subTasks.push(newLinkedTask);</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In prior posts, Doug introduced a couple <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2015/01/2-undocumented-functions.html" target="_blank">undocumented methods</a> in the Filestore Service and described how you could use them to <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2015/02/roll-your-own-copy-design.html" target="_blank">roll your own copy design</a>. In this installment, I’ll show you how to use them to sync up properties to get rid of property equivalence errors.</p>
<p>A vaulted file will have property equivalence errors if it needs to have property values written back to it.&#0160; This behavior is controlled by the write mappings in the property definitions. The errors mean that the property values in the vault database not matching the property values stored within the file. You can remedy this situation by doing a property sync in Vault Explorer, but that’s too easy – instead let’s do the property sync via the Vault 2016 API.</p>
<p>In the Document Service there is a rather obscure method called <strong>GetComponentProperties</strong>, whose description in the help reads: “Gets property data for a file which has been assigned to an item”. What this method really does (in 2015-R2 and beyond) is provide exactly what needs to be written back to a file in order for it to have property equivalence. And it isn’t limited to files that have been assigned to items – it works perfectly fine where no items are present (such as in Vault Workgroup or Vault Basic).</p>
<p>Since nothing is easy, there are a number of potential issues that we will need to work around. First of all, if you were to blindly take the property data from GetComponentProperties and feed it to CopyFile, you may notice datetimes shifting by your timezone offset; or numerical values shifting by orders of magnitude in locales where the thousandths separator is a period (“.”) and the decimal point is a comma (“,”). That is some serious badness that must be avoided. Also, we don’t want to create a new version of each file we sync if we didn’t actually do anything – that would be really annoying.</p>
<p>I have wrapped up everything that needs to happen to avoid these issues in a simple class (“PropertySync”) which just has a constructor and one method. The idea is to gather the files you want to do the sync for, construct the PropertySync object once and then call its SyncProperties method on each file. The reason for the two-step process is so it only needs to get property definitions once. Many more details are in the comments.</p>

This helped me out a lot! The item master doesn't appear to honor the lifecycle transition action: "Sync properties and update view using Job Server". I assumed that the new lifecycle functionality for item’s would perform a property sync on associated files and put them in the job queue for DWF creation but that doesn’t appear to be the case so this gave me a good work around for now. Thanks again!

BODY:
<p>In the last two posts, we saw how to access item’s <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2015/05/item-object-fields.html" target="_blank">fields</a> and <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2015/06/item-object-master-property.html" target="_blank">ownership</a> information. We are not done talking about <strong>Item</strong> object. There are still many things we would like to cover. But before then, I am going to wrap up another object which was mentioned when we were introducing the <strong><a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2015/06/item-object-master-property.html" target="_blank">Master</a></strong> property in <strong>Item</strong>. That’s the <strong>Security</strong> object. The <strong>Security</strong> object contains some utility functions dealing with users, groups and roles. And we have seen the examples using its <em>loadUser()</em> and <em>loadGroup()</em> functions. We are going to see what else the <strong>Security</strong> object has.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Security.inGroup()</strong></p>
<p><em>Security.inGroup(userId, groupName) </em>returns a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Boolean" target="_blank">Boolean</a> object to indicate if the group specified by <em>groupName </em>(<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String" target="_blank">String</a>) contains the user specified by <em>userId</em> (<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String" target="_blank">String</a>). For example,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>if (Security.inGroup(userID, ‘Admin Group’)) { <br />&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; // the current user is in Admin Group&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; <br />} else { <br />&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; // the current user is NOT in Admin Group <br />}</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">Notes: The <em>userID</em> is one of the pre-loaded variables for each script indicating the user whose action triggers the script. Usually it is the current login user’s ID.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Security.inRole()</strong></p>
<p><em>Security.inRole(userId, roleName)</em> checks if the user specified by the <em>userId</em> is in the role specified by <em>roleName </em>(<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String" target="_blank">String</a>) by returning a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Boolean" target="_blank">Boolean</a> object. The <em>roleName</em> is the displayed name for each role in Roles page [Administration –&gt; Security –&gt; Roles].</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Security.loadUser() </strong></p>
<p><em>Security.loadUser(userId)</em> returns the <strong>User</strong> specified by the userId. If no user can be found with the <em>userId</em>, then an empty <strong>User</strong> will be returned. For example,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>var user = Security.loadUser(‘Abc’); <br />if (user.id === null) { <br />&#0160; println(“The user cannot be found.”); <br />}</em></p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p><strong>Security.loadGroup()</strong></p>
<p><em>Security.loadGroup(groupName) </em>returns the <strong>Group</strong> specified by the <em>groupName</em>. Like <em>loadUser</em> if no group cannot be found with the <em>groupName</em>, an empty <strong>Group</strong> object will be returned.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Security.listGroups() </strong></p>
<p><em>Security.listGroups(userId)</em> returns an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array" target="_blank">Array</a> of group names (<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String" target="_blank">String</a>) which the user belongs to.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Security.listRoles() </strong></p>
<p><em>Security.listRoles(userId) </em>returns an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array" target="_blank">Array</a> of role names (<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String" target="_blank">String</a>) which the user has. Roles don’t have direct relationship with users. Group is the middle connector with them. So to get all the roles for a user, first the server will find all the groups the user belongs to. Next all the roles in each of those groups will be collected. Then after removing all the duplicates (one role could be added into multiple groups), the collection will be returned to you.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Security.listUsersInGroup() </strong></p>
<p><em>Security.listUsersInGroup(groupName) </em>returns an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array" target="_blank">Array</a> of users (<strong>User</strong> objects) that in the group.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Security.listUsersInRole() </strong></p>
<p><em>Security.listUsersInRole(roleName) </em>returns an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array" target="_blank">Array</a> of users (<strong>User</strong> objects) that in the role.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Security.searchUsers()</strong></p>
<p><em>Security.searchUsers(criteria) </em>returns an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array" target="_blank">Array</a> of users (<strong>User</strong> objects) matching the criteria. For example, the below function will return all the users with professional licenses and located in Toronto.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>function getAllProfessionalUsersInToronto() { <br />&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; var criteria = { <br />&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; city : &#39;Toronto&#39;, <br />&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; licenseCode: &#39;S&#39; <br />&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; }; <br />&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; return Security.searchUsers(criteria); <br />}</em></p>

BODY:
<p><strong>Master</strong> is one property of <strong>Item</strong> object. It contains the item’s DMS ID, workspace ID, owner, additional user owners and additional group owners. In this post, we will go through each of them.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Item’s DMS ID</strong></p>
<p><em>item.master.dmsID</em> returns the item’s DMS ID which is read-only <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number" target="_blank">Number</a> type.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Item’s workspace ID</strong></p>
<p><em>item.master.workspaceID</em> returns the ID of the workspace which the item belongs to, which is read-only <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number" target="_blank">Number</a> type.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Item’s owner</strong></p>
<p><em>item.master.owner </em>returns an <strong>User</strong> object contains the information about that owner user, e.g. name, phone, email, license, etc. That’s all you need to know about <strong>User</strong> object at this moment. We will have a separate post to focus on it.</p>
<p>The owner property is editable, so we can update the item’s owner using script.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>var newOwner = Security.loadUser(‘newOwnerUserId’); <em><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><strong>// load user with id <br /></strong></span></em>item.master.owner = newOwner;&#0160; <span style="font-size: xx-small;"><strong>// update owner</strong></span></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here we use<em> Security.loadUser(‘newOwnerUserId’) </em>to get a new owner user. The function takes an user ID; returns the <strong>User</strong> object representing the user. The <strong>Security</strong> object can be used to handle users, groups and roles. We will be explained in detail in the future post. In this post, we only need to know how you to use its <em>loadUser</em> function and <em>loadGroup</em> function.</p>
<p>We are also able to clone the owner from another item like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>item.master.owner = loadItem(1234).master.owner;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p><strong>Item’s additional user owners</strong></p>
<p><em>item.master.additionalOwners</em> gives us an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array" target="_blank">Array</a> of <strong>User </strong>objects. To add additional user owners, we need to push each user object into this array.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>var newAdditionalUserOwner = Security.loadUser(‘UserId’); <br />item.master.additionalOwners.<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/push" target="_blank">push</a>(newAdditionalUserOwner);</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To remove all the additional user owners, we can do this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>item.master.additionalOwners.length = 0;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To find and remove particular additional user owner, we can use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/splice" target="_blank"><em>splice</em></a>,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>var ownerToRemove = Security.loadUser(‘UserId’); <br /></em><em>var index = item.master.additionalOwners.indexOf(ownerToRemove); <br />if (index &gt; -1) { // <span style="font-size: 8pt;"><strong>if the owner exists in the array</strong> </span><br />&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; item.master.additionalOwners.splice(index, 1); <br /></em><em>}</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If we want to send email notification to all the additional user owners, we could use the code like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>var additionalOwners = item.master.additionalOwners; <br />for (var index in additionalOwners) { <br />&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; var email = new Email(); <br />&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; email.to = additionalOwners[index].email; <br />&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; email.subject = &quot;Owner Notification&quot;; <br />&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; email.body = &quot;Please update current workflow.&quot;; <br />&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; email.send(); <br />}</em></p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p><strong>Item’s additional group owners</strong></p>
<p><em>item.master.groupAdditionalOwners</em> returns an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array" target="_blank">Array</a> of <strong>Group </strong>objects. We could use the same procedure as what we did for the User object above to do the add/remove/clear actions on the group array. The only difference is that we are working on <strong>Group</strong> object instead of <strong>User</strong>. To get a <strong>Group</strong> object we need use <em>Security.loadGroup(&#39;Group Name&#39;)</em>. This function takes the String of group name as input; returns a <strong>Group</strong> object.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Tips</strong></p>
<p>When we are writing script code, we often need to know the user ID for certain user. (The function <em>Security.loadUser(‘UserId’)</em> introduced above is an example.) But to find a user’s ID is a tricky thing, so here is an easy way to get it quickly. You need go to “Users” page first [Administration –&gt; Security –&gt; Users]. Then after clicking the user’s name under the “User Name” column, you will find the user’s ID is hidden in the address of the new window.</p>
<p><a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/.a/6a0120a5728249970b01b8d12b93fa970c-pi"><img alt="Capture" border="0" height="183" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/.a/6a0120a5728249970b01b7c7a22ad6970b-pi" style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="Capture" width="486" /></a></p>
<p>This user’s ID is “A1mMw”. Now you can use <em>Security.loadUser(‘A1mMw’) t</em>o load the <strong>User</strong> object for this user in scripting.</p>
<p>To use the function <em>Security.loadGroup(&#39;Group Name&#39;), </em>we need to know the group name. Finding group name in PLM is very straightforward. In the Groups page [Administration –&gt; Security –&gt; Groups], each of the displayed names under column “Name” is just the input variable you need for that function.</p>

BODY:
<p>Today let’s put spotlight on the item fields. First we will see how to access each field from the <strong>Item</strong> object. Then we will go through all field types and find the corresponding value type in scripting for each of them.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Access Field Value With Field ID</strong>&#0160;</p>
<p>When an item is loaded, all its field properties have been put into it with their <strong>Field ID</strong> as the key. So to access the value of each field, we just need acquire it from the <strong>Item </strong>variable directly using the field ID. For example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>var name = item.NAME;&#0160; // <span style="font-size: xx-small;"><strong>read the value of NAME field from owner item</strong> <br /></span>item.AGE++;&#0160; // <span style="font-size: xx-small;"><strong>increase the value of AGE field in owner item by one</strong></span></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>PLM scripting is case sensitive, and Field IDs are always in upper case, so neither “<em>item.name”</em> nor “<em>item.Age” </em>will work in this example. Field ID is not editable and must be unique to the workspace. It doesn’t have to be the same as the field name. So if you are not sure about the field ID, you can find it in the field edit window. [Administration -&gt; Workspace Manager -&gt; workspace –&gt; Item Details Tab –&gt; Edit a field by click the pencil icon]</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>Field Type vs. Data Value Type</strong></p>
<p>As the above screenshot shows, there are many different field types provided. The different field type has different value type in scripting, and some of the field values are editable but some are read-only. To make things clear I put all these information into below table:</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse: collapse; line-height: normal;" width="476"><colgroup><col style="width: 195pt; mso-width-source: userset; mso-width-alt: 9508;" width="260" /><col style="width: 155pt; mso-width-source: userset; mso-width-alt: 7533;" width="206" /><col style="width: 230pt; mso-width-source: userset; mso-width-alt: 11227;" width="307" /></colgroup>

BODY:
<p>In the previous posts, we had seen different script types and how to trigger scripts from different places in PLM. The next few posts will focus on the code itself. We will see how to use script create an item, update the bill of materials, add a milestone, etc. First of all, let’s start with the most important object in PLM script: <strong><em>Item</em></strong>.</p>
<hr />
<p><em><strong>Item</strong></em> object is the representation of an item in scripting. In each item’s web page, we can easily acquire the relevant information about the item, such as the value in each field, the item’s owner, all the bill of materials, etc. We also can update the item by creating a relationship with another item, performing a workflow action and so on. All of those operations can also be done with <strong><em>Item </em></strong>object in scripting. So <em><strong>Item</strong></em> object will be our next big topic. In the each of coming posts, we will focus on one aspect of this object. In today’s post, I will show you how to load, create, and delete an item.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Load Item: <em>loadItem(dmsId)</em></strong></p>
<p>To load an existing item, we need use the built-in function:<strong><em> loadItem. </em></strong>It takes the item’s DMS ID as the parameter, and returns the corresponding Item object. For example, if we want to load the existing item whose DMS ID is 1234 into a variable called myItem, then this is what we need:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>var myItem = loadItem(1234);</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since every PLM script only can be triggered within an item’s scope, a reserved keyword “<em><strong>item</strong></em>” is used to represent the item which the script is triggered from.&#0160; We can call that item the owner item of the script. In each script, you can assume that the <strong>owner item</strong> the script has been loaded into a variable called “<em><strong>item</strong></em>” for you, so you can use “<em><strong>item</strong></em>” directly to work on the owner item. If you need any other items, then you should use <em><strong>loadItem</strong></em> function.&#0160;</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Create Item: <em>createItem(workspaceId)</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>createItem </em></strong>can be used to create a new item in a certain workspace. The particular workspace should be specified using the parameter “workspaceId”; the created Item object will be returned. This “workspaceId” is not the numerical workspace identity, but the string identity, which can be found in each workspace’s setting page. [Administration -&gt; Workspace Manager -&gt; workspace –&gt; Workspace Settings]. Then you can assign value to each field of the returned item variable, which will be saved into this new item.&#0160;</p>
<p><a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/.a/6a0120a5728249970b01b7c78b3a98970b-pi"><img alt="Capture" border="0" height="193" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/.a/6a0120a5728249970b01b7c78b3a9e970b-pi" style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;" title="Capture" width="462" /></a></p>
<p>For example, to create an item in workspace “Project”:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>var newItem = createItem(“WS_PROJECT”);<br /></em><em>newItem.NAME = “PLM”;&#0160; &#0160; // <span style="font-size: 8pt;">set String value to a Text field</span><br /></em><em>newItem.STARTDATE = new Date();&#0160; &#0160; // <span style="font-size: 8pt;">set Date value to the Date field</span></em></p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p><strong>Delete Item: <em>item.deleteItem()</em></strong></p>
<p>To delete the owner item of the script, we only need call the delete function from the owner item:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>item.deleteItem();</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To delete other item, we need load the item first, and then delete it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>var itemToDelete = loadItem(1234);<br /></em><em>itemToDelete.deletetItem();</em></p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
</blockquote>

BODY:
<p><span style="font-size: small;">To make scripting easier, <strong>library script</strong> type is introduced in PLM. </span>Today let&#39;s finish the Script Type topic by talking about it.</p>
<p>Library script is meant to contain utility functions that can be used in any other type of scripts just by importing it. So more reusing, less repeating. Let’s create an example of sending out email using library script:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Create library script</strong></p>
<p>Create a library script called EmailUtils with a function which can send email to the received recipients:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>function sendEmailTo(recipients) { <br />&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; var email = new Email(); <br />&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; email.subject = &quot;Email subject&quot;; <br />&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; email.body = &quot;Email body. &lt;br&gt;Supporting HTML formatting.&lt;br&gt;&quot;; <br />&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; email.to = recipients; <br />&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; email.send(); <br />}</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/.a/6a0120a5728249970b01b8d1064489970c-pi"><img alt="Capt1ure" border="0" height="295" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/.a/6a0120a5728249970b01b8d106448d970c-pi" style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;" title="Capt1ure" width="475" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Import library script</strong></p>
<p>Create an action script that imports the EmailUtils and call the “sendEmailTo” function. <strong>To import library script</strong>, just click the “plus” icon in the <strong>Imports</strong> field, and pick a library script from the list. Multiple libraries can be imported by repeating the action. Our action script “NotifyUsers” will generate a recipient list and feed it into the library function:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>var myRecipients = &quot;recipient1@mail.com, recipient2@mail.com&quot;; <br />sendEmailTo(myRecipients);</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/.a/6a0120a5728249970b01b8d1064491970c-pi"><img alt="Captur2e" border="0" height="136" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/.a/6a0120a5728249970b01b7c77cbca1970b-pi" style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;" title="Captur2e" width="478" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Fire the action script</strong></p>
<p>Fire the action script “NotifyUsers” as an on-create, on-edit, on-demand, workflow or scheduled script. Your choice!</p>
<p>The sent email will seems like this.</p>
<p><a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/.a/6a0120a5728249970b01bb0820c250970d-pi"><img alt="Capture" border="0" height="193" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/.a/6a0120a5728249970b01b7c77cbca5970b-pi" style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;" title="Capture" width="491" /></a></p>

BODY:
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Four action script triggers (on-create, on-edit, on-demand and workflow) were introduced in the post on </span><a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2015/03/script-types-action-script-and-triggers.html" style="font-size: small;" target="_self">action script type</a><span style="font-size: small;">. There is another trigger: </span><strong>scheduled script</strong><span style="font-size: small;">, which is a subtle but very useful feature. Now let&#39;s walk through it to round off all the action script triggers.</span></p>
<p>Scheduled Workflow Action Script, as its name suggested, is an action script which is scheduled to run on a workflow state. For each workflow state in PLM, an action can be set up to perform after the configured number of days since the state is entered. Running an action script is one of the optional actions. To set up a scheduled script for a workflow state, go to: [Administration -&gt; Workspace Manager -&gt; workspace –&gt; Workflow Editor -&gt; double click a state -&gt; Escalation tab]. After enabling the escalation, configure when the escalated action will be triggered (must be in Integer days). In our case, we select “Run a script” as the type so that we are able to arrange an action script.</p>
<p><a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/.a/6a0120a5728249970b01b8d105fd52970c-pi"><img alt="Capture" border="0" height="399" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/.a/6a0120a5728249970b01bb08207024970d-pi" style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="Capture" width="452" /></a></p>
<p>Three noteworthy things about this feature:</p>
<ul>
<li>After the scheduled script is triggered, it won’t be rescheduled again until the workflow state is re-entered.</li>
<li>The scheduled script is usually used to notify certain users about current workflow state, automatically move the workflow forward and so on. But again, it is your script, so all up to you.</li>
<li>Don’t expect the timer offering a second accuracy, so this feature is not for firing a rocket.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the last post, we talked about action script. Today, let&#39;s focus on the other two types of scripts: <strong>condition</strong> and <strong>validation scripts</strong>.</p>
<p>Unlike action scripts, both condition and validation scripts only serve workflow transitions.&#0160; The workflow transition properties is the only place to setup the references to them.

<h3><strong>Condition scripts</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Condition scripts are read-only scripts. The changes made in code won&#39;t be saved.</li>
<li>A condition script needs to return a Boolean value (true or false) using predefined function<em> returnValue()</em>.</li>
<li>The returned value is used to tell whether an outgoing workflow transition from current state is available to the user to perform or not, but it is not the only prerequisite to make a transition available. The user must also have the workflow permission of the transition.</li>
<li>Condition scripts are triggered whenever PLM needs to determine if a workflow transition is available to a user.</li>
<li>Each transition can only have one condition script.</li>
<li>Each condition script can be referred by multiple transitions from different workspaces.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Condition script examples</strong></h3>
<p>Example 1: Transition is only available to the owner of item.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>// <span style="font-size: 10pt;"><strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">get current item&#39;s owner</span></strong>.</span></em><br /><em><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> var owner = item.master.owner; </span></em><br /><em> // <strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">if the owner&#39;s id is equal to the current user&#39;s id, then return true; otherwise false.</span></strong></em><br /><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><em> returnValue(owner.id === userID ? true : false);</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Example 2: Transition is only available to the users in &quot;Admin Group&quot;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>// <span style="font-size: 8pt;"><strong>Security.inGroup(userId, groupName) is built-in function checking if certain user is in certain group.</strong></span></em><br /><em> var isCurrentUserInAdminGroup = Security.inGroup(userID, &#39;Admin Group&#39;); </em><br /><em> // <span style="font-size: 8pt;"><strong>return the checking result</strong></span></em><br /><em> returnValue(isCurrentUserInAdminGroup);</em></p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/.a/6a0120a5728249970b01b8d0fca9f2970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="6a0120a5728249970b01bb080cebf1970d-800wi" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0120a5728249970b01b8d0fca9f2970c image-full img-responsive" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/.a/6a0120a5728249970b01b8d0fca9f2970c-800wi" title="6a0120a5728249970b01bb080cebf1970d-800wi" /></a></p>
<h3><strong>Validation script</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Validation scripts are also read-only.&#0160; The changes made in code won&#39;t be saved.</li>
<li>A validation script is used to validate certain prerequisites before allowing transitioning to the next workflow state.</li>
<li>A validation script should return an array of failing messages using predefined function<em> returnValue()</em>.</li>
<li>The transitioning will be allowed if an empty array is received; otherwise, the user won&#39;t be allowed to perform the transitioning and the returned messages will be shown to the user.</li>
<li>Each transition can only have one validation script.</li>
<li>Each validation script can be referred by multiple transitions from different workspaces.</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>Validation script example</strong></h3>
<p>Example: Item&#39;s &quot;name&quot; field must not be empty, and item must have an attachment at least.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><em>var messages = [];</em></span><br /><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><em> if (item.NAME === null) {&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;// <span style="font-size: 8pt;"><strong>name field must not be empty</strong></span></em></span><br /><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><em> &#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;messages.push(&quot;Production&#39;s name is required to complete the transition&quot;);</em></span><br /><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><em> }</em></span><br /><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><em> if (item.attachments.length === 0) {&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;// <span style="font-size: 8pt;"><strong>must have one attachment at least</strong></span></em></span><br /><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><em> &#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;messages.push(&quot;At least one attachment is required to complete the transition&quot;);</em></span><br /><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><em> }</em></span><br /><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><em> returnValue(messages);</em></span></p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/.a/6a0120a5728249970b01bb0816fe2d970d-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="6a0120a5728249970b01bb080cebf1970d-800wi" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0120a5728249970b01bb0816fe2d970d image-full img-responsive" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/.a/6a0120a5728249970b01bb0816fe2d970d-800wi" title="6a0120a5728249970b01bb080cebf1970d-800wi" /></a></p>
<h3><strong>Scripts in workflow transition lifecycle</strong></h3>
<p>Here is how all 3 script types are used in a workflow transition:</p>
<ol>
<li>Every <strong>condition script</strong> on the outgoing transitions of current workflow state runs to determine which transitions are available for the current user.</li>
<li>User chooses an available transition to perform workflow action.</li>
<li>The <strong>validation script</strong> for that transition runs to validate all the prerequisites.</li>
<li>If all the prerequisites are met, the <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2015/03/script-types-action-script-and-triggers.html" target="_self"><strong>action script</strong></a> on that transition runs.</li>
<li>The transition is completed.</li>
</ol>

<p>PLM Scripting supports three types of scripts: action, condition, validation. In this post, let’s focus on the <strong>action script</strong> and its triggers.</p>
<p>Action scripts can be used to create items, edit item field values, update bill of materials, perform workflow transitions and so on. In my previous post, the script we created for the <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2015/03/plm-scripting-hello-world.html" target="_self">Hello World example</a> is an action script used to update an item’s title to “Hello World”. An action script can be divided into on-create script, on-edit script, on-demand script, and workflow script according to how it is triggered.</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/.a/6a0120a5728249970b01b8d0f27c6d970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Untitled" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0120a5728249970b01b8d0f27c6d970c image-full img-responsive" height="5" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/.a/6a0120a5728249970b01b8d0f27c6d970c-800wi" style="width: 1792px;" title="Untitled" /></a></p>
<h3>Four kinds of action scripts</h3>
<h4><strong>On-create script:</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>A on-create script will be triggered after an item is created (by either UI or a script).</li>
<li>A workspace can only have one on-create script.</li>
<li>An action script can be assigned to multiple workspaces as the on-create script.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>On-edit script:</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>A on-edit script will be triggered after any field value of an item (under Item Details tab) is modified.</li>
<li>The changes made on the other tabs (Project Management, Relationships…) won’t trigger on-edit script.</li>
<li>A workspace can only have one on-edit script.</li>
<li>An action script can be assigned to multiple workspaces as the on-edit script.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>On-demand script: </strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>An on-demand script will be triggered by clicking the script icon in item’s page.</li>
<li>The script icon is available only if the current item is not locked (which means there are workflow actions available for the current user).</li>
<li>One workspace can only have multiple on-demand scripts.</li>
<li>An action script can be assigned to multiple workspaces as on-demand script.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Workflow script:</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>A workflow action script will be triggered when a workflow action is performed on the transition which the script is assigned.</li>
<li>A workflow transition can only have one workflow action script.</li>

Action scripts can be used to create items, edit item field values, update bill of materials, perform workflow transitions and so on. In my previous post, the script we created for the Hello World example is an action script used to update an item’s title to “Hello World”. An action script can be divided into on-create script, on-edit script, on-demand script, and workflow script according to how it is triggered.

BODY:
<p>Hi, I&#39;m Michal Liu, a developer on PLM 360. I will be showing you how to get the most out of PLM scripting.</p>
<p>PLM 360 scripting is a JavaScript-influenced language, which is customized to work with PLM. It gives users ability to extend the core functionalities or customize them to achieve various business goals. The language is designed for every user, not just for veteran programmers. If you do have some programming background, it will help you to grasp JavaScript quickly.&#0160; However, if your programming background is zero, you will still be able to write some simple but pragmatic code by reading the &quot;Help Guide&quot;. Other than the guide, you also can get the help from <a href="http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/plm-360-general-discussion/bd-p/705" target="_blank">PLM 360 General Discussion</a> forum and this blog.</p>
<p>As this is my first post, I am going to walk through the process to create and run a simple script code. In future posts, I will dive into some topics like script types, triggers, script chain, programming tabs and so on. For now, let&#39;s just build a &quot;hello world&quot; code.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You need to be logged in as an administrator, otherwise you won&#39;t be able to create scripts.</li>
<li>Make sure you have a workspace <strong>W</strong> having a &quot;Single Line Text&quot; field named &quot;Title&quot;.</li>
<li>You also need &quot;Edit Items&quot; permission for workspace <strong>W</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 1: Write some code</strong></p>
<p>To create a script code, you need go to Administration -&gt; System Configuration -&gt; Scripting -&gt; click &quot;New Script&quot; button on the top left of the page.</p>
<ul>
<li>Leave &quot;Script Type&quot; as default type &quot;Action&quot;.</li>
<li>Give it a &quot;Unique Name&quot;. e.g. <strong>myActionScript</strong>. (The unique name must be between 3 and 50 characters.)</li>
<li>You can leave the &quot;Description&quot;, &quot;Imports&quot; and &quot;Enable Code Complete&quot; as they are for now.</li>
<li>Put the below text into &quot;Code&quot; and click Save button.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 30px;">&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; <em>&#0160;&#0160; item.TITLE = &quot;Hello World&quot;;</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img alt="PLMScriptHelloWorld_scriptCode" border="0" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2015/ScriptHelloWorld/ScriptEditor.png" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Step 2: Configure the script into workspace W</strong></p>
<p>Go to Administration -&gt; Workspace Manager -&gt;<strong> W</strong> -&gt; Behaviors. Select &quot;myActionScript&quot; for &quot;Script to run on demand&quot;. After the selection, another row of &quot;Script to run on demand&quot; pops up. It&#39;s okay. Click Save.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Run the script</strong></p>
<p>Go to an item&#39;s page from workspace <strong>W</strong>. Click the script icon; click Confirm in the popped up dialog.</p>
<p><br /><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/.a/6a0120a5728249970b01b7c760b96f970b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="PLMScriptHelloWorld_workspaceBar" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0120a5728249970b01b7c760b96f970b img-responsive" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/.a/6a0120a5728249970b01b7c760b96f970b-800wi" style="margin-left: auto; display: block; margin-right: auto;" title="PLMScriptHelloWorld_workspaceBar" /></a>If everything are correct so far. You will see a green bar saying &quot;Operation completed successfully&quot;, and now the Title field will be changed to &quot;Hello World&quot;.</p>

I'm still here, but my current product doesn't have a public API.  That's why I haven't been posting much on Vault lately; I'm not on that product anymore.  I'm hoping to find a developer on the Vault team to post new content.

In the meantime, ADN posts Vault articles on their blog:  <a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/manufacturing/vault/">http://adndevblog.typepad.com/manufacturing/vault/</a>

<p>If you want to update a Vault property and that property is mapped to a value within the file, you have a couple of options, and they both suck.&#0160; This post is to introduce a third, and non-sucky, option in Vault 2015 R2.&#0160; Again, I’ll be using the <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2015/01/2-undocumented-functions.html" target="_blank">previously undocumented functions</a> from Copy Design.</p>
<p>Sucky option 1 is to checkout and download the CAD file.&#0160; Next, use the appropriate CAD API to update the file on disk.&#0160; Lastly, check the file back in to Vault.&#0160; What makes this option so difficult is that you need to involve the CAD API.&#0160; It would be nice to do just everything from within the Vault API.</p>
<p>Sucky option 2 is to use IExplorerUtil.UpdateFileProperties in the Vault API.&#0160; On paper, this is a great function.&#0160; It loads up core pieces of Vault Explorer libraries and executes the Edit Properties command just as if a user had done it through the UI.&#0160; It even handles the checkout/checkin.&#0160; The problem is that it’s a bulky operation and prone to failure.&#0160; Vault Explorer simply wasn’t meant to be invoked from the API.&#0160;&#0160;IExplorerUtil was always indented to be a temporary solution until something better came along.&#0160; And that something better is here....</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #d09219;" />
<p>The new option is to use the Copy Design features.&#0160; Similar to how you can <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2015/02/roll-your-own-copy-design.html" target="_blank">‘roll your own’ copy design</a>, you can also run a property update without ever invoking a CAD API or downloading the file.&#0160; It’s a 4 step process:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Check out the file</strong> <br />DocumentService.CheckoutFile(...)</p>
<p>This step reserves the file to you for editing.&#0160; It also gives you a download ticket, which you will need in the next 2 steps.&#0160; Although you are not actually downloading anything, the ticket is the currency that the FilestoreService uses.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Read the property definitions from the file</strong> <br />FilestoreService.GetContentSourcePropertyDefinitions(...)</p>
<p>This step interrogates the binary file and pulls out the names properties that you may be able to edit.&#0160; Unfortunately, it doesn’t tell you the current values on those properties.&#0160; Also keep in mind that this is the property as it appears in the file, which may not be the same name that it appears in Vault.&#0160; In fact, it may not be mapped to a Vault property at all.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:&#0160; Copy the binary contents file <br /></strong>FilestoreService.CopyFile(...)</p>
<p>This step will create a new binary blob of data in the Vault filestore.&#0160; It also lets you update properties on that blob.&#0160; The ‘writeReqs’ parameter let’s you pass in new values for the properties you discovered in part 2.&#0160; Only properties you pass in are updated.&#0160; All others are left with their existing value.&#0160; <br />It’s possible that not all properties you supplied will get updated, so check the ‘writeResults’ out parameter for confirmation.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Check-in the file</strong> <br />DocumentService.CheckinUploadedFile(...)</p>
<p>This steps ties the binary data in the filestore with actual records in the Vault database.&#0160; Without this step, you just have a blob of data floating in limbo.&#0160; Although you copied binary data, it won&#39;t be used for creating a new File Master like with copy design.&#0160; Instead, you are creating a new version of an existing file.&#0160; From the filestore’s point of view, there is no difference between the two.&#0160; Both are just blobs of binary data.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #d09219;" />
<p><strong>Sample Code</strong></p>
<p>You didn’t think I would go through all this without providing any sample code, did you?&#0160; Not a chance.&#0160; I actually have an mini app that illustrates this workflow and the a simple Copy Design workflow from the previous post.&#0160; Includes C# and VB.NET source code. Enjoy.</p>

Hi Doug

It is nice way to update fileproperties, but it is again only a half solution. I only want to put in the vault properties i have to change for an specific object and that's it. I' dont want to care about all the things around the object. In my opinion an API has to simplify all the complicated things behind the scene.

Could you explain the next step, how to fix the file references?
In my example, I would like to copy both the model, and the drawing, that are associated with an item. So, using your code, I can copy both files, and promote the new file to an item. But, how do I link the new drawing to the new model file?

Thanks for all your help,
Shane

So you basically want your own version of Copy Design.  Have a look at this article:  <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2015/02/roll-your-own-copy-design.html">http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2015/02/roll-your-own-copy-design.html</a>

In the last step, AddUploadedFile(..), is where you specify the references to any child files.  You will need to look at the relationships of the original files and make sure to set things up the same way for the new files. 
At that point you should be good.  Internal references are fixed up on download.  So when you call AcquireFiles, the Vault framework will edit your local copy to point to the new file.

Hi Doug,

Great demo here, it helped me through most of a migration though I find myself stuck. I'm not as experienced with the Vault APIs as I would like to be so I think I might be missing a trick. Two questions:

1) When going through the code above you handle properties that already exist on the file. I notice that there is an option for "CanCreate" and I imagine that if set to true it would create this property on the file. The problem being that I don't know where to get the Moniker from for a property that exists in Vault SQL but not yet in the File. I found a previous article that talks about debugging and hard coding these values though I would much prefer a dynamic way of getting this information. I have an inkling that the file's source API (Inventor in this case) might be the answer that I don't want to hear. Is there a Vault API way to do this?

2) The method you present here and the method I have been shown to implement is to check a file out, mod it's properties then check the file back in. Assuming you allow bi-directional updating between mapped properties the method above (and previously DocumentService.UpdateFileProperties(...)) works, assuming that the property already exists on the File. What I was thinking is that it must be more straightforward to update the Vault SQL properties then sync them to the file, telling the Vault to create the properties if they don't exist. If there are already good examples of this that I have been unable to find then I would greatly welcome links and references. On the contrary side there might be a good article somewhere that explains why this is not the case. 

Whatever the outcome might be, any and all help will be greatly appreciated.

Jake

1. Have a look at these articles if you haven't already.
For some background on how "Vault SQL" properties and file properties work:  <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2010/06/properties-in-vault-2011---part-2.html">http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2010/06/properties-in-vault-2011---part-2.html</a>

For sample code on finding the moniker:
<a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2010/07/properties-in-vault-2011---part-4.html">http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2010/07/properties-in-vault-2011---part-4.html</a>


2)  Are you talking about unmapped properties?  Properties that just live in Vault and not the file?  Yes, those are easier to update.  You can just call DocumentService.UpdateFileProperties on the files.  No need to download or copy the file.   However, I think you still need to checkout/checkin the file.

Hi Doug,

Thanks for your answers. I looked through the posts that you linked with a clearer head and noticed that I was using the PropDef class rather than the PropDefInfo class which was the reason I could only get limited information compared with the examples in the post about Monikers. 

I tried to implement this with some success but I tripped up over the creation of a Vault property in a file that does not yet have the matching, mapped property (This was caused by a new property being added through further API development some years after the first release. New files always worked as required but old files needed the property adding in order to work). I found that I could not use the "CanCreate" variable to force the creation of the missing property to the point where I received an error from the server. I'm not sure what the error was, I only know that if I set CanCreate to true for any property that did not exist on the file then it would cause an exception. 

After all of this I started to think over your comments about using DocumentService.UpdateFileProperties(). The reason I was doing any of this was because of the removal of the version of UpdateFileProperties that was previously being used. Following this through further I realised that I had misunderstood the newer version that uses PropInstParamArray[] as a variable. Once I followed this through and tweaked my Vault property settings everything was working again. 

In conclusion its working. Thanks again for your help and for all of the outstanding blog posts.

Jake

Jake, did you end up having to check the file in and out to update the property values? I've found I can create and remove propdefs on dwgs without having to check in and check out, but it throws an error when Itrying to check the file back in. The strange thing is, if I stop debugging after it has checked the file out and updated the values, but BEFORE trying to check the file back in,  the vault shows the file as checked out WITH the new values. .. I end up having to check the file back in with admin privileges. Any help is definitely appreciated. Vault Mechanical  2015 R2, by the way...

<p><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/Vault4.png" /> <br /><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/TipsAndTricks4.png" /></p>
<p><a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2015/01/2-undocumented-functions.html">Previously</a>, I documented two new functions related to the new Copy Design app in Vault 2015 R2.&#0160; Now I would like to explore some uses for those functions.&#0160; The most obvious usage is to build your own Copy Design algorithm that meets your specific needs.</p>
<p>Technically, a custom Copy Design as always possible in Vault, but these new functions make things easier.&#0160; Most significantly, your app does not have to engage in any CAD-specific APIs.&#0160; Assuming, of course, the CAD file is one of the types that Vault recognizes.&#0160;</p>
<p>I said that the new functions make a custom Copy Design easi<em><strong>er</strong></em>, but it’s still not something I would describe as simple.&#0160; You still have to manage things like file relationships, and file naming.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #d09219;" />
<p>For each file you want to copy, you basically have to do three steps:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:&#0160; Get a download ticket. <br /></strong>DocumentService.GetDownloadTicketsByFileIds(...)</p>
<p>You are not actually downloading anything, but let’s not worry about that for the moment.&#0160; The important thing is that we are swapping the File Id for ticket, and the ticket is required in step 2.&#0160;</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:&#0160; Copy the binary file contents.</strong> <br />FilestoreService.CopyFile(...)</p>
<p>This step will do a server-side copy of the file bits.&#0160; Nothing is actually download or uploaded from your computer.&#0160; The operation just does a copy of the <em>binary data</em>.&#0160; The <em>meta data</em> still has not been copied yet, so it doesn’t really exist in Vault.&#0160; It has no file name, no folder location, no create time, and so on.&#0160; It’s basically a set of data floating in limbo.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:&#0160; Add the file to Vault</strong> <br />DocumentService.AddUploadedFile(...)</p>
<p>This step is where you tell the Vault database about the file.&#0160; It’s here that you set the new name, new location, and new relationships for the copied file.&#0160; Again, the function name isn’t technically correct.&#0160; We didn’t upload the file, but this function doesn’t care.&#0160; It just needs an uploadTicket so that it can cement the binary data to the meta data.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #d09219;" />
<p>Another key aspect of the copy is that the internal file relationships have not yet been modified.&#0160; Step 2 is a perfect copy, so it still has pointers to old file names.&#0160; Vault is designed so that <strong>file relationships are updated when the file is downloaded</strong>.&#0160; This is another reason you want to use AcquireFiles when downloading.&#0160; It fixes up the references for your local files.</p>
<p>The new copy design app works the same way.&#0160; It relies on download to fix up and broken references.&#0160; Those references will technically stay broken until an engineer checks out the files, makes changes and checks the files back in.</p>

Previously, I documented two new functions related to the new Copy Design app in Vault 2015 R2.  Now I would like to explore some uses for those functions.  The most obvious usage is to build your own Copy Design algorithm that meets your specific needs.

I hope someone does. It wouldn't be hard to improve on the UX of the New Copy Design tool. The UI on that thing is a pig. Unfortunately.

Vault API doesn't have proper documentations and examples. And there are a bunch of hints here and there.
It is like, Autodesk Vault doesn't want any programming to be done and still they had to do have a few pages;so, reluctantly they have created a weblog any ways.

Would you be able to post a sample code for the copy design.
The routine as is explained here is not very clear.
A sample project or sample code will be appreciated.

<p>There are some undocumented functions in Vault 2015 R2 I’d like to tell you about.&#0160; Of course, the process of me telling you about them essentially makes them documented.&#0160; So by the time you get to the bottom of this article, the title becomes untrue.&#0160;</p>
<p>Yes, I did get permission from the team before going public with this information.&#0160; So feel free to use the knowledge that I am about to impart upon you as long as you are in Vault 2015 R2.&#0160; In fact, I’ll be going into more details in the upcoming posts on how you can use these functions to do cool things.&#0160; But first, some background.</p>
<p>You know that <a href="http://help.autodesk.com/view/VAULT/2015/ENU/?guid=GUID-E4C6B707-448D-467E-B7FD-00625A98B791">new Copy Design</a> app in 2015 R2?&#0160; It’s more than just a UI redesign.&#0160; There are some server side enhancements too.&#0160; Specifically the copy happens entirely on the server side.&#0160; Previously, the client would download all the files, copy them, modify the copies and upload them as new files.&#0160; The new mechanism saves network bandwidth and reduces the load on the client.&#0160; But in order to develop the new Copy Design client, some new server APIs needed to be made...</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #d09219;" />
<p><strong>CopyFile</strong></p>
<p>This function copies the binary contents of a file in the filestore.&#0160; The Vault meta data, such as Name and Version Number, are <strong>not</strong> copied.</p>
<p><em>byte[] FilestoreService.CopyFile ( <br />&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; byte[] downloadTicket, <br />&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; bool allowSync, <br />&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; PropWriteReq[] writeReqs,&#0160; <br />&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; out PropWriteResults writeResults)</em></p>
<p><strong>downloadTicket</strong> – The identifier to the file you want to copy. The FilestoreService doesn’t care about File.Id values. Download/upload tickets are the identifiers here.&#0160; Call DocumentService.GetDownloadTicketsByFileIds to get a download ticket.</p>
<p><strong>allowSync</strong> – If true and the file is not on the local filestore, the file is copied as part of the operation. If false, the operation fails if the file is not in the local filestore.</p>
<p><strong>writeReqs</strong> – A set of properties to update within the file. For example, you can update Inventor iProperties in the copied file.</p>
<p><strong>writeResults</strong> – The result of the property updates.&#0160; Just because you <em>requested</em> a property change, doesn’t mead the change actually happened.</p>
<p><strong>Return value</strong> – The upload ticket for the new file.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #d09219;" />
<p><strong>GetContentSourcePropertyDefinitions</strong></p>
<p>This function gets you the list of property names contained within the file.&#0160; The CAD file is the <em>source</em> of the <em>content</em>.&#0160; This type of property is different than Vault properties, which are stored in the Vault database.&#0160;</p>
<p><em>CtntSrcPropDef[] FilestoreService.GetContentSourcePropertyDefinitions ( <br />&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; byte[] downloadTicket, <br />&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; bool allowSync)</em></p>
<p><strong>downloadTicket</strong> – The identifier for the file to read property names from. Call DocumentService.GetDownloadTicketsByFileIds to get a download ticket.</p>
<p><strong>allowSync</strong> – If true and the file is not on the local filestore, the file is copied as part of the operation. If false, the operation fails if the file is not in the local filestore.</p>
<p><strong>Return value</strong> – The properties that may be read from or written to in the file.</p>

Hi Doug,

So if I understand you well you can make your own Copy Design?

I can’t wait for the upcoming posts this it will be very interesting.

<p>In the Vault 2015 R2 release, the old Item lifecycle engine was replaced with the entity-based engine used by Files and Folders.&#0160; The good news is that the entity-based engine is filled with awesome features to make your Items more useful.&#0160; The bad news is that you have to update your code.</p>
<p>If you already know how to change File Lifecycle States, then you pretty much know how to change Item Lifecycle States.&#0160; This article is geared mostly to those that use Items but are not familiar with the File/Folder lifecycle engine.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #d09219;" />
<p><strong>Step 1:&#0160; Figuring out the States and Transitions</strong></p>
<p>In Vault 2015 and earlier, it was easy to know the possible Item states and transitions because they were hard coded.&#0160; There were only 4 states and they were all connected.&#0160; In 2015 R2, the administrator can define their own states and transitions.&#0160; They can even define multiple lifecycle definitions.&#0160; For example, one Item may be in the “Engineering Release Process” while another is in the “Document Approval Process”.&#0160;</p>
<p>So your app has to figure out what the states and transitions are.&#0160; The Item itself knows what Lifecycle State it is in.&#0160; But to get more context about the surrounding States you need to go to the <strong>LifeCycleService</strong>.&#0160; Not only can you find out about all the states and transitions, you can also update them if you have admin rights.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #d09219;" />
<p><strong>Step 2:&#0160; Updating the Item object</strong></p>
<p>The LifeCycleService does everything at the <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2011/09/entities-and-behaviors.html">Entity</a> level.&#0160; If you want to modify the Item itself, you need to go to the ItemService.&#0160; When changing the state on an Item, you will use one of two functions...</p>
<p><strong>UpdateItemLifeCycleStates</strong> is the function to use when moving an Item from one state to another within a lifecycle definition.&#0160; For example, when moving from “Released” to “Quick Change”.</p>
<p><strong>UpdateItemLifeCycleDefinitions</strong> is the function to use when moving an Item to a different lifecycle entirely.&#0160; For example, when moving from “Flexible Release Process” to “Item Release Process”.</p>
<p>The nice thing about both functions is that they are one-shot functions.&#0160; No need to call EditItems prior or UpdateAndCommitItems afterward.&#0160; Everything happens in a single call.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #d09219;" />
<p><strong>Sample code:</strong></p>
<p>Here is a quick sample app you can use to see how it all comes together.&#0160; Both C# and VB.NET code are included.</p>

<p>I may be exaggerating slightly when I say that <strong>the Quick Change state on Items is the greatest invention mankind has ever or will ever achieve</strong>. The bad news is that it’s only available for Vault 2015 R2.&#0160; But that’s also a good thing, because once you start using it, there is no going back.&#0160; You are changed forever.</p>
<p><a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2014/QuickChange/quickChange.png" target="_blank"><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2014/QuickChange/quickChange_scaled.png" /></a><br /><span style="color: #888888;">(click for full size image)</span></p>
<p>If you are wondering why I am so excited about the Quick Change state, then you probably have never tried programming with Items in the Vault.&#0160; In Vault 2015 and earlier, the lifecycle states are rigidly defined, which made it really difficult to perform operations on a Released item.&#0160; And 99% of the time, Released Items are the only type of Items your app cares about.</p>
<p>Take this scenario.&#0160; You are writing an app that pushes Item data to an ERP system automatically when an Item gets released.&#0160; You when the new entry gets created in the ERP system, you would like to save that ERP object ID on the Vault Item.&#0160; But Vault won&#39;t let you, it’s released, which means it’s read only.&#0160; Your app needs to find a way to move the Item to WIP without bumping the revision.&#0160; Then, it needs a way to move back to Released without triggering the update again.&#0160; It’s possible, but it’s a pain.</p>
<p>Quick change fixes all of that.&#0160; Your app can safely move in and out of the Released state without worrying about a revision bump.&#0160; The permissions are configurable, so you can guarantee that nobody will mess with the Item while your app is editing it.</p>
<p>Even outside the context of custom programming, Quick Change is useful.&#0160; If you are a Vault admin and you notice a small detail that needs fixing, you can, um, quickly change it.&#0160; Files have had the Quick Change state for years now.&#0160; It’s still highly useful for Files, but I think it will be even more useful for the Item world.&#0160;</p>
<p>When you upgrade to Vault 2015 R2, Quick Change is automatically added.&#0160; If, for some strange reason, you don’t want it, you can always just delete it from the Vault settings dialog.&#0160; If you hear loud sobbing while you delete it, that’s just me.&#0160; I hate to see a good lifecycle state die.</p>
<p>I’ll leave you with an clip from the movie Quick Change.&#0160; That&#39;s right, the Quick Change state is so awesome that Hollywood made a movie about it 24 years before it was invented.&#0160; If you are a Bill Murray fan and have not seen the move, then you are not actually a Bill Murray fan.</p>

<p>If you are not already aware, Vault 2015 R2 has a BOM Report feature.&#0160; From any BOM view, you can run the Report command to generate a report of the BOM that you are viewing.&#0160; This report uses the same engine as File and Folder reports, which has a good deal of customization options.&#0160; There are also default templates to help you get started quickly.</p>

<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>However, the out-of-the-box BOM Report feature is a manual process.&#0160; If you want to automate things, my plug-in hooks to job server and lets you trigger reports when items change state.&#0160; When the job runs, it generates the report, saves it to Vault as a PDF and attaches it to the item.</p>

<p>All the apps on this blog have a <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/disclaimer.html">legal disclaimer</a> on them, but I want to make this one more obvious since it’s dealing with BOM data.&#0160; <strong>BOM Report Job is not an official product.</strong>&#0160; It’s technically classified as a sample app.&#0160; So please keep that in mind when dealing with these reports.&#0160; For example, if you are using the report to purchase $50,000 worth of parts, you may want to double check the numbers first before putting the order in.&#0160;</p>

Stunning!! Can you get it to generate a row per quantity now?? So if there are Qty 3 components, you can get it to report 3 line items? I've wanted to use Vault to generate component labels with barcodes for a long time. I'm really hoping this change supports that.

2015 R2 has a "grouping" feature that lets you show multiple rows for different instances of the same part.  If you can see that in the BOM view, then the BOM Report should be able to give you the same view.

If you want a BOM Report that looks different than what you see in Vault Explorer, then this app will not do that.  However, the source code is available, as usual.  So you can program your own type of BOM view.

Excellent. Thanks Doug. In think it will need to be different because the grouping is fixed to match the grouping in the inventor BOM I believe. I didn't realize they could be different via the API.

Hi Doug
 Is this BOM Generation is same as inventor API BOM Export to CSV file using following call.

 var bom = assemblyDoc.ComponentDefinition.BOM;
bom.BOMViews["Structured"].Export(csvFilePath, FileFormatEnum.kTextFileCommaDelimitedFormat);

can we use vault API for generating BOM and exporting it to csv.
thanks

Normally I don't include VB.NET examples because there are web sites you can go to that do the conversion automatically.  
But in this case, I included the app in an AU class, and built a VB.NET example for it.  You can find it in the Additional Materials download of my AU class: <a href="http://au.autodesk.com/au-online/classes-on-demand/class-catalog/2014/vault/sd5329">http://au.autodesk.com/au-online/classes-on-demand/class-catalog/2014/vault/sd5329</a>

Hi Doug,

I am trying to get this sample to work in 2016. The JobExtension class contains a function 'ReadBOMData' that uses a web method 'GetLastestItemInRevisionByItemId'. This method doesn't seem to be available in 2016 anymore and the API help doesn't give information about the 2016 equivalent. Which method should be used in 2016?

Here is the answer I got back from the Vault team:  "GetLatestItemByItemMasterId would be my guess."

If that doesn't work, I suggest logging an ADN ticket.  Sorry about that.

<p>Warning: A new version of Vault has been released to Subscription Center.&#0160; For the first time in many years, the Vault team put out a full release in between the standard yearly releases.&#0160; R2 is not a service pack, which is why you need to be careful.</p>
<p>If you are installing for the first time, R2 is a good enough starting point.&#0160; But if you are already running Vault in production, you will probably want to wait until Vault 2016.&#0160; Upgrading to R2 is only for those who need the new features <strong>right now</strong>.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2014/Vault2015R2/installWarning.png" style="float: none; margin-left: auto; display: block; margin-right: auto;" /><em><span style="color: #666666;">You thought I was joking about the warning?&#0160; This is actual UI from the installer.</span></em></p>
<p>As usual, I’ll stick to the API-related stuff and leave it to other blogs to go over the end-user feature set.&#0160; There is a pretty good overview over at <a href="http://designandmotion.net/autodesk/vault/autodesk-vault-2015-r2-summary/" target="_blank">Design and Motion</a>.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #ff0000;" />
<p><strong>Vault 2015 R2 technical details:</strong> <br />Just like with any other full release, 2015 R2 has it’s own SDK with its own DLLs and web services.</p>
<ul>
<li>Version number: 20.x.x.x <br /><em>The 2015 release has 19 as the version number.</em></li>
<li>Web service URL path:&#0160; /AutodeskDM/Services/v19.1/ <br /><em>Technically it should be v20 in the path.&#0160; The important part is that it’s different than v19, which is the path to the 2015 web services.</em></li>
<li>Web service compatibility:&#0160; A 2015 R2 server is compatible with the following clients:
<ul>
<li>2015 R2</li>
<li>2015*</li>
<li>2014*</li>
<li>2013*</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>* = No compatibility for Item and Package services.&#0160; Those services are completely disabled.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Package Service disabled for R2.&#0160; Almost every function will return an error.</li>
<li>Plug-in compatibility:&#0160; As usual, plug-ins need to be re-compiled for each version.
<ul>
<li>ApiVersion attribute needs to be set to “8.0”</li>
<li>The .vcet.config files need to reference version “20.0.0.0” of any Vault SDK DLLs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Plug-ins should go in the folder “%ProgramData%\Autodesk\<strong>Vault 2015 R2</strong>\Extensions”</li>
<li>When developing for the Autodesk Exchange app store, “V2015R2” is the value to use for the SeriesMin and SeriesMax values in the package.xml.</li>
<li>Vault Office Client and the full Vault Explorer Client are binary equivalents.&#0160; Any plug-in you write will load in both clients.&#0160; There is no way for your code to detect which client it’s running in.</li>
<li>R2 uses .NET 4.5 and Visual Studio 2012 is still the recommended IDE.&#0160; No change from 2015.</li>
</ul>

Thanks for the D&M mention Doug! Is the package service disabled for R2 as well then?

Correct.  The Package Service, which handles item import/export, is disabled in R2.

Doug,

May you confirm me than the SP1 for 2015 (<a href="http://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/vault-products/downloads/caas/downloads/content/autodesk-vault-2015-service-pack-1-for-autodesk-vault-basic-2015-autodesk-vault-workgroup.html?v=2015)">http://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/vault-products/downloads/caas/downloads/content/autodesk-vault-2015-service-pack-1-for-autodesk-vault-basic-2015-autodesk-vault-workgroup.html?v=2015)</a> is related only for 2015 R1 and not 2015 R2.
Am I right?

Cheers,
-Bertrand

<p>A while back I posted some code showing <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2014/04/assigning-a-file-to-an-item.html" target="_blank">how to create Items from Files</a>.&#0160; This time I’ll post code code showing how to update those Items when you want to consume File changes.&#0160;</p>
<p>The code is almost identical.&#0160; The creating Items from Files and updating Items from Files are actually the same operation under the hood.&#0160; The only difference is how the process gets kicked off.&#0160; When creating Items, you start with a set of Files.&#0160; When updating Items, you start with a set of Items.</p>
<p>Here is the code for the update operation.&#0160; This time around UpdatePromoteComponents kicks off the process.&#0160; Again, this is a very simplified example.&#0160; More complex BOMs may involve more code.</p>

Hi Doug,

I am trying to update an item according to this sample, but with one difference. I need to have the 'autoAssignDuplicates' property in the UpdatePromoteComponents method set to 'true'.

How does the 'autoAssignDuplicates' work? 

We used to have a function 'GetItemDuplicateCandidates', which is removed in Vault 2015, to get to know the possible duplicates. I used this function together with the 'ReassignComponentsToDifferentItems' function to assign the duplicates to the proper item. What can I use in Vault 2015 to get to know more information about the duplicates?

Regards,
Pim Saarloos

Here is the answer I got back from the Vault team...

Since Vault no longer has a wizard, the assign-duplicate functionality is automated.

In the new code, auto assign duplicates = true will attempt to find duplicate items for all bom components and will link them if possible.  If a match is found, the component will be linked to the first candidate.  There is no user/API interaction involved in this decision.

Vault 2015 also auto links all subcomponents and standard components regardless of the flag.  This behavior has been identified as a bug and may be changed in the near future.

Hi Doug,
i have a hybrid scenario that i cannot solve.
In Vault 2015 i have an item without any primary file - an "empty box" created from another external procedure.
The drafter, in Inventor, do the draft and simply Add file in Vault. My extension must link the ipt/iam with the correct item. Here's the problem: your code below does not work in this case. All can i do is AssignFileToItem first, and then UpdateAndCommitItems. In Vault i finally have the File linked with the correct Item, but i don't have the Item preview updated!! To be "all-fine" i must manually go inside the Vault GUI, catch the Item and do the update manually.

Is there a way to do it? In Vault 2013 i made this with the "classic" PromoteFiles - probably with less performance but certainly more powerful as use

Regards,
Dave

In a perfect developer's world, where there is only one duplicate candidate, this might work...

In real world there is a 1/n chance to get the right candidate.

Hi Doug, I was looking for an app that will clean some of my folders with non-referenced files. One problem is that I have Vault WG 2016 and your app is 2015. :(
Do you plan to upgrade your app to 2016 in the near future?
I wonder why Autodesk does not create a command in Vault to just do that. 
Looking forward for your response. Thanks mate.

Sorry, I'm not on the Vault team any more and don't have time to keep all my Vault apps current.  The source code is available, so it's possible that someone will come along and update this app.

<p>Every now and then I write an app only to find out at the end that the app doesn’t work well.&#0160; This is one of those cases.&#0160; I’m going to post the app anyway because I believe the code may be of use to somebody.&#0160; Splunk is a useful tool.&#0160; I just wasn’t able to do what I wanted given the information that Vault is printing to the logs.&#0160; Also, I spent a lot of time on it, so I should get a blog post out of it at least.</p>
<p>Here is the app.&#0160; I was hoping for something that shows the download history of a file.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2014/VaultSplunk/HistoryWindow.png" /></p>
<p>It would be pretty cool if it worked, but there are too many cases where downloads will not show up in the list.&#0160; If your users download one file at a time, this will work great.&#0160; But if they download multiple files at once (and they do), then this app completely falls apart.&#0160; In my early tests, I only download one file at a time.&#0160; Oops.</p>
<p>The underlying problem is that the Vault log files are structured around “operations” and not around the “objects” being acted on.&#0160;&#0160; Vault likes to operate on multiple objects at once for performance reasons.&#0160; There is no clean way to log all the objects in one log entry, so that information just doesn’t get logged. </p>

<p><strong>Splunk Setup:</strong></p>
<p>OK, there are a lot of steps here.&#0160; But the added benefit is that you get Splunk up and running which provides a lot of ways for you to manage your Vault data.&#0160;</p>
<ol>
<li>Install Splunk.&#0160; I don’t recommend installing it on the Vault Server.</li>
<li>On the Vault Server, open up the IIS manager.</li>
<li>Go to the logging settings and make sure that “URI Query” is selected. <br /><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2014/VaultSplunk/iisSettings.png" /></li>
<li>Restart IIS if needed.</li>
<li>Sanity Check:&#0160; Perform some operations from the Vault Explorer client.&#0160; The new rows should show query strings describing the server calls.&#0160; Example:&#0160;
<p>2014-07-25 18:28:28 10.143.48.29 POST /AutodeskDM/Services/v19/PropertyService.svc <strong>op=GetProperties&amp;uid=2&amp;vaultName=Vault&amp;sessID=143994478&amp;app=VP</strong> 80 - 10.143.48.22 Mozilla/4.0+(compatible;+MSIE+6.0;+MS+Web+Services+Client+Protocol+4.0.30319.18408) 200 0 0 9 </p>
</li>
<li>Open up Splunk.</li>
<li>Click on the “Add Data” button on the main dashboard.</li>
<li>Choose “IIS logs” as the data type and follow the instructions.&#0160; Multiple steps are involved in moving log data across servers, so I’ll leave it to Splunk to explain that part.</li>
<li>Sanity Check:&#0160; From the Splunk homepage, click on the “Search and Reporting” button.&#0160; Click on data summary and select your Vault server host.&#0160; You should be able to see the contents of the IIS logs.</li>
<li>In Splunk, to to Settings-&gt;Fields.</li>
<li>Select “Add New” for Field Extractions.&#0160; To create a new field for reading the Vault Operation from the query string.<ol>
<li>Destination App: search</li>
<li>Name:&#0160; EXTRACT-OPERATION (or whatever you want)</li>
<li>Apply To: sourcetype</li>
<li>Name:&#0160; IIS Logs (may be different for your Splunk config)</li>
<li>Type: inline</li>
<li>Extraction/Transform:&#0160; <strong>op=(?P&lt;OPERATION&gt;.+?)[&amp;\s] <br /><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2014/VaultSplunk/extractField.png" /></strong></li>
</ol></li>
<li>Add another field extraction.&#0160; This time you are extracting the File ID.&#0160; Set Extraction/Transform to <strong>fileIterationId=(?P&lt;FILE_ID&gt;.+?)[&amp;\s]</strong></li>
<li>Add another field extraction.&#0160; This time you are extracting the User ID.&#0160; Set Extraction/Transform to <strong>uid=(?P&lt;USERID&gt;.+?)[&amp;\s]</strong></li>
<li>Sanity Check:&#0160; Open up the Vault client and download some files that are not already in you working folder.&#0160; When the entries show up in Splunk, expand the entry.&#0160; You should see that OPERATION, FILE_ID and USERID, as rows. <br /><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2014/VaultSplunk/extractResults.png" /></li>
<li>If you are using the free version of Splunk, you will need to configure the REST API to allow anonymous login.&#0160; <br />Go to <strong>$SPLUNK_HOME/etc/system/local/server.conf</strong> and add the following line in the [General] section:&#0160; <strong>allowRemoteLogin = always</strong></li>
<li>If you are using the enterprise version of Splunk, you should create a basic user just for reading this data.&#0160; SplunkVault does not encrypt the Splunk username/password information.</li>
<li>Download the SplunkVault app from the download link above.</li>
<li>Extract the zip in the folder C:\ProgramData\Autodesk\Vault 2015\Extensions.&#0160; You now have a SplunkVault folder under Extensions.&#0160; I didn’t build an installer for this one.</li>
<li>Restart Vault Explorer and login as an administrator.</li>
<li>Go to Tools-&gt;Splunk Vault Settings and fill out the fields.<ol>
<li>Splunk Port is the port of the API, which is different from the web page port.&#0160; 8089 is the default API port.</li>
<li>If you are using the free version, the user should be ‘admin’ and the password can be any value.</li>
<li>If you are using the enterprise version, the user and password should be the low-access user you set up in an earlier step. <br /><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2014/VaultSplunk/settings.png" /></li>
</ol></li>
<li>Save the settings.</li>
<li>Download some files that are not in your local folder.</li>
<li>Right click on a file, and select Download Activity.&#0160; You should see an entry for the recent download.&#0160; If not, wait a few minutes and try again.</li>
<li>You are done at this point.</li>

Anyway good try, Doug!

Are you going to try more?

As for me the most obvious way is to add advanced logging functionality in next releases (as SP or SR, for example) within ADMS - not outside of it. I think you have the ability to convey this idea to your PMs.

As both we know, outside logging is quite simple and works correct just with Vault Explorer, not with third-party solutions.

Regards, Dmitry

I agree.  The ideal solution is for Vault to have better logging capabilities.  I don't think there is much more that can be done through an app.

Is there any other way for Vault administrators/users to speed-up adding of this feature to next release, instead of kudoing "Activity Logs" at Idea Station (<a href="http://goo.gl/QgnOaZ)">http://goo.gl/QgnOaZ)</a> ?

There is really no way of things up.  I've heard that logging is on the agenda of things to be worked on, but I have no concrete details.

<p>Just because it’s in the Vault API, doesn’t mean you will be able to build anything cool with it.&#0160; There is plenty of stuff in there that is so specific to Vault Explorer or so difficult to use that it’s basically useless to you as an outside developer.&#0160; I’m feeling that this will probably be an entire series of articles... especially when I get to the Package Service.</p>
<p>So why am I bothering to write an article about something you can’t use?&#0160; Because it’s good to know what you can’t do upfront.&#0160; That way you don’t waste precious time on the impossible.&#0160; GI Joe cartoons taught me that “Knowing is half the battle.”&#0160; Well, following that logic, <strong><em>not-knowing</em></strong> is the other half.&#0160; So let’s get started!!</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #d09219;" />
<p>Vault Professional has a cool feature where you can put a <a href="http://underthehood-autodesk.typepad.com/blog/2006/03/watermarking.html" target="_blank">watermark</a> on your DWF files.&#0160; As a developer, you may be thinking that you can make use of this.&#0160; Maybe you want to download these watermarked files or view them in you own app.</p>
<p>No.&#0160; Sorry.&#0160; You can’t do that.</p>
<p>Although the Vault Server keeps track of the watermark settings, it only includes things like color, text, and location.&#0160; The server doesn’t actually generate a file with the watermark on it.&#0160; The watermark is <em>rendered</em> client-side.&#0160; It’s basically another layer drawn on top of the existing content in the DWF viewer.&#0160;</p>
<p>Vault Explorer uses a special DWF viewer that is compiled just for Vault.&#0160; And it doesn’t have an API.&#0160; Basically, the watermark functions in the Vault API are specifically for the out-of-the-box Vault clients and no one else.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #d09219;" />
<p><strong>Useless functions:</strong></p>
<p>All of these functions are in the Item Service.</p>
<ul>
<li>GetAllWatermarks</li>
<li>GetEnableWatermarking</li>
<li>SetEnableWatermarking</li>
<li>UpdateWatermarkDefinitions</li>
</ul>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #d09219;" />
<p><strong>Difficulty:</strong></p>
<p>If you really want to watermark your own DWFs, here are the basic steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Find a DWF viewer with an API.&#0160; Offhand, I don’t know if any exist.</li>
<li>Grab the DWF for a given Item.</li>
<li>Grab all watermarks from Vault.</li>
<li>Figure out which watermarks apply to the DWF.</li>
<li>Render the watermarks on the DWF view.</li>
</ul>

<p><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/Vault4.png" /><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/Commentary4.png" /></p>
<p>Earlier this week I listened in on a webinar on <a href="https://www1.gotomeeting.com/register/921695928" target="_blank">Vault Data Standard</a> and it got me to thinking.&#0160; Coming from a Vault API background, I have a different view of Data Standard then what is usually presented.&#0160; So I’d like to provide my thoughts since this <em>is</em> a blog and all....</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #666666;" />
<p><strong>APIs on top of APIs</strong></p>
<p>Data Standard provides a lot of features you can get through the API.&#0160; You can create custom commands, custom UI and make calls to the Vault server.&#0160; What’s interesting is that Data Standard itself is a Vault Explorer plug-in.&#0160; So the Data Standard API is basically an API on top of the Vault API.</p>
<p>It’s basically like the movie Inception, but with APIs instead of dreams.</p>
<p>Many pieces of the Data Standard just pass through to the Vault API.&#0160; Adding custom commands is an example of this.&#0160; The settings in the DS .mnu files are exactly the same as the properties on CommandItem from the Vault API.&#0160; In this aspect, knowledge of the Vault API transfers directly over to Data Standard.</p>
<p>Another example is the $vault object that shows up in the .ps1 files.&#0160; The purpose of the object is for making web service calls to the Vault server.&#0160; $vault is a WebServiceManager object being passed in directly from the Vault SDK DLLs.&#0160; If you want to do anything with $vault, you need the Vault API documentation on-hand.&#0160; Again, if you are already familiar with the Vault API, than this is no problem.</p>
<p>What I’m more curious about is the people <em>without</em> a Vault API background.&#0160; How well are they able to utilize Data Standard?&#0160; Does DS ease them into the world of Vault programming, or does the Vault API hit them like an impassable brick wall?</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #666666;" />
<p><strong>Beyond the API</strong></p>
<p>The stuff that interests me most is the stuff that can’t be done through the Vault API.&#0160;</p>
<p>First and foremost, the CAD plug-ins are awesome.&#0160; Data Standard is not just a plug-in to Vault; it plugs into AutoCAD and Inventor as well.&#0160; That way you can easily create an Inventor dialog that is Vault-aware, for example.&#0160; Going through the traditional APIs would be a daunting task.&#0160; You would need to be an expert in both APIs and would have to figure out how to hook the two together.&#0160; DS solves all that stuff for you in a way that makes it look easy.</p>
<p>Another aspect of DS are the template features.&#0160; New CAD files can be copied from a template instead of staring from a blank file.&#0160; DS uses Vault functionality to centralize the storage of the templates.&#0160; This is less of an example of a generic API and more of an example of a focused solution.&#0160; Data Standard is really a dual product: It’s an API, and it’s an end-user utility.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>The two aspects are not at odds with each other, but I’m not sure if they blend well together either.&#0160; It feels to me more like a Swiss Army knife.&#0160; It’s a bunch of seemingly unrelated stuff packaged together.&#0160; Maybe that’s why it’s a hard product to describe it to people.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #666666;" />
<p><strong>Migration</strong></p>
<p>One thing like like about compiled programming languages, such as C#, is that you get compile errors when something goes wrong.&#0160; That way if an API changes, you know right away what broke.&#0160; PowerShell, however, is a scripting language.&#0160; So it’s harder to find the breakages.&#0160; Usually, they show up at runtime and only if specific pieces of code are run.&#0160;</p>
<p>If you have a lot of PowerShell code in your Data Standard implementation, you may find it hard to maintain.&#0160; Everything will seem fine at first after an upgrade, but things start failing as people start using the custom functions.&#0160; Even if you think you have everything updated, a CAD user somewhere may hit lesser-used code that calls an obsolete Vault API function.&#0160;</p>
<p>Yes, Vault provides compatibility for older versions of the web service API, but in order to use them, you need to have the older SDK objects.&#0160; If Data Standard is passing in the 2015 version of the WebServiceManager, then you can’t make use of the 2014 server APIs.</p>
<p>There are lots of ways to solve, or minimize these issues when they do come up.&#0160; For now, Data Standard is new, so nobody has run into migration issues... yet.</p>

I was registered for the webcast but I'm living in other half of the Earth thus I missed it most likely because I was sleeping.
Where could I get the video now?

<p>In the past, I posted the <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2012/02/installer-project.html" target="_blank">installer project</a> I used to build Vault apps.&#0160; However, that project was for Visual Studio 2010.&#0160; In the 2012 version, Microsoft dropped the installer project type and replaced it with an Install Shield project type.&#0160; So I’ll share with you my latest installer template.&#0160; You do not need to purchase Install Shield.</p>
<p><a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/Apps/Installer/InstallerProject-VS2012.zip" target="_blank">Click here to download the project source</a></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #013181;" />
<p><strong>My recommendations on how to configure:</strong></p>
<p>In the solution explorer, you will see that Install Shield sets things up in numbered steps, so I’ll just go through the relevant parts, from the top on down.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2014/InstallerTemplate/SolutionExplorer.png" /></p>
<p>I usually just skip over the Getting Started and Project Assistant stuff.&#0160; Personally, I found it more confusing than helpful.</p>
<ol>
<li>Organize Your Setup<ol>
<li>General Information<ol>
<li>Replace all the TODO parts.&#0160; Such as ProductName, INSTALLDIR, Subject, Author and Publisher.</li>
<li>Generate new values for Product Code and Upgrade Code.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li>Specify Application Data<ol>
<li>Files<ol>
<li>Rename the TODO folder if there is one.</li>
<li>Put all your extension files in the <strong>[CommonAppDataFolder]\Autodesk\Vault 2015\Extensions\YourAppName</strong> folder.</li>
<li>You can ignore the Database folder.</li>
<li>You don’t need to put anything in the [AppDataFolder] and [CommonFilesFolder]</li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li>Configure the Target System<ol>
<li>You can ignore this stuff.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Customize the Setup Appearance<ol>
<li>Dialogs<ol>
<li>Check the dialogs that you want to show up during the install.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li>Define Setup Requirements and Actions<ol>
<li>You can ignore this stuff.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Prepare for Release<ol>
<li>The SingleImage is the output type you probably want.&#0160; Here are the settings I use.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>

<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #013181;" />
<p>Now you are ready to build.&#0160; If all goes well, you will see your setup.exe file in your output folder, which is something like <strong>[projectFolder]\Express\SingleImage\DiskImages\DISK1</strong></p>
<p>Now all you have to do is zip up the EXE, post it on your blog, and wait for the money to roll in.&#0160;</p>

<p>One of the biggest confusions about the Vault/SharePoint integrations is how filtering and paging works.&#0160; It confuses me from time to time, and I wrote the integration.&#0160; In this article, I’ll try to describe what’s going on behind-the-scenes to give you a better picture of the integration and how to configure it correctly.&#0160; Ahh, the joys of middleware.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #5acb04;" />
<p>Let’s start with a SharePoint list showing some Vault data.&#0160;</p>
<p><a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2014/SharepointFilter/list.png" target="_blank"><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2014/SharepointFilter/list_scaled.png" /></a><span style="color: #666666;">(click image for full view)</span></p>
<p>Take a minute to guess how that data got from Vault to SharePoint.&#0160; Whatever you came up with in your head is probably wrong.&#0160; I’m not saying you are dumb or anything; I’m saying that the workflow is counter-intuitive.</p>
<p>Basically there are three components in play here:&#0160; SharePoint, Vault and the integration between the two.&#0160;</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2014/SharepointFilter/integration.png" /></p>
<p>When the user goes to view the list, SharePoint invokes the Integration, the Integration invokes Vault.&#0160; The data is then pass up through the Integration back to SharePoint.&#0160; Pretty standard so far.</p>
<p>My example screenshot shows 10 items on the page.&#0160; So you would think that 10 objects flowed through the Integration.&#0160; But that’s not what happened.&#0160; The fact that SharePoint is showing 10 rows/page is a <strong>view setting</strong>, which include page size, column layout, sorting, etc.</p>
<p>Here is the important thing that you need to understand:</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" width="470">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="470"><strong>The integration does not know what the view settings are.</strong></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>For example, the Vault Integration does not know to ask Vault for 30 objects.&#0160; It also doesn&#39;t know, which columns to sort by, which page the user is viewing or any of the other things in the view model.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #5acb04;" />
<p>So, what does the Integration use as criteria when it pulls data from the Vault?&#0160; The answer is <strong>Data Source Filters</strong>.&#0160; These are the only things that SharePoint communicates to the Integration.&#0160; The filters themselves are defined by the integration and will be different depending on the Vault object being shown.&#0160; In this example, the Integration defined four filters.&#0160; The values are configurable, but you can&#39;t add or remove filters.</p>
<p><a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2014/SharepointFilter/settings.png" target="_blank"><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2014/SharepointFilter/settings_scaled.png" /></a> <br /><span style="color: #666666;">(click image for full view)</span></p>
<p>Basically, the integration only gets to see the part in red.&#0160; The rest of the list settings are the SharePoint’s view model.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at the <strong>Limit</strong> filter.&#0160; This one is important because that’s how many objects the integration asks for.&#0160; It has nothing to do with how much SharePoint shows on the screen.&#0160; If you leave this field blank, the Integration uses the <strong>default value of 100</strong>.&#0160; You can set the limit higher if you want, but that may slow things down.</p>
<p>The other filter values are pretty straightforward.&#0160; Set the State to “Released” and the integration will ask for only Released objects in the Vault.&#0160; Set the Vault Folder to “$/Projects” and only files under that folder will be returned from Vault.</p>
<p>When the Vault Objects are handed from the Integration over to SharePoint, the view settings are then applied.&#0160; This includes sorting and filtering.&#0160; If there are 100 Vault objects, but the view has only 10 items on a page, then the other 90 objects are discarded.&#0160;</p>
<p>In the end, you have two levels of filtering:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>First Level</strong> - Data that the Integration requests from Vault.&#0160; This is controlled by the Data Source Filters.</li>
<li><strong>Second Level</strong> - SharePoint view settings.&#0160; This is controlled by the other SharePoint settings.</li>
</ul>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #5acb04;" />
<p>Let’s walk through the whole process, just to drive the point home...</p>
<ol>
<li>A SharePoint user views a Vault list.</li>
<li>SharePoint invokes the Integration, passing in the Data Source Filters for that list view. <em>(ex. limit=100)</em></li>
<li>Integration queries objects in Vault, based on the Data Source Filter values.&#0160; <em>(ex. the Vault query is limited to 100 results)</em></li>
<li>Vault returns the object set.&#0160; <em>(ex. 100 objects)</em></li>
<li>Integration passes the object set back to SharePoint.&#0160; <em>(ex. 100 objects)</em></li>
<li>SharePoint constructs the view, discarding anything not in the view. <em>(ex. display first 10 rows sorted by name, discard other 90 objects)</em></li>
</ol><hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #5acb04;" />

Have you found a workaround for allowing users to directly download search results by clicking on the filename rather than navigating to 'View Profile'
then 'Click here to download'from within SharePoint? 

This has been our main feedback complaint and I realize it is a SharePoint constraint.  In standard SP document lists, users are able to click on and access files or download them; is there a way you know of to allow this rather than the View Item, View Profile choices that are given?

thanks,

Blake

I wasn't aware that this workflow was an issue.  The best way to request features and changes is to post your suggestion on the Vault Idea Station.  <a href="http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/Vault-IdeaStation/idb-p/2">http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/Vault-IdeaStation/idb-p/2</a>

Great work and right direction, Doug!

But can you clear some things:
<ol>
<li>Are you handling SOAP traffic in LOG files (for example, at 4:25)? And how did you do this if 'yes' - customizing IIS logs, etc.?</li>
<li>Or you just handling/parsing URL string?</li>
<li>Can I see what did not-Vault-Explorer application do on server?</li>
</ol>

1. No.  I'm not intercepting SOAP traffic.  I'm just reading from the log files.

2. I'm just reading from the URL string.  Several of the Vault clients add extra data to the query string, and that is what I am reading out in Splunk.

3. Query string data is not automatic.  The client has to explicitly add that data.  Vault Explorer and Inventor definitely add this data.  I am not sure about other Autodesk applications.

Third-party apps are probably not setting the query string.  But if it's a plug-in to Vault Explorer, I think the query string will be set.  I need to test.

That's not good enough.

This way user can work from third-party app and no operations won't be recorded.

As I know, IIS in 'debug' mode can show the SOAP traffic. But IIS can't log it in 'regular' mode - only via certain customizations with programming. If you could solve this puzzle - that would be the most appropriate solution for any cases.

Yes, I understand that this app will not cover all cases.  However, I think it will be useful for most of the Vault customers.

<p><strong>Important News</strong>:&#0160; Before I get into this article, there are some hotfixes you will want to get if you are going to use persist(ent/able) IDs.&#0160; If you are already using these IDs and have replicated Vault database servers, you need to check those IDs to make sure they are valid.</p>
<p>Hotfix links:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/vault-products/downloads/caas/downloads/content/cumulative-hotfix-2-for-autodesk-vault-2014-sp2.html" target="_self">Vault 2014 SP2</a></li>

</ul>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #5acb04;" />
<p>Once again, the API contains two different things that are almost spelled the same&#0160; (<a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2013/02/generating-file-names.html" target="_blank">Naming scheme and numbering scheme</a>, I’m looking at you).&#0160; This time around it’s Persist<strong>ent</strong> IDs and Persist<strong>able</strong> IDs.&#0160; These two things are almost the same, but API’s don’t understand “almost”.&#0160; If it’s not exactly the same, it’s invalid.&#0160; There is no in-between.</p>
<p>I’ve already written about <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2013/08/persistent-ids.html" target="_blank">persist<strong>ent</strong> IDs</a>, so you can give that a read if you want to know about the concept.&#0160; Persist<strong>able</strong> IDs are the same thing except those IDs have an extra character in from of them.&#0160; No, I’m not making that up.</p>
<p>An “m” is put on the front if the&#0160;Persist<strong>able</strong> ID is not version specific.&#0160; A “v” is put on the front if the ID to a specific version.&#0160; The “m” stands for Master, in case you are wondering.&#0160; Like how a FileMasterId is the same for all versions of a file.&#0160; Anyway, the rest of the ID is the same as the Persist<strong>ent</strong> ID.&#0160; So you can easily convert from one to the other by adding or removing the character at the front.</p>
<p>The other difference between the two ID types is where they are found at the API.&#0160; Persist<strong>ent</strong> IDs are at the web service layer, in the <strong>KnowledgeVaultService</strong>.&#0160; Persist<strong>able</strong> IDs are in the VDF layer, in Connection.<strong>PersistableIdManager</strong>.</p>
<p>Sure, it would be nice if we could consolidate these two types, but that would require one of them to change.&#0160; And the entire point of these IDs is that <em>they can’t ever change</em>.&#0160; So were stuck with these two.&#0160; If you use one to store data, just make sure you remember which type of ID you used.</p>

Important News:  Before I get into this article, there are some hotfixes you will want to get if you are going to use persist(ent/able) IDs.  If you are already using these IDs and have replicated Vault database servers, you need to check those IDs to make sure they are valid.

Once again, the API contains two different things that are almost spelled the same  (Naming scheme and numbering scheme, I’m looking at you).  This time around it’s Persistent IDs and Persistable IDs.  These two things are almost the same, but API’s don’t understand “almost”.  If it’s not exactly the same, it’s invalid.  There is no in-between.

<p>Usually I don’t post any information about my Vault apps until it’s completed.&#0160; But this time I want to try something different.&#0160; I’m going to post information on the app as it is being developed.&#0160; That way people can provide early feedback and suggestions.&#0160; If this format works out well I may use it for other projects in the future.</p>
<p>In this edition, I’ll just talk about the concept for the app.&#0160; I haven’t started coding yet.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #013181;" />
<p><strong>Coming Up with the App</strong></p>
<p>I get my app ideas from many places.&#0160; Sometimes it&#39;s from my own use of the product.&#0160; Sometimes people make suggestions to me.&#0160; Sometimes I just want to show off a cool API feature.&#0160; Usually it comes from hearing about people’s usage of the product.&#0160;</p>
<p>For example, AU.&#0160; It’s hard to go to that event and <em>not</em> come away with a bunch of ideas on what can be improved.&#0160; In addition to in-person events, there are plenty of online sources to go for ideas.&#0160; There are discussion groups, beta forums, and the <a href="http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/Vault-IdeaStation/idb-p/2" target="_blank">Idea Exchange</a>.&#0160;</p>
<p>This time around, I’m going to write an app to help manage the various log files that Vault spits out.&#0160; Like most of my apps, this one has been in my head for a while.&#0160; It’s a theme that keeps coming up when talking to customers, and I don’t think there are any Vault-specific solutions out there yet.&#0160; In fact, the problem got worse in Vault 2014 with the AVFS, which has it’s own separate log file.&#0160; This kind of thing that is perfect grounds for a custom app.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #013181;" />
<p><strong>My Vision For App</strong></p>
<p>I’m not big into problem statements, at least not when it comes to apps.&#0160; I usuall just have an idea in my head of how it should work, and I try to make that vision a reality.&#0160; Here is my vision for this app...</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Consolidation</strong> - Bring all the Vault logs together in one place.&#0160; The 3 main ones I will be focusing on are the ADMS logs, the AVFS logs and the IIS logs.&#0160; The ADMS Console lets you view some of these logs, but it’s just a text reader.&#0160; And you have to read them one at a time.&#0160; I’m thinking of something more like a single database table that can store and retrieve years’ worth of Vault logs in one place.</li>
<li><strong>Deeper Information</strong> - If you mine the log files right, you can find out things like how user 863 downloaded file 16734 yesterday afternoon.&#0160; That’s probably not much use to you unless you are the Rain Man.&#0160; To decode those numbers, you need an app that uses the Vault API.&#0160; So my app will be able to show that user Bob looked at file ProjectX.dwg.</li>
<li><strong>Push Operations</strong> - A couple of people requested a way to get alerts.&#0160; So this app may be able to help out with that.&#0160; It could possible do things like, send out weekly reports, or send out immediate alerts when critical errors pop up.</li>
</ul>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #013181;" />
<p><strong>App Framework</strong></p>
<p>“Don’t re-invent the wheel,” is something engineers like to say.&#0160; Personally, I think it’s fun to re-invent the wheel.&#0160; But in this case, I’m going to follow the popular advice.&#0160; <a href="http://www.splunk.com/" target="_blank">Splunk</a> is a tool that I’ve seen in action and have been very impressed with.&#0160; And Splunk has an API.&#0160;&#0160; So I’m sold at this point.&#0160; At least sold enough to investigate further.</p>
<p>That’s all the blogging I&#39;m goint to do for now.&#0160; In my next Developer Diary, I’ll be installing Splunk, hooking it to Vault and seeing what I can do with their API.&#0160; So keep a look out for that article.&#0160; It will be the most fun you can have without a catapult and a truckload of fruit pies.</p>

Hi, Doug

For many of us, excellent idea. It will be very helpful if ADMS console could give us more logging information for files, custom objects and change orders: check in, check out, deleting, renaming, moving, so on.), with time, user, and date.

Waiting for your next post...

Thanks!

Doug,

This does sound great. Is there a free version of Splunk? It appears as though it's quite expensive. How are you intending on using that? What's its purpose, could you use the same reporting engine Vault & Data Standard uses?

Cheers

Scott

Yes, Splunk has a free version <a href="http://www.splunk.com/view/free-vs-enterprise/SP-CAAAE8W">http://www.splunk.com/view/free-vs-enterprise/SP-CAAAE8W</a>

<p>Previously, I talked about how to <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2014/04/disabling-and-enabling-bom-rows.html" target="_blank">disable and re-enable a BOM row</a>, but that’s only half the story.&#0160; There are actually 2 types of “off” BOM rows.&#0160; The type I discussed earlier is an Item that has been disabled.&#0160; The other type is a <strong>Component BOM Row</strong>, which means that the child is not a real Item.&#0160; Components have the potential to be an Item, but are not quite there yet.&#0160;</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #d09219;" />
<p><strong>Reading the Unassigned Component rows</strong></p>
<p>When calling GetItemBOMByItemIdAndDate, make sure your the BOMViewEditOptions includes <strong>ReturnUnassignedComponents</strong>.&#0160; If not, then the Component rows will be omitted.&#0160; When you get back the ItemBOM, the BOMCompArray is where you can find the Component objects.&#0160; The BOM rows themselves are represented by objects the ItemAssocArray.&#0160; This array contains both Item-to-Item and Item-to-Component links.&#0160; So you need to account for both cases when reading ItemAssoc objects.</p>
<p>In the case of an Item-Component link, the BOMCompId will have a valid value but CldItemID and CldItemMasterID will be 0.&#0160; The parent will always be an Item, so ParItemID and ParItemMasterID will have a valid value in all cases.&#0160; There is no such thing as a Component-to-Component link in an Item BOM.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #d09219;" />
<p><strong>Turing on the component BOM row</strong></p>
<p>If you have a Component row that you want to enable, there are several steps.&#0160; You have to promote the Component into an Item.&#0160; Then you need to update the BOM association so that it points to the Item instead of the Component.</p>
<p>I’d better just post some sample code for this one.&#0160; Here is a function to enable a single component BOM row.</p>

<p><strong>Turing on the Component BOM row</strong></p>
<p>Technically it’s not a Component row any more.&#0160; It’s a normal row since the child is an Item.&#0160; If you want to turn off the row, you can <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2014/04/disabling-and-enabling-bom-rows.html" target="_blank">disable it</a>.&#0160; Disabling the row leaves the Item intact.&#0160; So the row is still an Item-to-Item link.</p>
<p>If we want to truly revert the state, so that it’s an Item-to-Component link, you can delete the Item.&#0160; This will cause the BOM to revert the row back to using the Component.&#0160; This process only works for Items that come from Components.&#0160; If the Item was created directly in the Item Master, then there is no Component.&#0160; Deleting an Item in this case will simply remove it from all BOMs that it’s in.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #d09219;" />
<p><strong>Where do Components come from</strong></p>
<p>Components come from CAD files.&#0160; When a CAD file is uploaded to Vault, the CAD plug-in includes BOM information.&#0160; That information becomes Components, and Components become Items.&#0160; If you want more information, you can read the article about the <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2012/11/the-bom-pipeline.html">BOM Pipeline</a>.&#0160; The basic takeaway is that Components are hooked to CAD files.&#0160; Items created directly in the Item Master have no Components.</p>

Previously, I talked about how to disable and re-enable a BOM row, but that’s only half the story.  There are actually 2 types of “off” BOM rows.  The type I discussed earlier is an Item that has been disabled.  The other type is a Component BOM Row, which means that the child is not a real Item.  Components have the potential to be an Item, but are not quite there yet.

<p>PLM 360 recently updated it’s <a href="http://www.autodeskplm360.com/pricing-model.html" target="_blank">pricing page</a>, so I’d like to point out a few things that are of interest to API developers.&#0160;</p>
<p><strong>API development is open to users with either a Professional or Enterprise license.</strong>&#0160; For in-house development, you can use your own Pro license for writing custom utilities.&#0160; For third party development, you can contact the Autodesk Development Network if you want a tenant and Pro license for development purposes.</p>
<p><strong>Sandbox environments are available.</strong>&#0160; This is very useful if you are writing an app or integration that modifies data.&#0160; Speaking from experience, you <em>don’t</em> want to debug on live data.&#0160; A sandbox environment is a clone of your live data.&#0160; So you can develop and debug your app without the worry of corrupting &quot;real&quot; data.&#0160; You are allowed one data refresh per month, so you still need to be careful.</p>
<p>Sandbox environments can either be on the regular production environment or on a “Preview” server.&#0160; Preview tenants run the beta code for the next release, so you can see changes before they go live.&#0160; This is useful if you have an integration that you need to keep healthy.&#0160; A Preview tenant can be used detect breakages before they happen.&#0160; At this time, I don’t have details on how much lead time you get with a Preview tenant.&#0160; I think it varies from release to release.</p>

<p>It’s probably worthwhile for me to compare and contract both products.&#0160; I should also mention that they are not mutually exclusive.&#0160; You can have both Data Standard and DECO installed side by side if you want.</p>
<p>Another cool thing is that both products use the same framework for editing UI.&#0160; They both use XAML files, which can be edited in the free version of Visual Studio.&#0160; So learning one product will give you experience on the other one.&#0160; Likewise, it should be very easy to port your DECO content to Data Standard.</p>

<p>DECO (Design Editor for Custom Objects) mainly specializes in “property page” functionality.&#0160; It’s great for displaying and editing properties on a single custom object.&#0160; If that’s is all the functionality you need, then you will probably find DECO a bit easier to use than Data Standard.</p>

<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #013181;" />
<p>Data Standard can be used to create New, Edit and View operations for custom objects.&#0160; However, Data Standard offers many more features.&#0160; You can create custom commands and tabs for whatever you want.&#0160; You are not limited to New, Edit and View.&#0160; You are also not limited to custom objects.&#0160; Files, folders, items and change orders are also customizable.</p>
<p>The extra features make Data Standard a bit more complex.&#0160; So it’s a few extra steps to get New, Edit and View working when compared to DECO.</p>

Doug, do you know why Data Standard for 2014 was removed from the subscription center? It appears that only 2015 is available now.

I'm not on the Vault team anymore, so I'm not updating any of my apps.  Hopefully, Data Standard can provide all the features you need.

Not on Vault anymore - that's terrible news, we will miss you greatly Doug. Has someone replaced you, who is going to keep us informed and hold our hands when we have Vault coding problems?

Thanks.  I miss Vault too.  I'm still at Autodesk, so you'll probably see me around next time I have a product that I can blog about.

Autodesk Developer Network fully supports Vault.  There is also a discussion group on Vault programming that's run by the Vault development team.  <a href="http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/vault-customization/bd-p/301">http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/vault-customization/bd-p/301</a>

So that part is covered.  The main thing missing is somebody to take over blogging and sample apps.  But I still prod the Vault team whenever I get a chance.

<p>Project Thunderdome is here for Vault 2015.&#0160; It’s the same product you have come to know and love, but I’ve made a few improvements this time around.&#0160;</p>
<p>First, it’s been posted to the <a href="http://apps.exchange.autodesk.com/VLTC/en/Detail/Index?id=appstore.exchange.autodesk.com%3avault2015projectthunderdome_windows32and64%3aen" target="_blank">Vault App Store</a>.&#0160; So that’s a bit of a status upgrade from previous years.&#0160; If you are interested in the <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/Apps/Thunderdome/ProjectThunderdome-5.0.2.0-src.zip" target="_blank">source code</a>, you can still get that from this blog.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Next, I added support for <a href="http://help.autodesk.com/view/VAULT/2015/ENU/?guid=GUID-5030830E-69F8-4A57-ABE4-D1D430C58F95" target="_blank">Vault Data Standard</a>.&#0160; Several people asked for this feature, and I was more than happy to put it in.&#0160; Data Standard provides some great customization options, and Thunderdome gives you an easy way to distribute those customizations to your other Vault users.</p>
<p>If you want more information on what Project Thunderdome is, the app store page has a description of the app.&#0160; I also have <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2012/08/project-thunderdome-2013.html" target="_blank">a video</a> from a couple years ago that goes over the basics of how to use it.</p>
<p>Enjoy.</p>

Hello Doug...
Is possible to have multiple deployments? Our manufacturing engineers have a different grid state than our design engineers. Our purchasing even has a different grid state.
Thanks for the awesome tool!

Thunderdome supports only one deployment package.  It's a great idea though.  You should suggest it <a href="http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/vault-ideastation/idb-p/2">http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/vault-ideastation/idb-p/2</a>

According to the store page, Project Thunderdome 2016 works with Vault Workgroup and Professional.
<a href="https://apps.exchange.autodesk.com/VLTC/en/Detail/Index?id=appstore.exchange.autodesk.com%3avault2015projectthunderdome1428957288_windows32and64%3aen">https://apps.exchange.autodesk.com/VLTC/en/Detail/Index?id=appstore.exchange.autodesk.com%3avault2015projectthunderdome1428957288_windows32and64%3aen</a>

Vault Basic doesn't support plug-ins to the Vault Explorer client, which is why you need Workgroup or higher.

<p>When it comes to ordering a Bill of Materials there are a surprising number of options.&#0160; Three to be specific.&#0160; This might seem overkill to some people, but BOM ordering is a pretty important topic.&#0160; So there are couple of different mechanisms used to fit the various requirements.&#0160; Hopefully, you will find one that is right for you (because the engineering team doesn’t want to write a fourth).</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #5acb04;" />
<p><strong>Detail ID</strong></p>
<p>Let’s start with the most inflexible.&#0160; Strictly speaking, this is for cases where there is an assembly sheet with bubbles calling out each part detail.&#0160; The parts list on the sheet is basically an ordered list of the called-out components.&#0160; Vault preserves this data in the BOM as the Detail ID.</p>
<p>One interesting aspect of these Details IDs is that they are specific to an occurrence within a BOM.&#0160; This means that a given part may have different Detail IDs in different BOMs even if the parent/child relationship is the same.&#0160;</p>
<p>Another aspect of detail ID is that it’s strongly tied to the CAD file.&#0160; Items created in the Item Master will not have these values.&#0160; Detail IDs can only be created or edited through the <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2012/11/the-bom-pipeline.html" target="_blank">BOM pipeline</a>.&#0160; So if a value needs to be updated, it requires checking out the file, modifying the CAD data, checking the file back in, and updating the item.</p>
<p>The fact that it’s difficult to edit is actually a good thing.&#0160; The entire point of the Detail ID is that it’s tied to the CAD data.&#0160; If you want something more flexible I suggest using...</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #5acb04;" />
<p><strong>Position Number</strong></p>
<p>Much like Detail ID this is a string value that identifies a BOM row.&#0160; The main difference here is that position number can be easily edited in Vault.&#0160; It’s not tied to CAD data, so it can be set on Items not created from a file.&#0160; Lastly, it is not occurrence based, which means the position number is the same for each parent/child relationship regardless of which BOM it shows up in.</p>
<p>The default Position Number is a copy of the Detail ID, if it exists.&#0160; Although you can edit the value in Vault, chose changes may get overwritten the next time the item gets updated from CAD.&#0160; Ideally Position Number should be used when you want Detail ID behavior on an item with no Detail ID.</p>
<p>NOTE:&#0160; Even though the word <em>number</em> is clearly in the title, the data type is a String.&#0160; This happens a lot with Vault Items for some reason, like with Item Number.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #5acb04;" />
<p><strong>Row Order</strong></p>
<p>Row Order behaves a lot like Position Number but with two main differences:&#0160; Row Order is an integer, and Row Order does not get overwritten during an update from CAD file operation.&#0160; This value is fully controlled in Vault, with minimal connection to CAD data.&#0160; It’s great to use when you want your Row Order to have no other meanings.&#0160; It doesn’t represent callouts in a drawing, or an ID in an external system.&#0160; It’s just the order you want your BOM to be in.</p>
<p>Row Order is the only one of the three that is guraranteed to have a value.&#0160; So it&#39;s a good default mechanism to use if you don&#39;t know which one to pick.&#0160; But beware,<em> the values are not guaranteed to be unique</em> (the same is true for the other two systems).</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #5acb04;" />
<p><strong>Relevant ItemService APIs</strong></p>
<p>If you want to read the Detail ID, you need to read the occurrence data from a BOM.&#0160; When calling <strong>GetItemBOMByItemIdAndDate</strong> make sure to pass in <strong>ReturnOccurrences</strong> as one of the BOMViewEditOptions.&#0160; If you do, you should get back an array of <strong>ItemBOMOcc</strong> objects.&#0160; The <strong>Val</strong> property on this object is the Detail ID.</p>
<p>Both Position Number and Row Order can be read on the <strong>ItemAssoc</strong> objects in an ItemBOM.&#0160; Row Order is the <strong>BOMOrder</strong> property, and Position Number is the <strong>PositionNum</strong> property.&#0160; To update Postition Number or Row Order, use the <strong>UpdateItemBOMAssociations</strong> function.</p>

<p>There was a video posted recently about <a href="https://autodesk-2.wistia.com/medias/zzt0pl52qj" target="_blank">Vault Office</a>, so I thought I would have an article about API licensing for Vault Office.&#0160; And while I’m at it, I may as well go over all the licensing rules for Vault 2015.&#0160; It’s not my favorite topic either, but it has to be done.&#0160; I’ll try to go quickly.</p>
<p>In case you are not aware, Vault Office is a separate license type designed for non-CAD users.&#0160; The idea is simple:&#0160; The Office license is cheaper than a standard Vault license, but the functionality is limited.&#0160; There are specialized clients which consume Vault Office licenses instead of regular Vault Workgroup or Professional licenses.</p>
<p>Don’t confuse Vault Office with the <a href="http://autodesk-2.wistia.com/medias/7xuthpmuq6" target="_blank">Vault plug-in for Microsoft Office</a>.&#0160; They are different things.&#0160; Actually, there is an MS Office plug-in which consumes a normal Vault license and an MS Office plug-in which consumes a Vault Office license.&#0160; So I guess it is kind of confusing.</p>
<p>Regarding API development, <strong>you cannot develop your own apps against a Vault Office license</strong>.&#0160; Currently, none of the Vault Office clients support plug-ins.&#0160; If you write your own standalone client, it will log in using a standard Vault license.</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>Here is a run down of the different licensing rules by product:</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" width="470">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="117">&#0160;</td>
<td valign="top" width="117"><strong>Regular license</strong></td>

Development is allowed on Vault Office 2016 client, but you need to stay within the Vault Office feature set.  I'm trying to hunt down some "official" documentation on this topic.

Here is what I have been able to find out...

Yes, you can develop a plug-in to the Vault Office client.  However, you are supposed to limit the functionality to be in-line with the Vault Office features.  You can contact Younes Yammouri (younes.yammouri AT autodesk.com) if you have functionality questions.

If you are developing your own EXE that talks to the Vault Server, then your app will consume a Workgroup or Professional license.  You can't write a stand-alone app that uses the Vault Office license.

<p><strong>Update:</strong>&#0160; One of my readers was able to find a link to <a href="http://www.asp.net/downloads/essential" target="_blank">Visual Studio 2008 Express Web Edition</a>.&#0160; After that, install the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=16682" target="_blank">Reporting add-on</a>, and you should be good for RDLC editing.&#0160; Thanks Alex.</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>So, you want to make custom Vault reports.&#0160; Good for you.&#0160; All you need is a Vault and Visual Studio 2008 *<em>record scratch</em>*</p>
<p>Wait, you <em>do</em> have Visual Studio 2008, don’t you?&#0160; If not, then you can just download it from Microsoft.com *<em>record scratch</em>*</p>
<p>Oh, it’s not up there anymore.&#0160; Well, lets go over our options then.&#0160; Before my record gets scratched up too much, I’m going to rule out time travel and breaking into ancient history museums.&#0160; Here are some <em>helpful</em> ways to edit your RDLC file.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #d09219;" />
<p><strong>RDL Designer from fyiReporting</strong> <br /><a href="http://www.fyireporting.com/" title="http://www.fyireporting.com/">http://www.fyireporting.com/</a></p>
<p>This is a free editor from a set of RDL / RDLC tools from fyiReporting.&#0160; It’s almost as good as Visual Studio 2008 was.&#0160; Unlike VS 2008, the RDL Designer is still available for download, which makes it the best RDLC editor by default.</p>
<p>I’ve used this tool myself, and I like it a lot.&#0160; My only complaint is that there is no snap feature or ability to easily line up your UI controls.&#0160; So you end up with a bunch of text boxes that are off by a few pixels.&#0160; If you are obsessive compulsive, this will drive you nuts.</p>
<p>You can line things up by modifying directly editing the properties, which is also extra painful.&#0160; Because RDLC is built around printing, all the dimensions are in units like inch, centimeter and point.&#0160; You can&#39;t define things in pixels, like I am used to in UI design.</p>
<p>Aside from the alignment issues, everything else is done well.&#0160; For example, you can easily create tables by selecting the fields you want, and it will build the data for you.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #d09219;" />
<p><strong>An XML Editor</strong></p>
<p>RDLC files are just XML files.&#0160; So you can use any text or XML editor to make changes.&#0160; It’s obviously harder to do it this way because you are designing a UI in a non-UI environment.&#0160; But it’s a good option for people who like to challenge themselves for no reason at all.</p>
<p>I should also note that the fyi RDL Designer has an XML mode.&#0160; So you can easily switch between the UI view and the XML view.&#0160; Very useful.&#0160; If you happen to run into any of those fyi guys, tell them I said thanks.</p>

It's funny that I downloaded and installed the Visual Web Developer 2008 Express (and the Report Add-in) just the week before you posted about this - checking Microsoft's site today reveals that it too has been removed. :(

Thanks for posting the alternative. FWIW do you know if Vault 2015 still uses 2008 format RDL files or if it has moved to the RDLC (2010) format?

Actually, I just double-checked and you can still get the installer for it from this page: <a href="http://www.asp.net/downloads/essential">http://www.asp.net/downloads/essential</a> - and you can get the Reporting add-on here: <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=16682">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=16682</a>

Regardless, Autodesk should have already moved to the 2010 format...

Thanks for the links, I'll update my article. 

I think the reason Vault is still on the old format is that there are no free editors for the 2010 format.  As far as I know, Visual Studio Express stopped supporting RDLC after 2010.  Free editing is an important feature of Vault reports.

Regardless, moving to the new format is worth considering.  I suggest logging the feature request at the Vault Idea Station:  <a href="http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/Vault-IdeaStation/idb-p/2">http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/Vault-IdeaStation/idb-p/2</a>

Hello there,

quick question on my side: Can we customize the report to only show row with specific property?
For exemple, I would have liked to show only component in the release state or I would like to add a custom property to filter only a value like "Sheetmetal".
I've tried to play with RDL Designer but I could not succeed in this.

Thanks for your support.

I'm pretty sure there is a way to do it.  I think you have to set filters on the table or something like that.

<p>One very big feature in Vault 2015 is the ability to turn a BOM row “on” or “off”.&#0160; I’m going to quickly go over the workflow for disabling a BOM row through the API and how to view that disabled row.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2014/DisableBomRow/screenshot.png" /></p>
<p>The on/off status of a BOM row is handled by the “isIncluded” property on a BOM association.&#0160; So disabling a BOM row is just a matter of setting isIncluded to false.</p>
<p>Basic steps (all functions are in the ItemService):</p>
<ol>
<li>Call <strong>EditItems</strong> on the parent Item in the association.</li>
<li>Call <strong>GetItemBOMByItemIdAndDate</strong> to read the BOM.&#0160; Make sure to use the item ID from the editable item returned in part 1.</li>
<li>In the resulting ItemBOM object, locate the <strong>ItemAssoc</strong> object representing the row you want to disable.</li>
<li>Call <strong>UpdateItemBOMAssociations</strong> to update the <strong>isIncluded</strong> value.&#0160; Although the function takes arrays of data, you only need to pass in the associations you are updating.&#0160;</li>
<li>Call <strong>UpdateAndCommitItems</strong>, passing in the parent item only.&#0160; This will finalize the change.</li>

<p>By default, the GetItemBOMByItemIdAndDate will omit all of the OFF rows.&#0160; If you want to see the row you disabled, you need to include “<strong>ReturnExcluded</strong>” in the options parameter.&#0160; This parameter lets you OR together multiple options, like a bitfield.&#0160; So passing in both “Defaults” and “ReturnExcluded” with show all the ON and OFF item rows.</p>

One very big feature in Vault 2015 is the ability to turn a BOM row “on” or “off”.  I’m going to quickly go over the workflow for disabling a BOM row through the API and how to view that disabled row.

Is the "enabling/disabling BOM row" replace the CAD Bom struct? (Normal, Purchased, Phantom,...). Cause i've seen the BOMStruct class was removed in 2015.

<p>In Vault 2015, PromoteFiles has been removed from the ItemService.&#0160; Previously, the quickest way was to call PromoteFiles followed by UpdateAndCommitItems.&#0160; Of course, more complex cases would require more API calls and data checks.&#0160; Anyway, the simple workflow just got more complex in 2015.&#0160; That’s sometimes the price you pay for better functionality.</p>
<p>Before I dive into the new code, let me explain the reason for the change.&#0160; First, PromoteFiles was not very efficient.&#0160; It tried to do the entire BOM at once, which is bad for server performance and scalability.&#0160; Next, it favored a file-first workflow (the files need to get created before the items).&#0160; In Vault 2015, there is much better support for item-first workflows, which I’ll go over in other articles.</p>
<p>For now, let’s go back to the simple file-first case.&#0160; You have an Inventor assembly checked-in and you want to create the BOM in Vault.</p>

<p>Basically, PromoteFiles has been replaced by 4 function calls: AddFilesToPromote, GetPromoteComponentOrder, PromoteComponents, and GetPromoteComponentsResults.&#0160; The &quot;timestamp&quot; variable is the thread that ties together the four calls.&#0160; When you want to finalize the operation, call UpdateAndCommitItems just like before.</p>
<p>Yes, it seems like 4 function calls makes things worse than before.&#0160; It&#39;s definitely more work for a client, but it makes and improvement on the server side.&#0160; Less is done in a single call, which means that transactions are smaller and quicker.&#0160; That, in turn, means more concurrency and throughput.</p>

Hi Doug, 
first of all many thanks for this article.
I need some help to update a Vault Extension from 2013 to 2015. I made an extension that automatically update an item to the most recent file version during the checkout_Post event of Inventor. This extension uses the old-and-removed function "UpdateFromFile".
With the new Vault SDK i'm not able to obtain the same result; i don't want to made a new item revision every time due to my company restrictions.

I've tried the new "UpdateItemFileAssociation" passing the unique Id coming from the Inventor CheckIn event, but in Vault the result is that the item lose his file (the primary). If i manually do an Update from the Vault client all is ok again....but the intention of this extension is exactly to do an automatic item update.

I'm quite desperate....
Thanks anyway in advance

Dave

I should probably write a blog article with a sample of the Update workflow.
In the meantime try this:
Use the code from this article but replace the "AddFilesToPromote" call with a call to "UpdatePromoteComponents".  The rest of the sample should be the same.

Hi Doug,
Thanks so much for all your insights.
I have used your code to build an app for promoting all legacy files to Items. The problem is, this code works perfect on single part files (.ipt), but assemblies (.iam) with components throw an error code (1387) for restrictions. I used your code, to drill down in the exception, and found the following exception, (2037) Operation cannot be performed because the item is not in an editable state. Can you please help?

Is the error thrown on UpdateAndCommitItems?

If so, I suggest looking at the "status" array on the itemsAndFiles object.  If the status on an Item is 1 (unaffected), then the Item wasn't edited.  When calling UpdateAndCommitItems, only pass in the Items that were promoted or updated.

Never mind, I found the solution in one of your older blog posts. The issue was that GetPromoteComponentsResults() was returning more Items that I needed, and some of them were not in edit mode.

Hello Doug,
I use your code to create BOM for assembly and I need all BOM rows to be enabled. I call AddFilesToPromote(ids, ItemAssignAll.Yes, false) method. Created BOM seems OK but only one child row of the top assembly is enabled in created BOM. Why other rows are not enabled? The following BOM lines are created.
TopAssembly
  |_SubAssembly(turned on)
  |    |_PartOfSubAssembly(turned off)
  |_PartOfTopAssembly(turned off)
Can you please help me?

Have a look at this article:  <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2014/04/disabling-and-enabling-bom-rows.html">http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2014/04/disabling-and-enabling-bom-rows.html</a>

If that doesn't solve the problem have a look at this article:  <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2014/05/component-bom-rows.html">http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2014/05/component-bom-rows.html</a>

<p>Vault 2015 has just been released.&#0160; Here is a quick breakdown of what’s new and what’s changed in the API.&#0160; Overall, these changes are reactions to changes in the Vault product itself.&#0160; There’s nothing new here specific to API developers.</p>

<p><strong>Edited out of Turn enhancements</strong></p>
<p>Vault has changed how it handles changes to files that have not been checked out.&#0160; It used to show an “edited out of turn” icon.&#0160; In 2015, the status now matches the status of the last downloaded state of the file (before the local edits).&#0160; An extra piece of information is provided indicating the “dirty” status of the local file.&#0160; This data is available through the UI and API.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2014/WhatsNewVault2015/status.png" /></p>
<p>When acquiring a file in this “dirty” state, the download will not proceed unless a “force override” option is applied.&#0160; This override can be done through both UI and non-UI workflows in the API.</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p><strong>Item BOM updates</strong></p>
<p>There have been changes to the BOM workflows.&#0160; A lot of these changes are around being able to add items first and easily hook to files later on.&#0160; Previous releases favored file-first workflows. Another workflow change is the ability to promote only part of a BOM, instead of being an “all or nothing” operation. <br />There are also some new concepts, such as “on” and “off” BOM rows.</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p><strong>Vault 2012 clients are no longer compatible</strong></p>
<p>You will not be able to use any of your Vault 2012 clients with Vault 2015 server.&#0160; This includes CAD applications (like AutoCAD 2012 and Inventor 2012), Vault 2012 SharePoint integration, custom apps, etc.</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p><strong>Compatibility with 2013 and 2014 clients*</strong></p>
<p>Vault 2013 and 2104 clients are compatible with Vault 2015 server.</p>
<p>* Calls to the Item and Package service will result in a runtime error.&#0160; This is due to breaking changes to the Item BOM workflows.&#0160; If your app is using either of these services, you should update to the 2015 SDK.</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p><strong>.NET 4.5</strong></p>
<p>SDK DLLs are built against .NET 4.5.&#0160; Visual Studio 2012 is the recommended development environment.</p>

Doug, Will Visual Studio 2013 Premium be ok to use with the Vault 2015 API? (currently using VS2010 Express)

Hi,

I have to migrate a VS2010 solution that was for VaultPro 2011 to VaultPro 2015.

1. Must I use the VDF (for example to SignIn the Vault)?
2. Must I need to use Visual Studio 2012 ?

Thanks,

1. Technically, no.  You don't need to use the VDF.  But the upload/download workflows have changed.  Overall, uploading and downloading is much easier through the VDF.  

Either way, you will have code to update, I believe it's easier to move over to the VDF.

2. You will need a Visual Studio edition that supports .NET 4.5.  I'm not sure if VS 2010 does that.  Both VS 2012 and VS 2013 should work fine.

Doug, Does the Vault Pro API provide a way to do Manage Ownership operations?  i.e. assign selected objects to a workgroup for lease period?

<p>Personally, I don’t like using Object, especially in an API.&#0160; You don’t get type safety, it’s hard to know what classes are supported, and it’s easy for code to break in future releases.&#0160; Unfortunately, Object is the type for property values.&#0160; So I’ll be taking a look at Connection.PropertyManager.GetPropertyValue() and describing what you can expect for the return types.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #d09219;" />
<p>The API documentation for PropertyDataType lists what the .NET classes are for the various Vault property types.</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" width="470">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="235"><strong>PropertyDataType</strong></td>
<td valign="top" width="235"><strong>Object type</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="235">Bool</td>
<td valign="top" width="235">System.Boolean</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="235">DateTime</td>
<td valign="top" width="235">System.DateTime</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="235">Image</td>
<td valign="top" width="235">ThumbnailInfo</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="235">ImageInfo</td>
<td valign="top" width="235">ImageInfo</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="235">Numeric</td>
<td valign="top" width="235">System.Double</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="235">Object</td>
<td valign="top" width="235">System.Object</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="235">String</td>
<td valign="top" width="235">System.String</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Unfortunately this table is not 100% correct.&#0160; There are various cases and outright defects you need to know.</p>
<p>First, let me explain the difference between <strong>Image</strong> and <strong>ImageInfo</strong>.&#0160; ImageInfo is for things like the Category Glyph properties.&#0160; These are graphics provided client-side.&#0160; The Image type is for thumbnails stored server-side.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p><strong>Picklists</strong> are one of the special cases you have to worry about.&#0160; If the property requires picking from a list, the value is of type PropertyDefinition.EnumeratedValue, which has both a display value (String) and a “true” value (Object).&#0160; The true value will have a data type matching the table above.&#0160; You can use the HasListValues property on PropertyDefintion to tell if a property is a picklist or not.</p>
<p>The Object is mainly there for if you want to <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2014/01/adding-a-custom-column-to-a-vdf-grid.html" target="_blank">add your own client-side property definitions</a>.&#0160; <strong>EntityType</strong> is the only out-of-the-box property that uses Object.&#0160; In that case, the object type is EntityClass.</p>
<p>In running my own test, I found that the system properties <strong>FileSize</strong> and <strong>VersionNumber</strong> did not behave as expected.&#0160; These have int values, not Doubles.&#0160; If you try a direct cast to Double, it will fail.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #d09219;" />
<p>So here is my summary of special cases...</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" width="470">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="235"><strong>Property System Name</strong></td>
<td valign="top" width="235"><strong>Object type</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="235">EntityType</td>
<td valign="top" width="235">EntityClass</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="235">FileSize</td>
<td valign="top" width="235">int</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="235">VersionNumber</td>
<td valign="top" width="235">int</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="235">&lt;any property with a value list&gt;</td>
<td valign="top" width="235">PropertyDefinition.EnumeratedValue</td>
</tr>

<p><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/PLM4.png" /> <br /><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/SampleApp4.png" /></p>
<p>Here is the first major update to The TTP Project.&#0160; The initial release was focused on proving out a prototype SDK for the PLM 360 API.&#0160; This time around I focused on making the app itself more useful.&#0160; There are some nice new features here, including things you can’t do through the web UI.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #013181;" />
<p><strong>Custom UI</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2014/TTP-update1/screenshot.png" target="_blank"><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2014/TTP-update1/screenshot_scaled.png" /></a> <br /><span style="color: #666666; font-size: xx-small;">(click for full size image)</span></p>
<p>You can now build your own UI for item detail fields.&#0160; This is done using XAML files to define the UI.&#0160; Next, you link those files to the workspaces and operations you want to apply them too.&#0160; If you are familiar with Vault Data Standard or <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2012/07/deco-custom-ui-without-custom-code.html" target="_blank">DECO</a>, then you get the idea.&#0160; In fact, most of the code is copied from DECO.</p>
<p>Custom UI is specific to a workspace.&#0160; You can also define different UI for each operation (view, new and edit).&#0160; The Layout Settings window that allows you to configure which UI is used in which cases.&#0160; If no UI is defined, then the default view is used.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2014/TTP-update1/layoutSettings_scaled.png" /></p>
<p><span style="color: #666666; font-size: xx-small;">(And yes, I notice that I forgot to change the dialog title)</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #013181;" />
<p><strong>Multi-select and multi-edit</strong></p>
<p>You can now select multiple items in a workspace.&#0160; The view panel will show all the fields that have the same value across all the selections.&#0160; If a field is different, it shows a blank value.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2014/TTP-update1/multiSelect.png" /></p>
<p>If you run the edit command during a multi-select, any field you set will be applied to all the selected items.&#0160; All other field values are left alone.&#0160; So it’s a nice easy way to set a value across multiple items.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #013181;" />
<p><strong>Other goodies</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Support for picklists.</li>
<li>Auto-renewal for expired security credentials.&#0160; If you liked my earlier <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2014/02/user-less-login-to-plm-360.html" target="_blank">OAuth article</a>, you can grab the TTP source code for examples.</li>
<li>Quicker navigation of items.&#0160; Caching has been implemented in the code so viewing an item for the second time doesn’t involve a web call.</li>
</ul>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #013181;" />
<p><strong>Requirements:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>PLM 360</li>
<li>Windows OS</li>
<li>.NET 4.5</li>
<li>For creating custom UI: A XAML editor such as Visual Studio or Expression Blend</li>

<p>A nice new feature in the latest PLM 360 update is that REST API will show more detailed error information for when a add/update operation fails because of bad field data.&#0160; For example, if you try to update an item with a value of “x” for a numeric field, you will now get an error specifying which field(s) failed and why.</p>
<p>First, let’s go over the generic error case.&#0160; For example, if you try to add a new item to a workgroup you don’t have write access to, here is the JSON error data you will get back.&#0160; The structure corresponds to the <a href="http://help.autodesk.com/view/PLM/ENU/?guid=GUID-5DE1B88C-89A9-418F-A0F4-D159FB87D2A7" target="_blank">APIError</a> class in the API documentation.</p>

<p><br />Now let’s look at the case where you try setting a field to a value that is not allowed.&#0160; Here is the JSON that you get back, which corresponds to the <a href="http://help.autodesk.com/view/PLM/ENU/?guid=GUID-431E3F3D-1C87-4FA6-AA2A-BB744A86E599" target="_blank">FieldValidation</a> error class.</p>

<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #5acb04;" />
<p>The first thing to note is that the FieldValidation data is a superset of the APIError data.&#0160; Another way to putting it is that FieldValidation is a subclass of APIError.&#0160; That means that PLM errors follow a similar pattern to Java and .NET Exceptions.&#0160; In those languages, Exception is the base class and specialized subclasses exist for specialized cases (IOException, StackOverflowException, and so on).&#0160; You as a programmer can handle things in multiple ways depending on how specialized the error is.&#0160; In PLM, APIError is the generic case and FieldValidationError is a specialized case.&#0160; More specialized errors may be added in the future, but for now, there is just one case.</p>
<p>Another thing to note is that the errorClass property matches the name of the error class.&#0160; This is to help your code deserialize to the correct object.&#0160; It’s a bit of a circular problem because you need to deserialize the JSON in order to figure out how the JSON should best be deserialized.&#0160;</p>
<p>I recommend a multi-phase approach to handing errors.</p>
<ol>
<li>In the event of an error (HTTP codes in the 400s or 500s), read the HTTP body into a string.</li>
<li>Deserialize the string into an APIError object.</li>
<li>Check the “errorClass” value.</li>
<li>If errorClass is not APIError, deserialize again to the proper error class.</li>
</ol>
<p>After that it&#39;s up to you how you want to use that error data.&#0160; But you definately have more options than you did before.</p>

<p>A while back, I showed you how to write a <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2014/01/adding-a-custom-column-to-a-vdf-grid.html" target="_blank">custom column</a> for your VDF grid.&#0160; But what about a custom row?&#0160; Can it be done?&#0160; If the answer was No, this would be a pretty short blog article, so the answer is Yes!</p>
<p>Just like with custom columns, this data is client-side only.&#0160; It’s not saved to the server or shared with other Vault clients.</p>
<p>Let’s just dive right in to code again.&#0160; For this example, I’ll put a custom row in the grid followed by a standard File row.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2014/CustomRow/GridOutput.png" /></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #d09219;" />
<p>If you already know how to populate the VDF grid with Entity objects, you are more than halfway there.&#0160; The only new steps are creating the EntityClass and Entity class.&#0160; Those are two different things, by the way.&#0160;</p>
<p><strong>EntityClass</strong> is the type of entity.&#0160; For example, File, Folder, Item, Change Order or Custom Object.&#0160; For this example, let’s create our own EntityClass.&#0160; You can easily do this by calling AddInternalEntityClass.&#0160; You pass in a unique ID and display name, and you will get back an EntityClass of you very own.&#0160; Although this is a custom entity class, it’s not a Custom Object.&#0160; Custom Objects are stored on the server.</p>

<p>Now let’s create our <strong>Entity class</strong>, which we do by deriving from IEntity. I’m just going to create something simple for demonstration purposes.</p>

A while back, I showed you how to write a custom column for your VDF grid.  But what about a custom row?  Can it be done?  If the answer was No, this would be a pretty short blog article, so the answer is Yes!

It's a crying shame that the results of all this awesome VDF goodness can't be passed to any of the existing Vault commands such as Send File. 

Even when you put a VDF control into a Vault tab, all of the normal Vault commands are greyed out. From a UX standpoint that is quite strange, since the rest of the default tabs don't behave that way from the user's perspective.

We don't think there is, but are you aware of a work around? one which doesn't involve re-writing/creating the native Vault commands in our own code. (Not all of the calls made by the Send File command are supported in the API).

No, there is no way to hook your VDF grid to existing Vault Explorer commands.

It's a good idea, and you should post it in the Vault Idea Exchange.  <a href="http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/Vault-IdeaStation/idb-p/2">http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/Vault-IdeaStation/idb-p/2</a>

<p>PLM 360 was updated last weekend.&#0160; The <a href="http://help.autodesk.com/view/PLM/ENU/?guid=GUID-7EF1798F-A80C-47D2-A237-E19501EB9F41" target="_blank">Read Me First page</a> has a listing of new REST API pages, but I’d like to also point some things out.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>New Feature - Better error information when adding or updating an item</strong>.&#0160; Now if the operation fails because of bad field data, you will get back information on which field(s) caused the failure.&#0160; It’s a big time saver when, for example, you are updating an item with 100 fields on it.&#0160; See <a href="http://help.autodesk.com/cloudhelp/ENU/PLM-360-REST-APIv2/files/GUID-431E3F3D-1C87-4FA6-AA2A-BB744A86E599.htm" target="_blank">FieldValidationError</a> for more information.</li>
<li><strong>New Feature - Item and System change logs.</strong>&#0160; You can now read the change logs through the API.&#0160; The <a href="http://help.autodesk.com/view/PLM/ENU/?guid=GUID-896FA1C1-B5BD-4EC1-BD36-C78BD8E14AF8" target="_blank">Item change log</a> shows you all recent item changes.&#0160; The <a href="http://help.autodesk.com/view/PLM/ENU/?guid=GUID-114F9C9B-0761-408D-BADB-009D2D92153B" target="_blank">System Configuration change log</a> shows changes to workspaces and other system level objects.&#0160; Both APIs require admin-level access.</li>
<li><strong>Enhancement - Max page size increased to 5000 when getting items</strong>.&#0160; Only applies to the <a href="http://help.autodesk.com/view/PLM/ENU/?guid=GUID-14018953-E39F-4CA5-B069-974618231608" target="_blank">get Items</a> endpoint.&#0160; 100 is still the max page size for other endpoints.</li>
<li><strong>Bugfix - filtered picklist values</strong> - When getting or setting filtered picklist values, the <a href="http://help.autodesk.com/view/PLM/ENU/?guid=GUID-0C8722DF-C209-4875-BA9C-A991E2985E19" target="_blank">PicklistValue</a> object should have a displayName field but not an id or url field.&#0160; This is because a filtered picklist is just a filter value, not a pointer to a specific item.&#0160; However, Item Detail is an exception.&#0160; In those cases, PicklistValue should have all 3 values set.</li>
<li><strong>API Change - Integer to Long</strong> - Most integer values have been changed to long.&#0160; For example, Item.Id.&#0160; If your app is currently using integers, you should be OK as long as you don’t have over 2 billion objects in your tenant.</li>

<p>Let’s say you have a service that synchronizes data to PLM 360 in the background.&#0160; It’s a headless system, so there is no UI.&#0160; The problem is that PLM uses 3-legged OAuth 1.0, and “human” is one of the 3 legs.&#0160; There are lots of blockers to prevent a non-human from authenticating.&#0160; For example, there is no API to pass in the username and password.</p>
<p>The solution is to log in once as a human and save off the OAuth access token.&#0160; From an OAuth point of view, the access token is just as good as being logged in to the system.&#0160; This means that a background service can use that access token instead of needing to store username/password data.</p>
<p>Access tokens from Autodesk have an active lifetime of 2 days, but they can be renewed up to 14 days after they have been issued.&#0160; When an access token is renewed, a new token issued and the old one is obsolete.&#0160; This process can be continued indefinitely.&#0160; The only time a human would have to get involved is if the 14 day period expires before a token can get renewed.&#0160; In these cases, a human would again need to log in manually and store off the access token.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #d09219;" />
<p>Let’s go over a specific example in PLM 360.&#0160; In step <a href="http://help.autodesk.com/view/PLM/ENU/?guid=GUID-752816A2-0100-4A56-A023-2108075CD012" target="_blank">5 of the authentication process</a>, the human user has already logged in and your app gets the access token.&#0160; If you want to do an auto-login in the future, you should store off some of the data coming back from the OAuth provider.&#0160;</p>

<p>Here is a summary of the stuff we care about:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>oauth_token</strong> - The Access Token public key.</li>
<li><strong>oauth_token_secret</strong> - The Access Token secret key.</li>
<li><strong>oauth_session_handle</strong> - The session handle.&#0160; Needed to renew or force expire an access token.</li>
<li><strong>oauth_expires_in</strong> - How long, in seconds, the access token will continue allowing access.</li>
<li><strong>oauth_authorization_expires_in</strong> - How long, in seconds, the access token will allow a renewal.</li>
</ul>
<p>You should store off the oauth_token, oauth_secret, oauth_session_handle, oauth_authorization_expires_in and oauth_expires_in.&#0160; You should also record the timestamp of when the token was issued.&#0160; The timestamp allows the application to calculate if a token is still active, needs renewing or is past the renewal point.</p>
<p>NOTE:&#0160; Make sure to store off the Access Token in a secure manner.&#0160; A compromised token is not as bad as a compromised username/password, but an attacker can still do a lot of damage with just the Access Token.</p>
<p>Now your app has a way to log in to PLM without user intervention.&#0160; It can just read in the saved OAuth data and continue to the <a href="http://help.autodesk.com/view/PLM/ENU/?guid=GUID-9D1F0E16-57E3-40B9-8987-EB617C4FCD76" target="_blank">next step</a> in the authentication process.&#0160; The part that involved a human has already passed, so things can be automated from here on out.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #d09219;" />
<p>When you want to renew your token, you will again call POST on https://accounts.autodesk.com/<strong>OAuth/AccessToken</strong>, but the input parameters are a bit different then when you first get the token. The oauth_token should be the current access token and the oauth_session_handle should be passed in too.&#0160; No verifier is needed.&#0160; The request should be signed by your Consumer Secret and Access Secret.</p>

<p>The response looks the same as when the token was first issued, but there are now new values for the Access Token, Access Secret and Session Handle. The old values are now invalid and cannot be used to access PLM 360.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #d09219;" />
<p>Lastly, there may be cases where you want to invalidate the access token <em>right now</em>.&#0160; You don’t want to wait 2 days for it to expire.&#0160; You can do this by making a POST call to</p>
<p>https://accounts.autodesk.com/<strong>OAuth/InvalidateToken</strong>. As usual, this must be a signed request (use your Consumer Secret and Access Secret), with a bunch of oauth parameters passed in. It also requires that you pass in the session handle from the last /OAuth/AccessToken call.</p>

EXCERPT:
Let’s say you have a service that synchronizes data to PLM 360 in the background.  It’s a headless system, so there is no UI.  The problem is that PLM uses 3-legged OAuth 1.0, and “human” is one of the 3 legs.  There are lots of blockers to prevent a non-human from authenticating.  For example, there is no API to pass in the username and password.

<p>I love computer games, and for years I’ve been looking for a way to make a game out of the product I was working on.&#0160; Vault didn’t really give me many options.&#0160; But writing a game in PLM 360... that’s just crazy enough to work.</p>
<p>So come with me to a land of adventure and treasure.&#0160; Of heroes and monsters.&#0160; Of wasting time writing games instead of doing more important work.&#0160; Come with me to THE DEADLY DUNGEONS OF DOOM !!!</p>

Doug, it's wonderful solution - to study CAD/PDM/PLM programming through games! I've done something like this <a href="http://zippybytes.blogspot.com/2013/11/lets-play-tic-tac-toe-in-autodesk.html">once</a>.
Do you know any similar games?

Nice!  I'm not aware of any other Vault or PLM related games.

<p>If you are doing a mass import of Items, you don’t need to do them one at a time.&#0160; The same is true for update.&#0160; You can do multiple edits at once through the REST API.&#0160; In general, it&#39;s much more efficient to do things in batch because it cuts down on network latency.&#0160; </p>
<p>If you’ve added an Item through the API, you probably noticed that the <a href="http://help.autodesk.com/view/PLM/ENU/?guid=GUID-8F2A1001-3BCE-41F8-BA81-62DB0F498126" target="_blank">POST URL</a> takes an array of ItemDetail objects.&#0160; Even if you are just adding a single Item, you still have to put it in an array.&#0160; To do a batch add, just include multiple objects in the array.</p>
<p>For Item updates, there are two endpoints: <a href="http://help.autodesk.com/view/PLM/ENU/?guid=GUID-EE4AFB1B-8E45-42C1-8B4C-9578A47712DD" target="_blank">one for batch</a> and <a href="http://help.autodesk.com/view/PLM/ENU/?guid=GUID-36270D54-8588-4F0B-BDB9-E79DDE60B728" target="_blank">one for single items</a>.&#0160; There is not much of a downside to using the batch endpoint for all item edits, even if it&#39;s just a single item.&#0160; Just like with batch add, batch edit takes an array of ItemDetail objects.&#0160; The only difference is that the objects must have ID values.</p>
<p>Example JSON of setting CITY=Paris on two Items:</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" width="470">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="470">[ <br />&#0160; {&quot;id&quot;:2913,&quot;fields&quot;:{&quot;CITY&quot;:&quot;Paris&quot;}}, <br />&#0160; {&quot;id&quot;:2912,&quot;fields&quot;:{&quot;CITY&quot;:&quot;Paris&quot;}} <br />]</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #d09219;" />
<p>All REST calls are transacted unless documented otherwise.&#0160; So batch Add/Edit will either all succeed or all fail.</p>
<p>The limit is 10 Items at a time for batch add or edit.&#0160; We’re starting out conservative, but we may decide to increase the limit in the future.&#0160; It’s still 90% better than doing things one at a time.</p>

<p>As I mentioned a <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2014/01/vdf-client-properties.html" target="_blank">few articles ago</a>, the VDF has the concept of client properties.&#0160; On top of that, the VDF gives you the ability to add your own.&#0160; The main advantage here is that it gives you a column of your very own in the VDF grid.&#0160; Beyond that, most of the work is up to you.&#0160; You need to set the value.&#0160; If you want to persist the data, that’s also up to you.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #d09219;" />
<p>Perhaps it’s best if I show a quick example.&#0160; Let’s create a property called “my prop def”, and set values based on a counter that I increment.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2014/CustomColumn/screenshot.png" /></p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Define a class the implements IPropertyExtensionProvider.</strong></p>
<p>IPropertyExtensionProvider can do a lot of things.&#0160; Here I’m using it to supply a client property definition to the VDF.&#0160; I’m also using it to provide the values to that property when the VDF asks for them.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3: Enjoy. </strong></p>
<p>You can now use the column in any of your UI that uses the VDF.&#0160; Even if a VDF grid doesn’t explicitly set the column, the property shows up in the list when the user goes to customize the columns.</p>
<p>If your app is a Vault Explorer 2014 plug-in, your custom property is <strong>not</strong> available in the main grid or any of the default tabs.&#0160; This is because those grids are not true VDF grids.&#0160; (Fun fact: The file browser on the Attach command <em>does</em> used the VDF grid, so you can see your custom properties there)</p>

EXCERPT:
As I mentioned a few articles ago, the VDF has the concept of client properties.  On top of that, the VDF gives you the ability to add your own.  The main advantage here is that it gives you a column of your very own in the VDF grid.  Beyond that, most of the work is up to you.  You need to set the value.  If you want to persist the data, that’s also up to you.

What if I want to define a custom property that was displayed as a 16x16 icon in VaultBrowserControl ?
Thank you.

I've never done it myself, but my guess is that you set the value to an ImageInfo object.

I have an article on reading the different property types.  So that should be helpful in knowing how to write them.

<p>There are two main ways to get a list of items in a workspace.&#0160; You can use the <a href="http://help.autodesk.com/view/PLM/ENU/?guid=GUID-14018953-E39F-4CA5-B069-974618231608" target="_blank">items endpoint</a> or the <a href="http://help.autodesk.com/view/PLM/ENU/?guid=GUID-BB31FFBD-3904-44A1-80C4-DDB451035617" target="_blank">query endpoint</a>.&#0160; In this article, I will be comparing and contrasting these API calls.&#0160; (Spoiler Alert: My preference is the query endpoint)</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #d09219;" />
<p>The <strong>items endpoint</strong> follows the standard REST pattern.&#0160; You make a GET call to a collection URL ( /api/v2/workspaces/{workspaceId}/items).&#0160; The return value is all items in the workspace.&#0160; The return value is a set of <a href="http://help.autodesk.com/view/PLM/ENU/?guid=GUID-AA0CFA55-6CB1-468E-8067-C49794266D63" target="_blank">Item</a> objects, which just provide basic information.&#0160; Because the payload is simple, the API call is fast.</p>
<p>At first, this endpoint seems like an ideal way to navigate workspaces, but there are some big downsides.&#0160; For one, the endpoint will return deleted Items.&#0160; This is because “deleted” Items are not actually removed from the system.&#0160; Instead, they are just tagged as deleted.&#0160; The endpoint makes no assumptions about what type of item you want to get, so it returns both deleted and non-deleted Items.</p>
<p>The items endpoint also doesn’t have any sort or filter capability.&#0160; In a large workspace, this is a significant drawback.&#0160; If you are looking for a specific item, you may have to scan through hundreds of pages in order to find it.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #d09219;" />
<p>The <strong>query endpoint</strong> is meant to give you more control over what you get back.&#0160; It lets you sort your results and lets you filter out Items you don’t want.&#0160; There is <a href="http://help.autodesk.com/view/PLM/ENU/?guid=GUID-23719984-36F0-453B-99F3-4F05B0E17FE2" target="_blank">an article on how to query</a> over on the PLM 360 online help. One common use is to filter out deleted items and sort by the descriptor name, like in this example JSON.</p>

<p>This call is a bit harder to work with because it’s a POST call.&#0160; Since a payload has to be passed in, the GET verb can’t be used.&#0160; You can’t easily test it out in your web browser, and it’s harder to cycle through pages.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #d09219;" />
<p>Although the query endpoint is slower, it’s still the one I recommend using for your apps.&#0160; The flexibility and scalability are a must-have.&#0160; There will likely be improvements in the future, so don&#39;t be too discouraged if it doesn&#39;t yet support the type of search you want.&#0160; The only time I suggest using the items endpoint is to do a quick scan of the entire workspace.</p>

Hi Doug,

I've been looking and looking for something similar to this.  Here is my dilemma.

I want an app (fast and light would be great) that lists all the files on my computer in the Vault Workspace that ARE NOT in Vault.  (Deleted from Vault, not managed by vault, all of that.)

I want to prevent anybody from cleaning out their local workspace folder blindly, assuming that they checked everything into Vault.  Sometimes you save a copy of an inventor file to test something out, or there may be CAM programs saved there, or PDF data sheets with information about a purchased part included in a design.  Some users (me included) forget to check these items into Vault, and they might get forgotten.

Is there an app for that?  I was thinking about creating a custom one, and it seems like the items endpoint might be a good quick way to get all the files in the local workspace.  Am I way off?

Sincerely,
David Fletcher

<p>The VDF tracks two types of properties: <strong>client properties</strong> and <strong>server properties</strong>.&#0160; If you have been using the web service API for a while, you are probably already familiar with server properties.&#0160; But client properties is a new concept in the Vault API.</p>
<p>Both client and server properties are displayed in the Vault grid controls.&#0160; As an end user, you probably didn’t care which was which.&#0160; But if you program with the VDF, you will start to notice and appreciate the differences.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #5acb04;" />
<p><strong>Server Properties</strong></p>
<p>These are properties that live on the server.&#0160; If you want to interact with these properties, it involves a web service call.&#0160; Likewise, adding a new property is done by making web service calls.&#0160; A server property value will be the same for all users.&#0160; Lastly, server properties are indexed and can be used in a search.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #5acb04;" />
<p><strong>Client Properties</strong></p>
<p>These properties are set by the client and are not known by the server.&#0160; Since the server doesn’t know about these properties, it can’t index or search on them.&#0160; You interact with client properties through the VDF.&#0160; You can add your own properties by implementing an interface and registering it with the VDF.&#0160; I’ll cover that in another article.&#0160; </p>
<p>Client properties may have different values depending on the user.&#0160; The file status icon is a good example.&#0160; One user may see a file as &quot;out of date&quot; while the other sees it as &quot;no local file&quot;. &#0160; </p>
<p>You can tell if a property is a client or server property by checking <strong>IsCalculated</strong> on <strong>PropertyDefinition</strong>.&#0160; That’s the VDF PropertyDefinition class, which is in Autodesk.DataManagement.Client.Framework.Vault.Currency.Properties.&#0160; Not to be confused with the web service class in Autodesk.Connectivity.WebServices.PropDef.&#0160; Anyway, if IsCalculated is true, then it’s a client property.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #5acb04;" />
<p><strong>Uses for Client Properties</strong></p>
<p>Since you can define your own client properties, the possibilities are limitless.&#0160; Out of the box, here are some of the ways that client properties are used.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Mixing client and server data</span> - The algorithm involves grabbing some server data, cross-referencing it with local data and displaying a value unique to the current user.&#0160; Examples include the File Status Icon and the File Extension Icon.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Modification of server properties</span> - This is basically a server property displayed it a different way.&#0160; Examples include (Date Only) and (Time Only) properties and the Entity Icon.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Display of non-property server data</span> - Sometimes data from a server is not a property but you want to show it in the grid.&#0160; The Path property is a good example.</p>

Hey, this goes along the subject of Properties...

I'm using the method 'GetPropertyDefinitions' out of the IPropertyManager interface, and I've found an issue...

There are 3 parameters for this method:  Entity Class Filter, Entity Category Filter, and Property Definition Filter.

The issues is this:  if I use the 1st and last parameters and leave the middle as Nothing I can get all UserDefined Properties, for say, a Folder, but the moment I put an Entity Category in the middle, I either get NO results, or if I null the 1st param, I get ALL user defined properties.  Even though in the documentation it says that it retrieves ONLY the properties for that category.

The reason this would be great is I'm programming some things to apply property values early, and I'd like to pull all User Properties according to category.  Right now I've been using a separate database, that I have to REMEMBER to update.  But I've rambled enough, maybe we could email or something.  I can show you what I've been working on.

Thanks, I really enjoy your site, it is VERY informative.

Hi Doug,

I am trying to use just the GridControl (DevExpress) itself (01:18:00 in the video). I used the sample which is shown in the PowerPoint, but the GridControl doesn't seem to have a SetDataSource method. Is there a sample project available somewhere?

You can download the Additional Materials for some code samples.  Also, VaultBrowserSample in the SDK and the latest version of Advanced Advanced Find on this blog use the grid.

FYI.  The DevExpress content is completely encapsulated by the Vault API.  You shouldn't have to reference the DevExpress assemblies directly in your code.  So make sure you are using the GridControl from Autodesk.DataManagement.Client.Framework.Vault.Forms.dll.

It´s a great tool.
My qestion: Why we cannot the result window like others in the Vault and copies the results into an excel sheet?
Is there no way to sort (e.g. by state) ? Would do the deleting easier.

Hello author,

I remember stumbling upon this tool back in 2014 when I was desperately trying to clean up my cluttered computer. "Find Orphaned Files 2014" was a lifesaver! It helped me locate and organize those forgotten files that were scattered all over my system, making my digital life so much more manageable. I can't believe it's been years since I first used it, but I still appreciate the efficiency and simplicity it brought to my file management. Thanks for the nostalgic reminder

Thank you so much for sharing your appreciation! I wonder if you know that meanwhile Vault added a system property "Has Parent"? A saved search on this property provides the same result as the legacy tool - and, resolved more wishes like navigate the files, copy & paste to Excel, ...

<li>Bug fix: Picklist values can be updated by passing in a valid picklist value.</li>
<li>Known issue:&#0160; Error is returned if you pass in a null for a picklist value.&#0160; In other words, there is no way to clear a picklist value through the API.</li>
<li>Known issue:&#0160; Error is returned if you try to set a filtered picklist value for a picklist not using the Item Descriptor.</li>

<p>There is a belief among cloud evangelists that the web interface is going to completely dominate all software.&#0160; In the future, we will all be using the web browsers for everything.&#0160; I, for one, hope that day never comes.&#0160; There is something I just like about the feel of a desktop app.&#0160; I’m used to things like right-clicking, drag-and-drop, keyboard shortcuts.&#0160; The desktop app is something I’ve missed since moving to the PLM 360 team.&#0160; With that in mind I decided to create (<em>dun-dun-DUNNNN</em>) <strong>The TTP Project</strong>.</p>

<p>Actually, a working desktop app was a secondary goal of mine, one which I didn’t quite achieve.&#0160; Although the app works, it’s not something an end user would find useful in it’s current state.&#0160; Maybe that will change in the future.</p>
<p>My main goal was to come up with a <strong>prototype SDK library</strong> for the PLM REST API.&#0160; That goal came out much better.&#0160; The PLM360Utils project has some goodies for .NET developers.&#0160; For example, with a few lines of code, you can completely bypass steps 1-7 of the <a href="http://help.autodesk.com/view/PLM/ENU/?url=/cloudhelp/ENU/PLM-360-REST-APIv2/files/GUID-1F1639DF-F8A6-45EE-885F-950C29FF1DBE.htm" target="_blank">Authentication process</a>.&#0160; The DLL does all the OAuth stuff for you so that you don’t have to.&#0160; Other features include wrappers for some REST calls and an easy mechanism for defining wrappers that I didn’t include.</p>
<p>Keep in mind this isn’t an official library or anything.&#0160; It’s just something I’m playing around with.&#0160; So let me know what you think.</p>

<p>For .NET developers, here are some highlights from the PLM360Utils.</p>
<p>You can log in with just a few lines of code... <br /><span style="font-family: Consolas;"><span style="background-image: none; background-attachment: scroll; background-repeat: repeat; background-position: 0% 0%; mso-highlight: white;"><span style="color: #2b91af;"><span style="font-size: 9pt;">LoginSettings</span></span></span><span style="font-size: 9pt;"><span style="background-image: none; background-attachment: scroll; background-repeat: repeat; background-position: 0% 0%; mso-highlight: white;"><span style="color: #000000;"> settings = </span></span><span style="background-image: none; background-attachment: scroll; background-repeat: repeat; background-position: 0% 0%; mso-highlight: white;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">new </span></span><span style="background-image: none; background-attachment: scroll; background-repeat: repeat; background-position: 0% 0%; mso-highlight: white;"><span style="color: #2b91af;">LoginSettings</span></span></span><span style="background-image: none; background-attachment: scroll; background-repeat: repeat; background-position: 0% 0%; mso-highlight: white;"><span style="font-size: 9pt; color: #000000;">( <br />&#0160;&#0160; clientId, plmUri, oxygenConsumerKey); <br /></span></span></span><span style="font-family: Consolas;"><span style="background-image: none; line-height: 10pt; background-attachment: scroll; background-repeat: repeat; background-position: 0% 0%; mso-highlight: white; mso-fareast-font-family: calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-ansi-language: en-us; mso-fareast-language: en-us; mso-bidi-language: ar-sa;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: 9pt;">m_conn = PLM360Utils.</span></span></span><span style="font-size: 9pt;"><span style="background-image: none; line-height: 10pt; background-attachment: scroll; background-repeat: repeat; background-position: 0% 0%; mso-highlight: white; mso-fareast-font-family: calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-ansi-language: en-us; mso-fareast-language: en-us; mso-bidi-language: ar-sa;"><span style="color: #2b91af;">Library</span></span></span><span style="background-image: none; line-height: 10pt; background-attachment: scroll; background-repeat: repeat; background-position: 0% 0%; mso-highlight: white; mso-fareast-font-family: calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-ansi-language: en-us; mso-fareast-language: en-us; mso-bidi-language: ar-sa;"><span style="font-size: 9pt; color: #000000;">.Login(settings);</span></span></span></p>
<p>The library will pop up UI to the user that takes them to the Autodesk single-sign-on page.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2013/TTP/loginScreen.png" /></p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>If the login succeeds, you get back a Connection object.&#0160; Connections are mainly for running Operations.&#0160; Each Operation object represents a single REST API call.&#0160; Here is an example.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Consolas;"><span style="background-image: none; background-attachment: scroll; background-repeat: repeat; background-position: 0% 0%; mso-highlight: white;"><span style="color: #2b91af;"><span style="font-size: 9pt;">GetWorkspaceCollection</span></span></span><span style="font-size: 9pt;"><span style="background-image: none; background-attachment: scroll; background-repeat: repeat; background-position: 0% 0%; mso-highlight: white;"><span style="color: #000000;"> operation = </span></span><span style="background-image: none; background-attachment: scroll; background-repeat: repeat; background-position: 0% 0%; mso-highlight: white;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">new </span></span><span style="background-image: none; background-attachment: scroll; background-repeat: repeat; background-position: 0% 0%; mso-highlight: white;"><span style="color: #2b91af;">GetWorkspaceCollection</span></span></span><span style="background-image: none; background-attachment: scroll; background-repeat: repeat; background-position: 0% 0%; mso-highlight: white;"><span style="font-size: 9pt; color: #000000;">();<br /></span></span></span><span style="background-image: none; background-attachment: scroll; background-repeat: repeat; background-position: 0% 0%; mso-highlight: white;"><span style="font-family: Consolas;"><span style="font-size: 9pt; color: #000000;">m_conn.RunOperation(operation);<br /></span></span></span><span style="font-family: Consolas;"><span style="background-image: none; line-height: 10pt; background-attachment: scroll; background-repeat: repeat; background-position: 0% 0%; mso-highlight: white; mso-fareast-font-family: calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-ansi-language: en-us; mso-fareast-language: en-us; mso-bidi-language: ar-sa;"><span style="color: #2b91af;"><span style="font-size: 9pt;">PagedCollection</span></span></span><span style="font-size: 9pt;"><span style="background-image: none; line-height: 10pt; background-attachment: scroll; background-repeat: repeat; background-position: 0% 0%; mso-highlight: white; mso-fareast-font-family: calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-ansi-language: en-us; mso-fareast-language: en-us; mso-bidi-language: ar-sa;"><span style="color: #000000;">&lt;</span></span><span style="background-image: none; line-height: 10pt; background-attachment: scroll; background-repeat: repeat; background-position: 0% 0%; mso-highlight: white; mso-fareast-font-family: calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-ansi-language: en-us; mso-fareast-language: en-us; mso-bidi-language: ar-sa;"><span style="color: #2b91af;">Workspace</span></span></span><span style="background-image: none; line-height: 10pt; background-attachment: scroll; background-repeat: repeat; background-position: 0% 0%; mso-highlight: white; mso-fareast-font-family: calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-ansi-language: en-us; mso-fareast-language: en-us; mso-bidi-language: ar-sa;"><span style="font-size: 9pt; color: #000000;">&gt; workspaces = operation.OutputPayload;</span></span></span></p>
<p>PagedCollection and Workspace are Payload objects.&#0160; PLM360Utils takes care of the JSON serialization.&#0160;</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>If you want to use a REST endpoint that doesn’t yet have an Operation object, you can easily create your own.&#0160; Just follow the pattern from the existing classes.&#0160; For example, here is the entire Operation class for updating an item.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0in 0in 0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none;"><span style="font-family: Consolas;"><span style="background-image: none; background-attachment: scroll; background-repeat: repeat; background-position: 0% 0%; mso-highlight: white;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="font-size: 9pt;">public</span></span></span><span style="font-size: 9pt;"><span style="background-image: none; background-attachment: scroll; background-repeat: repeat; background-position: 0% 0%; mso-highlight: white;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">class</span></span><span style="background-image: none; background-attachment: scroll; background-repeat: repeat; background-position: 0% 0%; mso-highlight: white;"><span style="color: #2b91af;">UpdateWorkspaceItem</span></span><span style="background-image: none; background-attachment: scroll; background-repeat: repeat; background-position: 0% 0%; mso-highlight: white;"><span style="color: #000000;"> : </span></span><span style="background-image: none; background-attachment: scroll; background-repeat: repeat; background-position: 0% 0%; mso-highlight: white;"><span style="color: #2b91af;">Operation</span></span><span style="background-image: none; background-attachment: scroll; background-repeat: repeat; background-position: 0% 0%; mso-highlight: white;"><span style="color: #000000;">&lt;</span></span><span style="background-image: none; background-attachment: scroll; background-repeat: repeat; background-position: 0% 0%; mso-highlight: white;"><span style="color: #2b91af;">ItemDetail</span></span><span style="background-image: none; background-attachment: scroll; background-repeat: repeat; background-position: 0% 0%; mso-highlight: white;"><span style="color: #000000;">, </span></span><span style="background-image: none; background-attachment: scroll; background-repeat: repeat; background-position: 0% 0%; mso-highlight: white;"><span style="color: #2b91af;">ItemDetail</span></span></span><span style="background-image: none; background-attachment: scroll; background-repeat: repeat; background-position: 0% 0%; mso-highlight: white;"><span style="font-size: 9pt; color: #000000;">&gt;</span></span></span></p>

<p>There is not much code because the Operation base class does most of the work.&#0160; The subclass just has to define things like the input type, the output type, the http verb and the URL.</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>Complex REST calls, like ones that involve binary data, are not yet supported by PLM360Utils.&#0160; So you will have to get the HttpClient from the Connection and make the REST calls directly.</p>

EXCERPT:
There is a belief among cloud evangelists that the web interface is going to completely dominate all software.  In the future, we will all be using the web browsers for everything.  I, for one, hope that day never comes.  There is something I just like about the feel of a desktop app.  I’m used to things like right-clicking, drag-and-drop, keyboard shortcuts.  The desktop app is something I’ve missed since moving to the PLM 360 team.  With that in mind I decided to create (dun-dun-DUNNNN) The TTP Project.

Very nice work Doug! Thanks. I'm looking forward to getting over this hump of work for AU, then getting stuck into making loads of mistakes and asking an excessive number of mistakes with the REST API. See you in Vegas.

<p><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/PLM4.png" /> <br /><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/TipsAndTricks4.png" /></p>
<p>The <a href="http://help.autodesk.com/view/PLM/ENU/?url=/cloudhelp/ENU/PLM-360-REST-APIv2/files/GUID-CD70000F-9F4C-47D3-87FA-CDF30BAA03D9.htm" target="_blank">basics of paging</a> are already described up on the PLM 360 online help.&#0160; But for today’s article, I’d like to go a bit deeper.&#0160; I’ll also be answering some “why did they do it that way” style questions.</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p><strong>Which endpoints support paging?</strong></p>
<p>If an endpoint supports paging, it will say so in the documentation.&#0160; In most cases, it’s a <a href="http://help.autodesk.com/view/PLM/ENU/?url=/cloudhelp/ENU/PLM-360-REST-APIv2/files/GUID-14018953-E39F-4CA5-B069-974618231608.htm" target="_blank">GET call</a>, like when getting the items in a workspace.&#0160; Page parameters are passed in as query parameters, which are part of the endpoint API documentation.&#0160; If the documentation doesn’t list any query parameters, then paging is not supported.&#0160; If you try to use paging query parameters with an endpoint that does not support paging, you will get a GEN_PAGING_NOT_SUPPORTED error.</p>
<p>Sometimes a <a href="http://help.autodesk.com/view/PLM/ENU/?url=/cloudhelp/ENU/PLM-360-REST-APIv2/files/GUID-BB31FFBD-3904-44A1-80C4-DDB451035617.htm" target="_blank">POST call</a> will support paging.&#0160; In these cases, the <a href="http://help.autodesk.com/view/PLM/ENU/?url=/cloudhelp/ENU/PLM-360-REST-APIv2/files/GUID-CAD2268B-B4B6-4100-B617-1B51CA22F3C2.htm" target="_blank">input payload</a> has the paging parameters, not the query string.&#0160; Another thing different about POST calls is that the nextUrl and prevUrl values are null in the returned PagedCollection.&#0160; Since POST calls require data in the body of the HTTP request, the URL doesn’t contain enough data to run the operation.&#0160; </p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p><strong>Going off the edge of the world</strong></p>
<p>There is no upper bound to the “page” parameter.&#0160; You can grab page 100000 if you want.&#0160; The call will succeed even if the object list finished at page 3.&#0160; Go ahead, try it.&#0160; Try the URL <strong>api/v2/workspaces/1/items?page=99999999</strong> in your tenant.</p>
<p>You get back an empty set.&#0160; You don’t get a nextUrl for obvious reasons, but it does provide a prevUrl.&#0160; This is because REST paging doesn’t yet have a totalCount feature (sorry).&#0160; So REST doesn’t know if the previous page contains items or not.</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p><strong>PagedCollection for endpoints that don’t support paging</strong></p>
<p>All collection endpoints return a <a href="http://help.autodesk.com/view/PLM/ENU/?url=/cloudhelp/ENU/PLM-360-REST-APIv2/files/GUID-BB013573-8C54-454E-94BC-C9AA0E5A872B.htm" target="_blank">PagedCollection</a> even if they don’t support paging input parameters.&#0160; This is a bit counter-intuitive, but there are a couple of good reasons why we went with this approach:</p>
<ol>
<li>Consistency across the API.</li>
<li>Allows paging to be added in the future without changing the return schema, which would be a breaking change.</li>

The basics of paging are already described up on the PLM 360 online help.  But for today’s article, I’d like to go a bit deeper.  I’ll also be answering some “why did they do it that way” style questions.

<p>Previously Vault would only load plug-ins from one location.&#0160; Starting in 2014, it now can load plug-ins from 3 locations.&#0160; Two new locations were added to support the App Manager.&#0160; So if you are creating an app for the Vault Exchange store, you can install to the locations that App Manager is used to working with.</p>
<p>Here are the 3 locations:</p>
<ul>
<li>%programData%\Autodesk\<span style="color: #ff0000;">[Vault Version]</span>\Extensions <br /><em>This path is specific to Vault</em></li>
<li>%programData%\Autodesk\ApplicationPlugins <br /><em>This path is for App Store plug-ins which are installed to all users on the computer</em></li>
<li>%appData%\Autodesk\ApplicationPlugins <br /><em>This path is for App Store plug-in which are installed to a single user on the computer</em></li>
</ul>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #d09219;" />
<p>Setting up the PackageContents.xml for the app store should be pretty straightforward for a Vault app.&#0160; The only major difference is that instead of pointing to a DLL, a Vault module should point to the .vcet.config file.&#0160; You should also have your plug-in DLLs in the same folder as your .vcet.config file.</p>
<p>Here is an example PackageContents.xml with a Vault module:</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" width="470">

<p>The Oxygen team just added a feature that allows <strong>*.autodeskplm360.net</strong> as the scope on a Consumer Key.&#0160; Previously you couldn’t have a wildcard in the front, which meant your key would only work on a specific PLM 360 tenant.</p>
<p>Now you can use the <strong>*.autodeskplm360.net</strong> scope to write apps that work with all PLM 360 tenants.&#0160; Of course, you can still scope things to a specific tenant if you want.&#0160; A narrow scope is useful for things like in-house utilities and consulting projects.</p>
<p>If you already have an Oxygen key, you can get the scope changed.&#0160; Just make another <a href="http://help.autodesk.com/view/PLM/ENU/?url=/cloudhelp/ENU/PLM-360-REST-APIv2/files/GUID-1F1639DF-F8A6-45EE-885F-950C29FF1DBE.htm">key request</a> and indicate that you want the scope updated on your existing key.&#0160; Make sure to include your public Consumer Key in the request.</p>

<p>A couple weeks ago, I blogged about the <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2013/10/the-loader-framework.html" target="_blank">Loader Framework</a>.&#0160; One of the key components of that framework is the .vcet.config.&#0160; It’s basically the file that tells the Loader what to load and how to load it.&#0160; In the knowledgebase of the SDK is the specification for the XML syntax. It’s the v3 version of schema which was introduced in Vault 2014.</p>
<p>Features include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ability to provide name/value pairs for your extension. </li>
<li>Different ways to locate referenced assemblies. </li>
<li>Ability to load an extension only in an x86 and x64 environment. </li>
<li>Different formats for identifying a .NET type. </li>
</ul>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>Below is the full spec, copied from the SDK documentation.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #d09219;" />
<h2>XML Tags:</h2>
<p><strong>&#0160;</strong></p>
<p><strong>&lt;configuration&gt;      <br /></strong>This is the top-level tag.&#0160; There should be one and only one of these tags.     <br />Required element:&#0160; 1 &lt;connectivity.ExtensionSettings3&gt;</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p><strong>&lt;connectivity.ExtensionSettings3&gt;      <br /></strong>This tag is a collection of extensions.&#0160; It is directly below &lt;configuration&gt;.&#0160; There should be one and only one of these tags.     <br />Required elements: 1 to many &lt;extension&gt;</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p><strong>&lt;extension&gt;      <br /></strong>This tag defines a component to be loaded at runtime.     <br />Required attributes:     <br />&#0160; - <strong>interface</strong> - The &quot;type name&quot; of the interface implemented by the extension.     <br />&#0160; - <strong>type</strong> - The &quot;type name&quot; of the class that implements the extension interface.&#0160; The assembly must be in the same folder as the .vcet.config file.     </p>
<p>Optional attribute:     <br />- <strong>runtime</strong> - The &quot;runtime requirement&quot; of the extension.&#0160; The default value is &quot;Any&quot;     <br />Optional elements: 0 to many &lt;setting&gt;, 0 to many &lt;resolveFolder&gt;</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p><strong>&lt;setting&gt;      <br /></strong>This tag provides meta-data for the extension in the form of a key/value pair.     <br />Required attributes:     <br />&#0160; - <strong>key</strong> - The name of the meta data.&#0160; The value must be unique within an &lt;extension&gt;     <br />&#0160; - <strong>value</strong> - The value of the meta data.</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p><strong>&lt;resolveFolder&gt;      <br /></strong>This tag provides locations to look for referenced assemblies.&#0160; This is useful if an extension references other assemblies that are not in the same folder as the extension.     <br />Required attribute:&#0160; <br />&#0160; - <strong>lookup</strong> - This is a &quot;lookup type&quot;, which determines how folders are located.     <br />Optional attribute:     <br />&#0160; - <strong>appendToPath</strong> - This is a Boolean value that determines of the resolve folder should be appended to the PATH environment variable.&#0160; This is useful when loading Win32 and COM components.&#0160; The default value is &quot;false&quot;.     </p>
<p>Lookup-specific attributes:&#0160; These attributes may be required depending on the lookup type.     <br />&#0160; - <strong>path</strong> - The path relative to the extension assembly.&#0160; Used only if the lookup value is &quot;RelativeToExtension&quot;.&#0160; <br />&#0160; - <strong>regkey</strong> - The registry key name.&#0160; Used only if the lookup value is &quot;Registry&quot;.     <br />&#0160; - <strong>regname</strong> - The name of the registry key.&#0160; Used only if the lookup value is &quot;Registry&quot;.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #d09219;" />
<h2>Value types:</h2>
<p><strong>     <br />Lookup Type       <br /></strong>This value specifies the algorithm to use when locating paths on disk.&#0160; <br />There are 3 possible values:     <br />&#0160; - <strong>ExplorerClient</strong> - The resolve path is the directory where the Vault client EXE lives.&#0160; If multiple clients are installed, it will the the highest tier product.&#0160; For example, the Vault Professional path will be used over the Vault Basic path.&#0160; If multiple client versions are installed, only the one matching the Vault framework are used.&#0160; For example the Vault 2014 framework will only resolve paths for Vault 2014 clients.     <br />&#0160; - <strong>Registry</strong> - The resolve path is located by looking up a registry key.&#0160; The registry value can be a folder path or a file path.&#0160; In the case of a file path, the parent folder becomes the resolve path.&#0160; The &#39;regkey&#39; and &#39;regname&#39; attributes are required for this lookup type.&#0160;&#0160; <br />- <strong>RelativeToExtension</strong> - The resolve path is defined relative to the assembly path.</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p><strong>Runtime Requirement      <br /></strong>This value specifies the runtime environment required for the extension to run.&#0160; <br />There are 3 possible values:     <br />&#0160; - <strong>x86</strong> - The extension can only be loaded if the running app is 32 bit.     <br />&#0160; - <strong>x64</strong> - The extension can only be loaded if the running app is 64 bit.     <br />&#0160; - <strong>Any</strong> - The extension can be loaded regardless of whether the running app is 32 or 64 bit.&#0160; This is the default option.</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p><strong>Type Name      <br /></strong>This is the identifier for a .NET type.&#0160; It is based off of the .NET syntax.&#0160; There are two possible formats. </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Simple format</strong>:&#0160; <em>FullClassName</em>, <em>AssemblyName </em></li>
<li><strong>Complex format</strong>:&#0160; <em>FullClassName</em>, <em>AssemblyName</em>, Version=<em>VersionNumber</em>, Culture=<em>CultureName</em>, PublicKeyToken=<em>PublicKeyTokenValue</em> </li>
</ul>
<p>If the complex format is used, then the version, culture and public key token must match the assembly in order for the extension to load.</p>

Hello Doug,

How can I access from my extension code to the specific settings added in my vcet.config file.

Thanks,

There is no easy way to read that data.  The vcet.config is for the plug-in loader framework.  If your app wants to store settings, I suggest doing it in another file.

<p>When it comes to API/customization features, I think of things in terms of 3 buckets:&#0160; Supported, Unsupported, and Forbidden.&#0160; Let me explain what these things mean and how they apply to the PLM 360 API.&#0160; </p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #5acb04;" />
<p><strong>Supported</strong> means it’s publically documented.&#0160; If you run into difficulties, you can expect help.&#0160; If you run into defects, you can expect them to be addressed.&#0160; If an API changes, you can expect proper notice.&#0160; </p>
<p>In the case of PLM 360, it’s easy to tell what is supported.&#0160; </p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" width="470">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="470"><strong>If it’s part of the </strong><a href="http://help.autodesk.com/view/PLM/ENU/"><strong>public documentation</strong></a><strong>, then it’s supported.&#0160; If it’s not part of the public documentation, then it’s not supported.</strong></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<br />  
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #5acb04;" />
<p><strong>Unsupported</strong> means “use at your own risk”.&#0160; Undocumented functions are the best examples of this category.&#0160; It’s something that you technically can use, but don’t expect help or documentation.&#0160; Things can change without notice.</p>
<p>In the cloud world, I highly recommend you avoid using unsupported APIs.&#0160; For an installed product, these features are less risky because you control the upgrade.&#0160; You are control when the upgrade happens and can roll back if something goes wrong.&#0160; PLM 360 doesn’t give you that flexibility.&#0160; If you use an unsupported API, you may find that your app, which was working on Friday, doesn’t work any more on Monday morning.</p>
<p>For PLM 360, the undocumented REST URLs fall into this category.&#0160; There <em>are</em> actually parts of REST v2 that are undocumented, so don’t assume that everything with <strong>/api/v2</strong> in the URL is supported.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #5acb04;" />
<p><strong>Forbidden </strong>means we at Autodesk don’t want you touching a certain part of the system.&#0160; This includes things that violate the license agreement (like reverse engineering) and things that violate data integrity (database modification in Vault).&#0160; </p>
<p>For the PLM 360 API, forbidden mainly applies to security features and things that are blatantly illegal.&#0160; Attempts to circumvent our security system and misuse of user data fall under this category.&#0160; If you are ever in doubt, <a href="http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/PLM-360-General/bd-p/705" target="_self">ask</a>.&#0160; We will be happy to point you in the right direction.</p>

<p>The PLM 360 API, like most REST API’s, have a version component to their URLs.&#0160; However, the meaning of the version changes from system to system.&#0160; So let me explain what that version means for the PLM 360 API.</p>
<p>The <strong>API version</strong> is the part you see in the URL for a REST call.&#0160; So if you are getting a list of workspaces from https://mytenant.autodeskplm360.net/api/<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">v2</span></strong>/workspaces/, 2 is the API version number.&#0160; In PLM 360, this number identifies <strong>a compatible API set</strong>.&#0160; In other words, v2 will maintain compatibility as new releases of PLM come out.&#0160; Things may be added to REST v2, but existing content will still work the same as before.</p>
<p>At some point in the future, there will be a v3 API, which will probably not be compatible with v2.&#0160; When new API versions are introduced, they will live side-by-side with existing API versions.&#0160; This gives developers ample time to move their code to the latest API version.&#0160; Here is a rough diagram of what I’m talking about. </p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2013/PlmApiVersioning/timeline.png" /></p>
<p>There is no set time for any of this.&#0160; The v3 API may come out in a year, two years, or maybe never at all.&#0160; Likewise the end-of-life for v2 is not set either.&#0160; It may be a year after v3 comes out, or two years, or maybe never.&#0160; All I can say is that the end-of-life for an API version will be announced ahead of time.&#0160; </p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #5acb04;" />
<p>The <strong>product version</strong> for PLM 360 gets updated for every major PLM 360 release, which happens about every month.&#0160; You can easily find the current version by going to <strong>/version.txt</strong> on your tenant.&#0160; At the time of writing, 9.1 is the current version.&#0160; When PLM updates, new features may be added to the API.&#0160; So if you want to name a specific API schema, you need to include both the API version and the product version.&#0160; For example, <strong>“API schema 2:9.1”</strong> or something like that.&#0160; Most of you shouldn’t have to care about exact schemas.&#0160; The API version is usually sufficient.&#0160; However, I do recommend that you record the current PLM 360 product version somewhere in your code and/or readme documentation.&#0160; It will be a helpful data point if you run into issues later on.</p>

<p>Is using a cloud API really any different than any other client/server API?&#0160; If you have developed with the Vault API, then you should already be familiar with many of the core concepts.&#0160; Things like latency, user permissions and multi-user environments all still apply to the cloud.&#0160; So is the cloud just a larger scale version of client/server programming?</p>
<p>No, there are some fundamental differences.&#0160; Differences that need to be accounted for in your code.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #5acb04;" />
<p><strong>Frequent updates, whether you want them or not&#0160; </strong></p>
<p>When a new version of PLM 360 goes live, customers have no choice but to accept the new version.&#0160; For the end-user, this is usually a good thing.&#0160; At the API level, it adds an element of instability.&#0160; Gone are the days where you get your customization running and breathe a sigh of relief, knowing that things are working and stable for the next year or two until the next upgrade.</p>
<p>PLM 360 upgrades are about every 4 weeks, and everyone gets the update.&#0160; These upgrades are not something you can plan for like with installed software.&#0160; For example, a typical Vault upgrade involves the admin testing the new version, then planning when the upgrade should take place.&#0160; PLM 360 is not like that.&#0160; It updates without warning, so you can’t plan for it.&#0160; And you definitely can’t pick the date.</p>
<p>Sometimes a Vault upgrade will go wrong and the customer will decide to stick with the older version for a while longer.&#0160; Which brings me to my next point...</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #5acb04;" />
<p><strong>You can’t go back </strong></p>
<p>Once the PLM 360 upgrade happens, that’s it.&#0160; You can’t go back to the older version.&#0160; In fact, the old version doesn’t even exist anymore.</p>
<p>This fact adds an extra complexity to debugging.&#0160; If you notice a new bug, it’s hard to determine if it’s because of a PLM update or if it’s a bug that was always there, and you just never noticed.&#0160; With a desktop app, you could always install the prior version and get a definitive answer, but you don’t get that with the cloud.</p>
<p>Sometimes it’s not a bug, but your app is... different.&#0160; For example, the data is being displayed differently or a command has different results than before... you think.&#0160; Again, it’s hard to know if it’s because of the PLM update or old age.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #5acb04;" />
<p><strong>Tips for working with the cloud</strong></p>
<p>Here are some pieces of advice for working with a cloud API.&#0160; If you have an more advice, let me know in the comment section.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Forward Compatibility</strong> - Your code should always expect the unexpected.&#0160; Avoid assumptions as much as possible.&#0160; For example, PLM 360 currently has 6 types of workspaces.&#0160; Next week, it may have 7.&#0160; You code can’t crash if it comes across a workspace type it has never seen before. </li>
<li><strong>Smoke Tests</strong> - Create an automated test of your app’s functionality.&#0160; The advantages are numerous.&#0160; You have an easy way to spot issues before users do.&#0160; You have a mechanism for pinpointing the exact failure.&#0160; Saving the smoke test results gives you a document of how things worked in past PLM 360 versions. </li>
<li><strong>Documentation</strong> - Be thorough in documenting your app’s behavior.&#0160; Record videos if you can.&#0160; If not, then take lots of screenshots.&#0160; Again, the goal is to have something to reference if you believe there is a change in behavior. </li>
</ul>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #5acb04;" />
<p><strong>The Autodesk side of things</strong></p>
<p>Obviously, we here at Autodesk also want your apps to be as stable as possible.&#0160; Here is what you can expect from us.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Backward Compatibility</strong> - Just like your app needs to be forward compatible, the PLM 360 API needs to be backward compatible.&#0160; Although content will be added to REST v2, existing content will not be changed or removed.&#0160; If a situation arises where the data model needs to change, that new model will go into REST v3. </li>
<li><strong>Defect Fixing</strong> - If you believe there is a defect in the API, <a href="http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/PLM-360-General/bd-p/705">let us know</a>.&#0160; One of the major advantages of the cloud is the ability for us to fix defects quickly. </li>
<li><strong>Developer Services</strong> - We are working on some initiatives that should alleviate some of the pain points that I mentioned.&#0160; But, I can’t say anything more at this time.&#0160; </li>
</ul>

<p>OK, great, there is an API for PLM 360.&#0160; So what can one do with it?&#0160; How is it different than scripting?&#0160; What does REST even mean?</p>
<p><strong>Ultra short definition of REST:</strong>&#0160;&#0160; <br /><em>REST allows a client to communicate with a server via HTTP.</em></p>
<p>You can <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST">read more about REST</a> if you want. But for the purposes of this article, REST means that you can write a client app that talks to PLM 360 over HTTP.</p>
<p><strong>Scripting vs REST:      <br /></strong>PLM 360 has a scripting engine for performing <strong>server-site</strong> tasks in response to certain events.&#0160; Scripting is great but it can’t integrate two systems or plug-in to AutoCAD.&#0160; For <strong>client-side</strong> operations, you need the REST API.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #d09219;" />
<p><strong>Features of the API:      <br /></strong>There are a lot of things PLM does, but not all those features are available yet in the API.&#0160; The initial focus of the API is to provide a stable framework to build on.&#0160; I believe we now have that framework, so the next steps are to add more features.</p>
<p>Current feature set:</p>
<ul>
<li>Login / logout.</li>
<li>Get all the workspaces. </li>
<li>Get detailed information on a workspace (item details tab only). </li>
<li>Get a list of all the items in the workspace. </li>
<li>Get a filtered list of items in a workspace. </li>
<li>Read data on an item (item details tab only). </li>
<li>Add / edit / delete an item. </li>
<li>Get a list of all files attached to an item. </li>
<li>Upload /download files. </li>
<li>Checkin / checkout / undo checkout of a file. </li>
</ul>
<p>Note: All operations and data are scoped to the permissions of the logged in user.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #d09219;" />
<p><strong>Uses for the API:      <br /></strong>There is enough functionality here to start writing some interesting apps.&#0160; Here are some ideas.&#0160; Some of these ideas can already be seen in sample apps.</p>
<ul>
<li>Take a picture with your mobile device and attach it to an item in PLM 360.&#0160; (see <a href="http://images.autodesk.com/adsk/files/PLMPhotoAttach-Java-src.zip">Java sample</a>) </li>
<li>CAD plug-in that pulls data from PLM 360 and uses it in the model. (see <a href="https://github.com/ADN-DevTech/PLM360-API-Samples/tree/master/Material%20Profiler%20Inventor%20Add-In%20%2B%20PLM360">Material Profile example</a>) </li>
<li>Integrations with other systems. </li>
<li>Custom views of PLM data. </li>
</ul>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #d09219;" />
<p><strong>API Updates:      <br /></strong>In theory, the API can be updated any time PLM 360 updates, and <strong>PLM 360 updates about every 4 weeks</strong>.&#0160;&#0160; That means there will be a constant stream of new API functionality.&#0160; It’s not like with Vault where you have to wait a year for API updates.&#0160; If there is a specific feature you want API support for, let us know in the <a href="http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/PLM-360-IdeaStation/idb-p/3">idea station</a>.&#0160; That will help us prioritize what to work on next.</p>

<p>If you go to <a href="http://help.autodesk.com/view/PLM/ENU/">PLM 360 Online Help</a>, you may notice a new section at the bottom.&#0160; The “<strong>REST API v2 Reference</strong>” has everything you need to get started developing client applications for PLM 360.</p>
<p>Since I’m an engineer, I’ll immediately dive in to the bad news...</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #ff0000;" />
<p>The API is in <strong>tech preview</strong> mode.&#0160; That means we are still stabilizing it.&#0160; Support is limited, and breaking API changes may occur without warning.&#0160; It’s perfect if you want to be an early adopter, but I highly discourage writing anything mission critical at this time.&#0160; Please keep your apps limited to prototypes and easy-to-update utilities.&#0160; </p>
<p>Once the API stabilizes, we will remove the tech preview restrictions and provide official support.&#0160; I have no ETA for when this will happen since stability isn’t something I want to rush.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #ff0000;" />
<p>The next piece of bad news is that you need an <strong>Oxygen key</strong> to log in.&#0160; Oxgyen is the service that let’s users log in with their Autodesk ID.&#0160; You need to first request a key.&#0160; Once you have your key, you have to write a fair amount of code to allow your app to log in to PLM.&#0160; All these steps are outlined in the “Authentication” section of the online API help.</p>
<p>The good news is that one you are logged in, the rest of the PLM 360 API is pretty straightforward.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #ff0000;" />
<p>Lastly, there is a distinct lack of <strong>API libraries</strong>.&#0160; Most of the burden is on the client developer to deal with the low level REST details.&#0160; Again, this is because the API is for early adopters.&#0160; There are some <a href="http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/ps/dl/item?siteID=123112&amp;id=22261515&amp;linkID=19386672">sample apps</a> to help you, but they don’t contain full API coverage.&#0160; If you want to do anything not shown in a sample app, you will have to write the proxy code yourself.</p>
<p>We will eventually have a set of libraries to hide the low level REST details, but I don’t have an ETA at this time.&#0160; If you are a long time reader of this blog, you know that I like to write sample apps.&#0160; So I’m <em>very</em> motivated to get these libraries in place.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #ff0000;" />
<p>If you have any questions or comments about the REST API, I suggest posting to the <a href="http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/PLM-360-General/bd-p/705">PLM 360 discussion group</a>.&#0160; Please put “REST API” in the title, so that I can easily find it. </p>
<p>Keep reading this blog for the latest PLM 360 API announcements, sample apps, articles, tips and tricks, etc.&#0160; From here on out, this blog will be covering the APIs for both Vault and PLM 360.</p>

<p>One interesting little API gem is the ExtensionLoader.&#0160; Well, it’s interesting to me because I designed it, but maybe you will find it interesting too.&#0160; I basically took the mechanism for loading plug-ins and made it public in the API.&#0160; In theory, you can make use of this tool to load extensions of your own.&#0160; Another use is interrogating the system to see which Vault plug-ins are available, where they live, what their settings are, and so on.</p>
<p>In order to be loaded by the framework, a plug-in has to meet certain requirements.</p>
<ul>
<li>The plug-in has to work through an interface.</li>
<li>The plug-in needs a class that implements the interface.</li>
<li>The loader app needs to be aware of the interface.</li>
<li>The implementing class needs a default constructor.</li>
<li>There needs to be .vcet.config file, which is what tells the loader framework about the plug-in.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you take a closer look at the .vcet.config for a 2014 plug in, you will notice that an &lt;extension&gt; contains an <strong>interface</strong> and <strong>type</strong>.&#0160; <strong>Interface</strong> can be anything you want.&#0160; IExplorerExtension, IJobHandler and IWebServiceExtension are the ones provided by the Vault API.&#0160; But the loader framework doesn’t care about that.&#0160; It will work with any .NET interface.&#0160; <strong>Type</strong> is the class that implements the interface.&#0160; The Loader creates a new instance of that class when loading the plug-in.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #d09219;" />
<p>The loader framework can be access through the ExtensionLoader, which is in Autodesk.Connectivity.Extensibility.Framework.&#0160; Here is a quick example I put together.&#0160; It’s for an EXE that prints out the Vault Explorer extensions along with their custom commands and tabs.</p>

<p>Here is what the output looks like on my computer.&#0160; As you can expect, I have a good number of plug-ins installed.</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" width="470">

<p>It’s not quite perfect.&#0160; Duplicates show up because the command/tab shows up in different contexts.&#0160; Also, DECO does have custom commands, but they are not shown here.&#0160; The reason is that the plug-in was loaded outside the context of Vault Explorer, and DECO doesn’t like that.</p>

EXCERPT:
One interesting little API gem is the ExtensionLoader.  Well, it’s interesting to me because I designed it, but maybe you will find it interesting too.  I basically took the mechanism for loading plug-ins and made it public in the API.  In theory, you can make use of this tool to load extensions of your own.  Another use is interrogating the system to see which Vault plug-ins are available, where they live, what their settings are, and so on.

Sorry, no.  You can't run out-of-the box commands from a custom command.

However there is a way to navigate to a folder when your custom command exits:  <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2012/07/gotolocation.html">http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2012/07/gotolocation.html</a>

Hi Doug, is it possible to navigate to a folder in a custom tab with a custom context menu?

No, a tab view cannot change the navigation context of Vault Explorer.

Doug, love your articles. However, I have one question about this one. Above you mentioned: •The plug-in needs a class that impalements the interface   
Did you really mean impalements? LOL! Everybody misspells a word or two every now and then.

<p>Because of the new Filestore Server architecture, logging in to Vault 2014 takes up more steps than it did before.&#0160; If you are using the WebServiceManager or Connection object, fell free to skip this article because the extra steps are performed automatically for you.&#0160; But if you are making direct calls to the web service URLs, then keep reading.&#0160; I’ll outline the new steps for logging in.</p>
<p>First, make sure you understand the <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2013/06/vault-filestore-server.html">AVFS architecture</a>.&#0160; Even if everything is installed on the same computer, your code needs to see Vault as two separate servers.&#0160; The link above also lists which services are on which server.</p>
<p>The SignIn calls are in the AuthService and WinAuthService, which are part of AVFS.&#0160; If you are showing a login dialog to the user, for example, then the user is expected to type in the name of the Filestore Server, not the Data Server.</p>
<p>If you are logging in with Vault username/password, use the AuthService.&#0160; If you are logging in with Windows credentials, use WinAuthService.&#0160; Depending on the needs of your app, use either SignIn(), SignIn2() or SignInReadOnly() to authenticate. </p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #d09219;" />
<p>Once you are authenticated, you need to figure out where the Data Server is located.&#0160; You do this by calling IdentificationService.<strong>GetServerIdentities</strong>, which returns an array of ServerIdentities.&#0160; Each ServerIdentity represents a Filestore Server and it’s related Data Server.&#0160; There may be multiple results if there are multiple filestores installed.&#0160; </p>
<p>Find the ServerIdentity that matches the filestore you just authenticated to.&#0160; Remember the DataServer value, because that is the server to call for all web services on the data server.&#0160; </p>
<p>Once you have it set up&#0160; so that each web service calls are going to the correct server, you mostly don&#39;t have to worry about about the different server types.&#0160; The glaring exception is file IO, which I explain in my article: <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2013/07/file-transfer-doing-it-the-hard-way.html">File Transfer - Doing it the Hard Way</a>.</p>

Sorry no.  It only runs in the 2014 client.
However, the source code is available, so somebody may decide to update it for the 2016 version.

I have working app on 2015 Vault. Now I try update it to 2016, it works with files and folders, but I still need to find how change removed methods…
bool useACL = conn.WebServiceManager.ItemService.GetUseACLForItemLifeCycleStates();
                            ACL itemACL = conn.WebServiceManager.ItemService.GetItemLifeCycleStatesACL();

The "Changes" page in the SDK docs should tell you what to use for removed functions.  I apologize if this was not done.

GetUseACLForItemLifeCycleStates is no longer a global setting.  You can read the StateBasedSec value off the LfCycState object.  Call LifeCycleService.GetLifeCycleStatesByIds to get the lifecycle state object.


GetItemLifeCycleStatesACL has been replaced with LifeCycleService.GetStateACLByLifeCycleStateId.

<p>Here are some AU classes and events for the technically oriented readers of my blog.&#0160; If you are a Vault programmer, AU is a good opportunity to get up to speed on PLM 360 and its APIs.</p>
<p>NOTE:&#0160; PLM 360 scripting and REST API are two completely different things.&#0160; People with little to no programming experience can benefit from scripting.&#0160; However, the REST API is much more complex and is geared toward programming professionals.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #ff0000;" />
<p>Let’s start with the content that I’ll be presenting:</p>
<p><strong>DevDays - Las Vegas - MFG Breakout Session</strong> - I’ll be going over the upcoming features in Vault.&#0160; I’ll also be going over PLM 360 for those that haven’t used it yet.&#0160; Since this is for developers, emphasis will be placed on programming and customization.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://events.au.autodesk.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=1518" target="_blank">DV1518</a> - Programming PLM 360 using REST</strong> - I’ve been working on this API for many months, so I’m looking forward to helping people get started writing custom applications.&#0160; </p>
<p><em>At the time of this writing, the PLM 360 REST API is only available to early adopters, but that may change by the time AU rolls around.</em></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://events.au.autodesk.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=1670" target="_blank">DV1670</a> - Programming the Vault with the VDF</strong> - I’ll be co-presenting this class with Dennis Mulonas, who is one of the architects on Vault.&#0160; We’ll go into the new Vault 2014 features, with emphasis on the Vault Development Framework.&#0160; </p>
<p><a href="https://events.au.autodesk.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=2227" target="_blank"><strong>DV2227</strong></a><strong> - Autodesk Cloud and Mobile API/Technologies: Meet the Experts</strong> - We gathered up all the experts on the various Autodesk cloud APIs and put them together in one room.&#0160; So come with your questions, or just sit back and listen to what others are doing.&#0160; I’ll be on the panel to field any PLM 360 questions.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #ff0000;" />
<p>Here are classes being presented by others:</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://events.au.autodesk.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=2948" target="_blank">MA2948</a> - High Dividend on Autodesk PLM 360 Exchange Apps</strong> - The cloud nature of PLM 360 makes this app store a bit different than for other Autodesk products.&#0160; However, there is still great opportunity for developers to “get in on the action.”</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://events.au.autodesk.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=2758" target="_blank">PL2758-P</a> PLM 360 Automation Solutions with Scripting</strong> - Get an in-depth look at scripting in PLM 360 and how it can enhance your processes.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://events.au.autodesk.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=2760" target="_blank">PL2760-L</a> PLM 360 Developers Delight - A hands on PLM 360 Scripting overview</strong> - A lab on PLM 360 scripting.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://events.au.autodesk.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=1628" target="_blank">UT1628-R</a> - Practical Integration Between Autodesk AutoCAD Utility Design and Autodesk Vault Professional</strong> - I have no idea what this is about, but it looks cool.&#0160; I’ve attended Dan Leighton’s classes in the past, and they have always been awesome.&#0160; </p>

<p>You can divide my career at Autodesk into two parts.&#0160; The part before Autodesk University and the part after.&#0160; No single event has had as much impact.&#0160; Of course, the fact that I work for Autodesk had a lot to do with it.&#0160; So individual results may vary.</p>
<p>Pre AU, I was mostly your average computer programmer.&#0160; People would give me features to code, and I would code them.&#0160; I pretty much relied on management to tell be what was important in the product and how people used the product.&#0160; I did not yet have a blog or a YouTube channel.&#0160; However, some interesting things were starting up.&#0160; Vault Mirror, my first “app,” was up on Autodesk Labs, and I was actively participating with the newly created discussion group for Vault.&#0160; But AU put those initiatives in high gear.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #666666;" />
<p>The year was 2006, and one of my tasks was managing the Vault API, so ADN invited me over to show it off for DevDays.&#0160; I decided to stay for the whole week and attend as much Vault-related content as possible.</p>
<p>The classes themselves were stuff I already knew, but the real benefit for me was after the class. People would hang around after the class to talk to the instructor.&#0160; This gave me a chance to listen and talk to people, which I don’t usually get do to as a programmer.</p>
<p>The amount of information I gained from those simple conversations was amazing.&#0160; It changed my view of the product and how people use it.&#0160; Sure, at a technical level the product is the same, but it’s not always clear how technical details come together to form a useful product.</p>
<p>Even outside the classes, I was able to have good interactions.&#0160; At lunch, I’d sit with a bunch of strangers.&#0160; After seeing from my badge that I worked at Autodesk, the conversations would pretty much go like this...</p>
<p>“So you work at Autodesk, what do you do?”</p>
<p>“I work on the Vault product.”</p>
<p>“Vault?&#0160; I think I may have heard of it.&#0160; What does it do, exactly?”</p>
<p>“Well, let me tell you...” </p>
<p>And before I knew it, I turned into a salesman. It’s not something I would want to do every day, but it was still a welcome change from day-to-day programming work.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #666666;" />
<p>The main stage event blew me away.&#0160; Before then I had no idea just how <em>cool</em> Autodesk is.&#0160; Sure the Media and Entertainment division is a big help with their 3D animation software.&#0160; But the geeky CAD stuff was just as cool to me.&#0160; Cities designed in 3D, factory floor simulations, etc.&#0160; Not many companies could pull off that kind of presentation, so I felt privileged to be part Autodesk.</p>
<p>This is probably the only part of AU that has lost it luster for me.&#0160; I still enjoy the main stage events, but they don’t pack nearly the same punch as the first one.&#0160; Although I was very happy to see Vault an PLM get some time on the main stage last year.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #666666;" />
<p>After that first AU, things changed for me.&#0160; I still spend most of my time programming, but my role expanded in ways I couldn’t comprehend.&#0160; A significant portion of my time now goes to API training and support.&#0160; Maybe those changes would have happened anyway, but AU was definitely a tipping point.</p>
<p>I’ve been back to AU four times since then, and I learn something new each time.&#0160; Most of my apps are inspired by my interactions with customers and resellers.&#0160; But there are intangible benefits too.&#0160; Every feature I code is influenced, sometimes at a sub-conscience level, by those interactions.&#0160; I can’t wait for this year’s AU.</p>
<p>See you there. </p>

<p>Although AU is just 3 days long, there are plenty of events going on before and after.&#0160; One such event is DevDays, which is put together by the <a href="http://www.autodesk.com/joinadn" target="_blank">Autodesk Developer Network</a>.&#0160; <a href="http://au.autodesk.com/las-vegas/pre-conference/adn-conference-devlab" target="_blank">DevDays</a> is the Monday before AU, and I highly recommend checking it out.&#0160; There you will learn about updates to all the major products, cloud APIs (present and future), mobile apps, and desktop apps.&#0160; It’s definitely worth coming in a day early for (not that you need an excuse to stay an extra day in Vegas).</p>
<p>I will be there in the Manufacturing breakout session going over Vault updates and the new PLM 360 REST API.&#0160; So feel free to say hi, talk shop about Vault and/or PLM 360 development, get my autograph, etc.</p>
<p>If you can’t make it to AU, there is a good chance DevDays will be coming to a <a href="http://developer-days.autodesk-services.com/" target="_blank">location near you</a> soon.</p>

<p>In writing <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2013/09/vault-web-view-2014.html" target="_blank">Vault Web View 2014</a>, I came across a problem.&#0160; I wanted to store a common configuration for some custom tab settings.&#0160; The standard way to do this is with a Vault Option.&#0160; The problem is that custom tabs are registered <em>before</em> Vault Explorer logs in to Vault.&#0160; So how do I set up the custom tabs or custom commands if I can’t read the Vault Option?</p>
<p>A couple other people have run into this same problem, so I’d like to go over my solution.&#0160; It’s nothing fancy or anything.&#0160; It’s just a message telling the user to restart Vault Explorer.&#0160; This technique works for custom commands, tabs and custom entity handlers.</p>
<p>Vault Web View deals with 2 copies of the config settings.&#0160; One copy is kept locally as an XML file in the same folder as the extension DLL.&#0160; The other copy is XML data stored in a Vault Option.&#0160; When Vault Web View sets up the tabs, it does it based off of the local settings file.&#0160; </p>

EXCERPT:
In writing Vault Web View 2014, I came across a problem.  I wanted to store a common configuration for some custom tab settings.  The standard way to do this is with a Vault Option.  The problem is that custom tabs are registered before Vault Explorer logs in to Vault.  So how do I set up the custom tabs or custom commands if I can’t read the Vault Option?

<p>I decided it was time to bring back Vault Web View.&#0160; The concept is pretty simple.&#0160; The app provides a tab with a web control in it.&#0160; The web page shown is based on the selected object.</p>
<p><a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2013/VaultWebView/fullscreen.png" target="_blank"><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2013/VaultWebView/scaled.png" /></a>     <br /><span style="color: #666666;">(click image for full view)</span></p>
<p>New for Vault 2014.&#0160; You can now have multiple tabs.&#0160; And you can determine which tabs show up on which entity types.&#0160; Lastly, you can use any Vault property or properties to determine the URL.&#0160; </p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2013/VaultWebView/Configure.png" /></p>
<p>How it works is the admin sets up the URL for the tab.&#0160; Anything in { } gets replaced by the property value in the selected object.&#0160; So you can build up URLs based on Vault properties.</p>
<p>So, if a tab is set to “http://www.{sitename}.com” and you select an object where the <strong>sitename</strong> property is <strong>autodesk</strong>, you will see <a href="http://www.autodesk.com">http://www.autodesk.com</a> in the tab view.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #013181;" />
<p><strong>Requirements:</strong>     <br />Vault Workgroup/Professional 2014</p>

<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #013181;" />
<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The resulting URL value must start with &quot;<strong>http://</strong>&quot;.&#0160; Otherwise you won&#39;t see anything in the tab view. </li>
<li>If an object is in a folder, the folder properties can also be used in the URL.&#0160; How it works is the selected object properties are applied first to the URL.&#0160; Next, the parent folder properties are applied to the URL.&#0160; This way if a property is empty in the selected object, the folder can provide the value. </li>
<li>If there are empty property values required by the URL, then nothing will show up in the tab view. </li>

Doug, 

Is there a technical reason why the Top Level Domain can't be part of the Text Property? As it is you would need a tab for each one.... .net .com co.uk .co.nz .com.au etc etc. Since there are so many it seems like this would be a reasonable limitation towards practically using this feature.

Cheers

Scott

You can put anything you want in a text property.  There is no limitation.  I just used "http://www.{sitename}.com" as an example of how data gets substituted.

If the entire web address is a property value, then you set the URL to "{web address}".

Sorry, but I don't understand the question.  Please post your question to the Vault API discussion group:  
<a href="http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/Vault-Customization/bd-p/301">http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/Vault-Customization/bd-p/301</a>

In the discussion group, you can post the code that is giving you problems.  You can also include screenshots.  I find that these things are helpful in communicating the problem.

The requirements you noted are: "Vault Basic/Workgroup/Professional 2014".  Does that mean we write client add-ins for Vault Basic in 2014?

No, it means I made a typo.  Sorry, the app won't work with Vault Basic because Vault Basic still doesn't support plug-ins.  
I'll fix the page.

Hi Doug,

just asking if you still select this one to stay alive or is it coming to and end of life soon? It is a nice application which is useful within vault to shao additional content - like if this object has relations to a cloud store or representation in another application (when web based)
Any plans from your side ?

Hi Dough,

Your articles/blogs are very helpful. I am pretty new to Vault integrating PLM360 to Vault 2016 using jitterbit. 

Want to use this Web View to give our users a better user experience, so that they do not have switch applications.

Is there a 2016 version of this app?
Or do I need to download the app and make changes to make it 2016 compatible?
If it is the second option any guidance will help. Appericiate your help and advice.

Thanks,
Ravi

Sorry, there's no 2016 version.  You need to download the source and update the app. 

I can't think of any other option if you want to view a PLM page inside of the Vault client.

I don't know much about the Jitterbit integration.  I'm assuming that the Vault object will have properties on it, such as DMSID, that allow you to build the PLM url.  If you don't have that, then Web View won't be much help.

<p>Working Folder is another one of those concepts that is more complex than you would expect it to be.&#0160; At it’s core, things are pretty simple, you map a local folder to a Vault folder.&#0160; That way Vault clients know were to upload and download files to.&#0160; The complexity comes from additional features that are built on or around this concept. I’ll try to detangle everything by listing the various features related to working folder and their related APIs.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #ff5a00;" />
<p><strong>Per-folder setting      <br /></strong>If you right-click on a Vault folder and select Details, you will see the local folder that corresponds to that Vault folder.&#0160; By default, the $ folder is mapped to a folder in your user settings.&#0160; Also by default, a sub-folder is mapped based on the parent folders mapping.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2013/WorkingFolder/PerFolder.png" /></p>
<p>You can override the default settings.&#0160; So a sub-folder on disk may not necessarily correspond to the the parent folder on disk.&#0160; In fact, you can even reverse the order so that the sub-folder in Vault is the parent file on disk.&#0160; </p>
<p>These settings are stored in an XML file on your local computer.&#0160; The easiest way to access that data is through the function Connection.WorkingFoldersManager.<strong>GetWorkingFolder()</strong>.&#0160; It takes care of all the calculations for you and gives you the same path you see in the Folder Details dialog.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #ff5a00;" />
<p><strong>Enforced working folder      <br /></strong>The Vault administrator can enforce a root working folder.&#0160; This setting has the effect of overwriting any folder mappings set in the Folder Details window.&#0160; An enforced working folder only gets applied to the root and all sub-folders are based off the root setting.&#0160; </p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2013/WorkingFolder/enforced.png" /></p>
<p>When an enforced working folder is in effect, the user is prevented from setting a working folder in the Vault client.&#0160; However, the API function Connection.WorkingFoldersManager.<strong>SetWorkingFolder()</strong> still works, so be careful.&#0160; The next time the user logs in through the Vault Explorer client, it will overwrite anything you changed with SetWorkingFolder.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #ff5a00;" />
<p><strong>Inventor project files      <br /></strong>Inventor ignores any mappings you set through the Vault client.&#0160; Instead it uses the .ipj file to map Vault folders to your local folders.&#0160; So the GetWorkingFolder() won’t help you when working with Inventor. You need to either read the .ipj contents or use the Inventor API to figure out what the mappings are.</p>
<p>Since the .ipj file is critical for almost every Inventor operation, Vault has a special setting that you can use to locate the .ipj file.&#0160; In the DocumentService there are two functions you can use to get at this data.&#0160; <strong>GetEnforceInventorProjectFile()</strong> tells you if there is an .ipj file set to be used by the entire Vault.&#0160; <strong>GetInventorProjectFileLocation()</strong> gives you the Vault path to the enforced .ipj file.</p>

I have a problem with working folder.
If I set the working folder anything other than the default working folder and get the file from vault as it explain here and a few other pages, all the file get downloaded properly. But when I open the assembly in Inventor, Inventor tries to find the file in the folder that was created.
For example:
If in D:\Vault\Folder1, there are ASM1.ism that has part1.ipt, part2.ipt and while downloading, I specify it to be downloaded to D:\Vault\Folder2, the three files will be downloaded to the new folder and every thing seems to be ok. However, when I open the assembly file in the new folder (Folder2), it still opens the parts in Folder1.

If I use "Autodesk Vault Basic" that comes with Inventor, it does it correctly and update the reference, but using API, I had no success.

Here is my code:
            Dim fname As String = dlg1.LookIn.Text + "/" + dlg1.FileName.Text
            Dim file1 As Autodesk.Connectivity.WebServices.File()
            file1 = connection.WebServiceManager.DocumentService.FindLatestFilesByPaths({fname})
            If file1.Length <> 0 Then

                Dim oFileIteration As VDF.Vault.Currency.Entities.FileIteration = Nothing
                oFileIteration = New VDF.Vault.Currency.Entities.FileIteration(connection, file1(0))
                If oFileIteration Is Nothing Then
                    MsgBox("Error: Can't find the file")
                    Exit Sub
                End If
                Dim oSettings As VDF.Vault.Settings.AcquireFilesSettings =
                                                  New VDF.Vault.Settings.AcquireFilesSettings(connection)
                'Going to Checkout and download
                oSettings.DefaultAcquisitionOption = VDF.Vault.Settings.AcquireFilesSettings.AcquisitionOption.Download
                oSettings.OptionsRelationshipGathering.FileRelationshipSettings.IncludeChildren = True
                oSettings.OptionsRelationshipGathering.FileRelationshipSettings.RecurseChildren = True
                oSettings.OptionsRelationshipGathering.FileRelationshipSettings.VersionGatheringOption = _
                VDF.Vault.Currency.VersionGatheringOption.Latest

                oSettings.LocalPath = New VDF.Currency.FolderPathAbsolute("D:\Vault\Designs\temp-v") 'connection.WorkingFoldersManager.GetWorkingFolder(oFileIteration)

                oSettings.AddEntityToAcquire(oFileIteration)

                oSettings.LocalPath = New VDF.Currency.FolderPathAbsolute("D:\Vault\Designs\temp-v") 'connection.WorkingFoldersManager.GetWorkingFolder(oFileIteration)
                connection.FileManager.AcquireFiles(oSettings)


            End If

<p>If you have played around with the new Grid Control, you may have noticed that there is a column for the status icon.&#0160; It’s a highly useful piece of information that is difficult to calculate.&#0160; The good news is that you can leverage the 2014 API to give you this data, either in icon form or object form.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2013/StatusIcon/screenshot.png" /></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #ff5a00;" />
<p><strong>Client side properties:</strong></p>
<p>The status icon is an example of a client-side property.&#0160; It’s not something the server can do because it requires data from your hard-drive.&#0160; There are many factors that go into the status image, including comparing the state of the local file with the state of the corresponding file in Vault.&#0160; So, if you are looking for an easy way for your app to see what files are out of date, the status property gives that to you easily.</p>
<p>You can’t search on client-side properties, since the server controls the search feature.&#0160; You also can’t use any of the web service functions because those functions only deal with server-side data.&#0160; You need to use VDF libraries (Autodesk.DataManagement.*) in order to work with client-side properties.&#0160; </p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #ff5a00;" />
<p><strong>Getting the icon:</strong></p>
<p>If you are displaying the grid, the control itself will take care of displaying the icon.&#0160; But if you want to use the icon in your own UI, there is a way to get it.&#0160; It’s probably best if I just start with the code and then explain what the code is doing.</p>

</td>

</table>
<p>Step one is to get the VDF PropertyDefintion for the status information.&#0160; I do this by first calling Connection.PropertyManager.GetPropertyDefinitions and grabbing all file-related PropertyDefinitions.&#0160; This is a VDF function, so I get back both client and server property definitions.&#0160; The return object is indexed by ID and system name.&#0160; So, it’s easy to look up a property if I know the system name.&#0160; In the case of Vault status, the ID is defined in PropertyDefinitionsIds.</p>
<p>The last step is to call GetPropertyValue for on my FileIteration object.&#0160; The function returns an Object, which I convert to EntityStatusImageInfo.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #ff5a00;" />
<p><strong>EntityStatusImageInfo</strong></p>
<p>This is a very useful class.&#0160; Not only does it give you the Image object itself, but it gives you a data structure describing the status.&#0160; So you can, for example, write special logic for cases where the local file version doesn’t match any vault version (ie. edited out of turn).</p>
<p>You can call GetImage to get an Image object that you can display in your UI.&#0160; The algorithm for calculating that image is surprisingly complex, so it’s good do have a functions that does the calculation for you.&#0160; Because this is the same code used by the clients, your icon will match the icon seen in Vault Explorer and the CAD plug-ins.   <br /><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/TipsAndTricks3-1.png" /></p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>:&#0160; I&#39;ve just been informed that Microsoft stopped using the word using the term Metro.&#0160; The current term is &quot;Windows Store Apps&quot; or something like that.&#0160; </p>
<p>Last December, my Christmas present to myself was a Windows Surface tablet.&#0160; In typical me-style, I decided to write an app for it.&#0160; Overall, it was a pain getting the app to work.&#0160; I expected it to be easy to write a Microsoft tablet app using Microsoft Visual Studio and the Vault API, which is built on Microsoft .NET.&#0160; Alas, no, it was a pain to get the app working.&#0160; </p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2013/Metro/screenshot.png" /></p>
<p>Requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Visual Studio 2012</li>
<li>Windows 8</li>
<li>Vault 2014</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/Apps/Metro/VaultFolderBrowse-src.zip" target="_blank">Click here for the source code</a>    <br />Compiled app not available</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #013181;" />
<p>The app itself is a simple folder browser.&#0160; Nothing fancy.&#0160; I just wanted to figure out the steps for getting the Vault API to work.&#0160; I basically took the “Grid App” template project from VS and modified it to work with Vault. Let me take you through the app...</p>
<p><strong>None of the Vault SDK libraries work</strong></p>
<p>The Connection object, the WebServiceManager, IExplorerUtils, none of those work for a Metro app.&#0160; The Vault SDK DLLs require .NET libraries not present in Metro.&#0160; If you want the Vault objects, you will have to go “old school” and set of the service references directly.&#0160; </p>
<p>It’s always annoying going from a full set of libraries (Winforms/XAML) to a subset of libraries (Metro).&#0160; I understand why this is needed, but it baffles me why some things are left out.&#0160; Android has a reduced set of Java libraries, but it doesn’t <em>feel</em> that way when you are programming with it.&#0160; In a perfect world, Metro would be that way too.  </p>
<p>Anyway, to set up your Vault service objects (DocumentService, AuthService, etc), you need to add Service References in your VS project.&#0160; You do this by right-clicking on your project and selecting Add Service Reference.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2013/Metro/ServiceSetup-scaled.png" /></p>
<p>First, you need to insert the address of the web service.&#0160; In Vault 2014, there are 2 main locations for web services.&#0160; <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2013/06/vault-filestore-server.html" target="_blank">Filestore services</a> are located at     <br /><span style="color: #c0504d;">http://[serverName]/autodeskdm/services/<strong>filestore</strong>/v18/[serviceName].svc</span>.&#0160; And all other web services are at     <br /><span style="color: #c0504d;">http://[serverName]/autodeskdm/services/v18/[serviceName].svc</span> .</p>
<p>If everything goes well, clicking Go should show you a list of functions for that service.&#0160; Before you click OK, make sure you set the namespace to something useful.&#0160; You are going to have multiple services for any given Vault app, so the namespace needs to be clear.</p>
<p>To log in you will need the AuthService, which is in the filestore URL path.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #013181;" />
<p><strong>The SecurityHeader</strong></p>
<p>VS generated the SecurityHeader class, but it didn’t hook it up to anything.&#0160; The SecurityHeader is pretty important.&#0160; It contains your user’s session information.&#0160; Vault requires this information on almost every web service call.&#0160; That’s how Vault knows that who you are so that it can apply permissions.&#0160; If you can’t send the SecurityHeader, you can’t use the Vault API.&#0160; Period.</p>
<p>If you set a Service Reference in a normal VS project, the SecurityHeader is hooked up for you automatically.&#0160; I have no idea why a Metro app is different.&#0160; I had to spend most of my time, searching around on how to manually read/write header data on your web service calls.</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:&#0160; Set the [XMLRoot] attribute      <br /></strong>When you set up a Service Reference, Visual Studio auto-generates a bunch of files.&#0160; Go into the Reference.cs file for your AuthService.&#0160; You will need to “Show All Files” if you want to see it in your VS project.&#0160; Find the SecurityHeader class and replace the [System.Xml.Serialization.XmlTypeAttribute] attribute with this:</p>

<p>Save that securityHeader object. You will need it for all other Vault calls.</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Using the header</strong></p>
<p>Now that we are logged in, we can actually start reading/writing Vault data.&#0160; On every call we need to set the securityHeader.&#0160; It’s basically the same steps from part 2 but in reverse.</p>
<p>In my sample, I wrap all the calls in a delegate.&#0160; </p>

<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>That’s it for now.&#0160; I used up all my time figuring out the security header stuff, so the app itself isn’t much to speak of.&#0160; I left out a bunch of things like multi-threading, logging out of Vault, error handling, cashing and useful functionality.&#0160; I’ll leave it to you to figure all of those things out if you want to write a Metro app.</p>

EXCERPT:
Last December, my Christmas present to myself was a Windows Surface tablet.  In typical me-style, I decided to write an app for it.  Overall, it was a pain getting the app to work.  I expected it to be easy to write a Microsoft tablet app using Microsoft Visual Studio and the Vault API, which is built on Microsoft .NET.  Alas, no, it was a pain to get the app working.

<p>No surprises here.&#0160; The app is a good concept, but just didn’t pan out.&#0160; I like to write apps that fill functionality holes in Vault.&#0160; But scripting isn’t something I can build-in with an app.&#0160; </p>

<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>Based on the results, the obvious conclusion is to kill it.&#0160; The one person who said they used vLogic in production didn’t specify what it’s being used for.&#0160; The source code is available for those who what to keep it alive.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; </p>
<p>Thanks again to everyone who took the survey.</p>

<p>My blog is no longer the one and only place to get Vault API information on the web, and that’s a good thing.&#0160; Every now and then I like to highlight some of the recent articles that you should take a look at...</p>
<p><a href="http://wikihelp.autodesk.com/Vault/enu/Help/Help/0378-Develope378/0379-Vault_De379" target="_blank">VDF section on the Vault Wiki</a> - There are about 8 articles here covering a variety of topics on the VDF.</p>
<p>
<a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/manufacturing/2013/07/vault-2014-iexplorerutil-vb-example.html">Vault 2014 - IExplorerUtil VB example</a> - Sample code for how to use IExplorerUtil.UpdateFileProperties(), which allows you to update mapped file properties.&#0160; It’s a useful function, but tricky to use.&#0160; Wayne Brill, from ADN, provides sample code to get you up and running.
</p>
<p><a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/manufacturing/2013/06/use-or-with-defaultacquisitionoption-to-download-checkout-with-acquirefiles.html">Use | “OR” with DefaultAcquisitionOption to Download &amp; CheckOut with AcquireFiles</a> - It’s not obvious from the Vault documentation, but some of the enums can be joined together. You will need to know this if you want to download and checkout in the same AcquireFiles call.</p>
<p><a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/manufacturing/2013/06/get-webservicemanager-in-a-vault-event-handler.html">Get WebServiceManager in a Vault Event handler</a> - Inside of a Vault Explorer Command event, it’s not very obvious how to start making calls to the Vault server.&#0160; This article shows you a simple way to get a WebServiceManager.
</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.coolorange.com/2013/07/15/updating-references-with-vault-2014-api/">Updating References with Vault 2014 API</a> - The guys at coolOrange show how you can use the VDF to trigger an update of references for your CAD files on disk.&#0160; The VDF is supposed to automatically update references on download, but there are cases where you will want to do this step explicitly in your code.</p>
<p><a href="au.autodesk.com/?nd=material&amp;session_material_id=64848" target="_self">AU class handout - Empower users with custom Vault Explorer extensions</a> - Dan Leighton takes you through a consulting project he did using Autodesk Vault and its API.&#0160; This document perfectly bridges the gap between &quot;getting started with the API&quot; and &quot;using the API on a real project.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong>&#0160; The survey is closed.&#0160; Thanks to everyone who participated.&#0160; Here are <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2013/08/vlogic-survey-results.html" target="_self">the results</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2012/03/vlogic-2013.html" target="_blank">vLogic</a> app, my attempt at adding scripting to Vault, didn’t really turn out as I had hoped.&#0160; The scripts are difficult to write and debug.&#0160; I didn’t get much response on the app either.&#0160; So I’m thinking of not updating it for 2014, but I thought I would give the community a chance to speak up.&#0160; </p>
<p>I put together a quick survey to help me decide if I should keep it or kill it.&#0160; (Of course, the source code is available, so anybody can put out their own update if I decide to “kill” it.)</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>If you are integrating Vault and another system, you will probably want to use Persistent IDs.&#0160;&#0160; Like the name implies, these identifiers are persisted and will not change in the future.&#0160; </p>
<p>Persistent IDs came out in Vault 2013 as an undocumented feature.&#0160; For Vault 2014, it’s now being officially supported.&#0160; Before Vault 2013, there was no guaranteed way to store a reference to an entity.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #ff5a00;" />
<p><strong>Non Persistent IDs</strong></p>
<p>Let me give you some examples of non-persistent IDs to illustrate why a new feature was needed.</p>
<p><strong>File Name</strong> - Files can be renamed.     <br /><strong>Property Values</strong> - The values can be changed in new releases.&#0160; Old releases can be purged.     <br /><strong>File ID and MasterID</strong> - These are the database keys, which may need to change if the database gets re-designed.&#0160; This did actually occur during the Vault 3 -&gt; 4 migration.&#0160; That was 8 releases ago, but it could happen again.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #ff5a00;" />
<p><strong>API Usage</strong></p>
<p>The Persistent ID feature is handled by 2 functions in the KnowledgeVaultService: GetPersistentIds and ResolvePersistentIds.</p>
<p><strong>GetPersistentIds</strong> gives you the PersistentIds for a set of entities.&#0160; There are two types of IDs you can get: History and Latest.&#0160; History gives you an ID to a specific version of an entity.&#0160; Latest gives you a version independent ID, which is basically a persistent Master ID.&#0160; If an entity is not versioned, then either type gives you the same result.</p>
<p>Be careful when using History.&#0160; If you have an ID to a version that gets purged, then that ID will not be able to get resolved.&#0160; </p>
<p><strong>ResolvePersistentIds</strong> takes a set of Persistent IDs and gives you back the entity IDs and types.&#0160; If the Persistent ID is a Latest type, then you get back the latest version of the entity.&#0160; A History type results in a specific version of an entity being returned.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #ff5a00;" />
<p><strong>Other Details</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Persistent IDs only work for <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2011/09/entities-and-behaviors.html" target="_blank">entities</a>, which are Files, Folders, Items, Change Orders and Custom Objects. </li>
<li>Persistent IDs are unique for a given Vault, but not across multiple Vaults. </li>
<li>Some non-entity classes, such as Property Definitions and Categories, use a <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2012/04/system-name-vs-display-name.html" target="_blank">System Name</a> as a non-changing identifier. 
<ul>
<li>System Names are persistent in the sense that they cannot be changed by a user and will not change in future releases.&#0160; So you can safely store these outside of Vault. </li>
<li>System Names are not compatible with the GetPersistentIds and ResolvePersistentIds functions. </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

What about IDs that are used in links for objects in new Thin Client (<a href="http://crackingthevault.typepad.com/crackingthevault/2013/10/vault-2014-subscription-release-1-thin-client-url.html)?">http://crackingthevault.typepad.com/crackingthevault/2013/10/vault-2014-subscription-release-1-thin-client-url.html)?</a>
Is it possible to generate them using API?

Yes!  The new web client uses persistent IDs.  So you can use the API to generate links to an entity in Vault.

Please advise how the persistent id is referenced in the thin client.  Google resources for the vault are thin at best.

Hello Doug,

Have you received my comment about Peristent Ids not working in replicated environment from last week ?

For your information, ADN case reply:
It seems an issue to me, we have logged Change Request number BF-009082 with our development team as this issue requires a modification to our software. 

I just wanted to inform you in the hope that you know how this works internally so i could lookout for a workaround.  


Thanks in advance.
PS.: We have met in Portland at the Dev Days.

Yes I'm aware of the issue.  In fact, I'm the one who logged the defect.

There is no workaround for this issue.  I've recommended that Vault put out a hotfix to address the issue.  I have no ETA on when the fix will be available.

<p>Thanks to everyone who took my survey.&#0160; Here are <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2013/VideoSurvey/VideoSurvey.png" target="_blank">the results</a> if you are interested.&#0160; </p>
<p>My basic takeaway is that a long video with full content is better than a short video with less content.&#0160;&#0160; This means that there won’t be many changes to how I create my videos.&#0160; I will still focus more on showing the content and less on the video length.</p>
<p>Although there is room for improvement, my videos are providing useful information to the community.&#0160; So it’s definitely worth the effort for me to keep making them.&#0160; I’ll try to improve the videos as best I can, but I also have to be mindful of my time.&#0160; I can’t spend all day making videos, so I have to do the best I can with the time that I can find.</p>

Hello Doug,

an idea was to use your Vault Mirror Utility with A360 to upload specific folder, category or file extension on our Cloud.
At this time, I've tried to launch a commande line with "/?" to get all arguments and see any explanations to use the argument -WF, but it does not get me any tips...

At this time, I've got this and it works like a charm. But I would like to tune up a bit:

<i>"C:\ProgramData\Autodesk\ApplicationPlugins\Autodesk Vault Mirror 2014.bundle\Contents\V2014\VaultMirror.exe" 
-PartialMirror -U Administrator -P "" -S WIN-E4U80S6K99H -V ASDK-VAULT-2015 -F "C:\Users\masureb\AppData\Local\Autodesk\Autodesk Sync\Cloud\masureb\_Vault Mirror CS" -L "C:\Users\masureb
\AppData\Local\Autodesk\Autodesk Sync\Cloud\masureb\_Vault Mirror CS\VaultMirror.log" 
-noFail<i>

The readme file contains most of the documentation, including the command line arguments.  But it still doesn't go into much detail.

-WF downloads the files to your working folder location.  It's for people who want to use Vault Mirror like workspace sync.
For most cases, I recommend -F which lest you specify a separate download location.  That way the mirror files are separate from files you may be working on.

Hello Doug,

I am fresh meat to the Vault Administration world and was looking for a way for our sales n such to view the idw's in our vault without the need for vault on every pc. Awesome. Simple. Well done, thanks very much for sharing! I am having a problem with the Partialmirror Switch. We use a scheduled task to run vault mirror. It is run with administrative access. The scheduled task looks like this:

Program: "C:\ProgramData\Autodesk\ApplicationPlugins\Autodesk Vault Mirror 2015.bundle\Contents\V2015\VaultMirror.exe"

Arguments: -PartialMirror -U Administrator -P xxxx -S WS2008R2 -V innotech -L "C:\Innodat\vaultlog.txt" -F "C:\Vault" –nofail

The user running the task has full permissions to the folder C:\Vault. The log file logs a clean run. If I run a full mirror, change an ipt file, then check the ipt back into the vault it is not mirrored. It does not matter whether I run vaultmirror manually or from the scheduled task. The idw was updated. Any ideas?

Thanks very much,

Adam

<p>The main reason for the change was the <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2013/06/vault-filestore-server.html" target="_blank">file store server architecture</a>.&#0160; The database server controls things like security and the file store server controls the actual bits.&#0160; So you need to make at least 2 calls for every file transfer.&#0160; Also, there are special headers that need to get set on each call.&#0160; They were optional in the last release but they are required for 2014.</p>
<p>It’s probably best if I just post the code...   <br /><a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/Files/LegacyFileTransfer/LegacyFileTransfer.cs">LegacyFileTransfer.cs</a>&#0160; <br /><a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/Files/LegacyFileTransfer/LegacyFileTransfer.vb">LegacyFileTransfer.vb</a></p>

<p>One of the neat things about the UI components in the SDK is that they are also used by the Vault clients.&#0160; This means that when the product gets localized, the SDK components get localized automatically.</p>
<p>All you need to do is grab the satellite assemblies and distribute them with your app.&#0160; Oh wait, you don’t need to do that.&#0160; Dan Dulzo has already done this for you.&#0160; Thanks Dan.</p>
<p><a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/Files/LanguagePacks/Vault2014SDKLocalizedResourceDLLs.zip" target="_blank">Click here to download the Vault 2014 API Language Pack</a></p>
<p>This should include all the langauges that Vault supports.&#0160; If we missed one, let us know.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #5acb04;" />
<p><strong>When to use      <br /></strong>You should only use this for EXEs you write or when plugging in to a non-Autodesk application.&#0160; If you are plugging in to an Autodesk product, the localization pack(s) should already be in place.</p>
<p><strong>How to use      <br /></strong>In the zip file are a bunch of folders with language codes for names.&#0160; Grab the folders you want and place them under your EXE folder.&#0160; For example, if your app is installed at c:\myApp\Program.exe, then your German language back would be at c:\myApp\de.</p>
<p>Don’t feel you need to have one language folder.&#0160; Feel free to dump them all in your EXE folder.&#0160; At runtime, Windows will load the appropriate language pack based on the OS settings.&#0160; If your language isn’t in the language pack, the UI defaults to English, but you knew that already.</p>
<p>This language pack only supplies localizations of UI in the Vault SDK.&#0160; Any UI you create yourself will have to be handled by you.&#0160; </p>

One of the neat things about the UI components in the SDK is that they are also used by the Vault clients.  This means that when the product gets localized, the SDK components get localized automatically.

All you need to do is grab the satellite assemblies and distribute them with your app.  Oh wait, you don’t need to do that.  Dan Dulzo has already done this for you.  Thanks Dan.

Our company decided to develop own serch utility.
Features desired:
1. Search with custom PS script.
2. Subscribe to search results (including 1).
First is already done. Second is real but tricky. If use WatchFolder techology - the security of JP seems to be at risk - custom PS script could kill JP. Do you have any ideas on how it could be done without security risks?

Let me repeat the problem to make sure I understand.  You want to automatically run a script that sends out search results, but you want to filter those results on the user's permissions.  

There is no easy way to do this.  You would need to...
1. Grab the ACLs on all the files.
2. Grab all the users/groups and their roles.
3. Go through each file in the result set and determine if the user has access to that file.
4. Repeat step 3 for each user that you are sending results to.

Step 3 is a very complex algorithm, but my Effective Permissions app has some code you might be able to use.  Personally, I don't like using PowerShell for something that complex.


Another approach would be to run the query client-side.  For example, when the user logs in to Vault Explorer, the query runs in the background.  That way, the Vault Server does the security check for you.

With this tool is there anyway to Search for items and files where a property like "Number" equals another property like "Drawing Number"?  In the value field I tried to put Drawing number in quotes, brackets, and arrows but no luck.


Thanks

Sorry, the "value" part of a search condition is always a fixed set of text.  It's a requirement from the underlying search engine.

<p>Welcome to my 256th blog posting.&#0160; If you are one of my loyal readers, you probably already know why that is significant.&#0160; Regardless, I’ll be “celebrating” by going over the filestore server...</p>
<p>One of the major architecture changes in Vault 2014 is the filestore server.&#0160; In order to explain this architecture, I need to first explain how things worked in 2013.&#0160; </p>
<p>If you had a multi-site environment in Vault 2013, it looked like this.    <br /><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2013/FileStoreServer/oldArch.png" /></p>
<p>There is a problem with this architecture, every time you need data from the database, you need to go through two hops.&#0160; Just about everything you do in Vault requires the database, so the extra hop is significant.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #5acb04;" />
<p>For Vault 2014 the architecture, was updated to look like this.    <br /><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2013/FileStoreServer/newArch.png" /></p>
<p>DB calls go directly to the database, so it’s only one hop.&#0160; That efficiency comes at a cost however.&#0160; The new architecture is more complex.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #5acb04;" />
<p>Things that may be confusing:</p>
<ul>
<li>This architecture is always in place, even for Vault Basic and single-site installs.&#0160; It’s just easier to have 1 architecture. </li>
<li>For multi-site, a client will actually be talking to two different servers. </li>
<li>You log-in to the filestore server. </li>
<li>Internally the WebServiceManager or Connection object asks the filestore server where the database server is located. </li>
<li>File upload/download operations require communicating with both servers.&#0160; Again, the Connection object handles the details internally. </li>
<li>For backward compatibility purposes, the filestore server handles all 2012 and 2013 web service calls. You need to use the 2014 API if you want the one-hop behavior.</li>
<li>There are now two sets of server log files.&#0160; vlog is for database server issues and AVFS-log is for filestore issues.&#0160; Even on a single server you see these two logs.</li>
</ul>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #5acb04;" />
<p>The functionality is broken down by web service.&#0160; So some services are on the database server and some are on the filestore server.&#0160; There are no services that show up on both, with the exception of the <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2010/11/the-information-service.html">Information Service</a>.</p>
<p>Filestore services:</p>
<ul>
<li>AuthService </li>
<li>FilestoreService </li>
<li>FilestoreVaultService </li>
<li>IdentificationService </li>
<li>InformationService </li>
</ul>
<p>Database services:</p>
<ul>
<li>AdminService </li>
<li>BehaviorService </li>
<li>CategoryService </li>
<li>ChangeOrderService </li>
<li>ContentService </li>
<li>CustomEntityService </li>
<li>DocumentService </li>
<li>DocumentServiceExtensions </li>
<li>ForumService </li>
<li>InformationService </li>
<li>ItemService </li>
<li>JobService </li>
<li>KnowledgeVaultService </li>
<li>LifeCycleService </li>
<li>PackageService </li>
<li>PropertyService </li>
<li>ReplicationService </li>
<li>RevisionService </li>
<li>SecurityService </li>
</ul>
<p>The URLs are different too depending on which server you are talking too.&#0160; Database services are <a href="http://[server]/autodeskDM/services/v18/[service].svc" title="http://nov-depot/autodeskDM/services/v18/DocumentService.svc">http://[server]/autodeskDM/services/v18/[service].svc</a> while filestore services are <a href="http://[server]/autodeskDM/services/filestore/v18/[service].svc" title="http://nov-depot/autodeskDM/services/filestore/v18/authService.svc">http://[server]/autodeskDM/services/filestore/v18/[service].svc</a>. But you shouldn’t have to care about that if you are using WebServiceManager or Connection.</p>

<p>Technically it’s called the VaultBrowserControl, but everyone refers to it as <strong>The</strong> <strong>Grid Control</strong>.&#0160; Sure, you can build other grid controls, but there is no point.&#0160; The Grid Control does everything you want.&#0160; The version in the VDF is actually an <em>improved</em> version over the main grid in the Vault Explorer client.&#0160; </p>
<p>I can’t do justice to all the features of this control, so I bought in the developer lead on the VDF.&#0160; Please give a warm internet welcome to Michael Foster.</p>

In the Vault-Help (VDF - Vault Browser Control) is the talk of "Context Menu: The control provides a default set of entries based on where the user clicked."
But when i implement the Grid i don't get any Context-Menu. (do i have to enable it or something else?)
Isn't there a way to get the same Context-Menu i get in the Vault-Explorer.

You should be getting a context menu for a grid.  Try right-clicking in the whitespace.  The default menu will have things like "Customize columns".

The default context menu is not the menu that Vault Explorer uses.  There is no way to use the context menu from Vault Explorer.

<p>In an effort to address some long standing Job Processor issues, some major changes were made in 2014.&nbsp; At the time of this writing, there are <em>still</em> some issues being worked on, so be sure to read the workarounds at the bottom of the post.&nbsp; But let’s start with the good news.</p>
<hr style="color: #5acb04;" noshade="noshade" />
<p><strong>All settings are in .vcet.config</strong></p>
<p>In previous releases, you would have to update the XML in JobProcessor.exe.config so that it knew about your custom job types.&nbsp; This was an annoying extra step in deploying you plug-in.&nbsp; For Vault 2014, the .vcet.config format was overhauled (along with the loading mechanism for plug-ins) so it was a good time to slip in a feature that allowed Job Processor to read the job types directly from .vcet.config.</p>
<p>The new .vcet.config allows for meta-data in the form of key/value pairs.&nbsp; Job processor looks for keys that start with “JobType” and associates those types with your plug-in.&nbsp; You can have as many types as you want, just make sure to keep the key names unique.&nbsp; Name your keys like “JobType1”, “JobType2”, “JobType3” and so on.</p>
<p>Example (the parts in red are what you edit in your project):</p>
<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2" width="470">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="470" valign="top">
<p>&lt;configuration&gt;            <br />&nbsp; &lt;connectivity.ExtensionSettings3&gt;             <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;extension             <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; interface="Autodesk.Connectivity.JobProcessor.Extensibility.IJobHandler, Autodesk.Connectivity.JobProcessor.Extensibility, Version=18.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=aa20f34aedd220e1"             <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; type="<span style="color: #ff0000;">MyNamespace.MyClassName</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">MyAssemblyName</span>"&gt;             <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;setting key="JobType1" value="<span style="color: #ff0000;">MyJobType</span>"/&gt;             <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;setting key="JobType2" value="<span style="color: #ff0000;">AnotherJobType</span>"/&gt;             <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/extension&gt;             <br />&nbsp; &lt;/connectivity.ExtensionSettings3&gt;             <br />&lt;/configuration&gt;</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<br />
<hr style="color: #5acb04;" noshade="noshade" />
<p><strong>More command line options</strong>  </p>
<p>You can never be rich or have too many command line options.&nbsp; In 2014, you can now set username, password and server from the command line using -u, -p and -s respectively. If you are using Windows authentication, use -w.</p>
<p>Example:&nbsp; JobProcessor.exe -u Administrator -p pwd123 -s MyVaultServer    <br />Example:&nbsp; JobProcessor.exe -w -s MyVaultServer</p>
<hr style="color: #5acb04;" noshade="noshade" />
<p><strong>Connectivity.JobProcessor.Delegate.Host.exe</strong></p>
<p>To make JobProcessor.exe more stable, all the unstable operations were moved to a different process.&nbsp; All plug-ins now run in Connectivity.JobProcessor.Delegate.Host.exe, that way if a job crashes or leaks memory, the problem can be handled.&nbsp; And by “handled”, I mean that JobProcessor just kills the delegate process and starts another one.&nbsp; In fact, JobProcessor will periodically kill and restart the delegate just to be on the safe side.</p>
<p>So what does this mean for your plug-in...</p>
<ul>
<li>To debug, you need to attach to the running&nbsp; Connectivity.JobProcessor.Delegate.Host.exe.&nbsp; You can’t launch this process on your own.&nbsp; If you run against JobProcessor.exe, your breakpoints won’t activate. </li>
<li>If you are saving data in memory, keep in mind that the entire process may be killed and restarted. </li>
<li>Only one delegate exe will be running at any given time.&nbsp; And, jobs are still run single-threaded.&nbsp; So you don’t have to worry about your code running in parallel with other jobs. </li>
<li>The OnJobProcessorStartup and OnJobProcessorShutdown events trigger on the startup and <em>graceful</em> shutdown of the delegate process.&nbsp; If there is a crash, there may not be a shutdown event. </li>
</ul>
<hr style="color: #5acb04;" noshade="noshade" />
<p><strong>Open issues and workarounds</strong></p>
<p><strong>Problem:</strong> AcquireFiles hangs when running inside of a job.&nbsp; You may see errors like “Cannot evaluate expression because the current thread is in a sleep, wait, or join”.     <br /><strong>Cause:</strong>&nbsp; The VDF was initialized as a UI app, which is the default setting.&nbsp; We are working on a fix.     <br /><strong>Workaround:</strong>&nbsp; While the fix is being worked on, you can set the VDF to non-UI mode with the below line of code.&nbsp; It won’t hurt anything if multiple plug-ins call this code.&nbsp; And the code won’t harm anything after the fix is released.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Autodesk.DataManagement.Client.Framework.Library.Initialize(false);</span></p>

I would like to know the Pro's and Con's and whether Autodesk prohibts this but that is can you run the Job Processor on the ADMS server ? I know it takes up a license but the speed gain seems like a benefit , our courrent reseller does not recommend doing this but there reasons seem kind of week , what is Autodesk stance on this ?

Autodesk also recommends separate servers for Job Processor and ADMS.  However, there is nothing that prohibits you from putting them both on the same server.

Job Processor will consume a Vault license regardless of what server it is running on.

All client/server data is transferred through HTTP, regardless of where Job Processor is installed.  Therefore Job Processor should be just as fast on a separate machine in the same local network (assuming the local network is not unusually slow).

<p><strong>Registration:</strong> Reserve your place by June 11 by sending an email to <a href="mailto:%20adn-training-worldwide@autodesk.com?subject=Exchange_Apps_webinar">adn-training-worldwide@autodesk.com</a> with <em>Exchange Apps webinar</em> as the subject.

<p>If you don’t know what to build, that’s OK, <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/sample-applications/">I have plenty of apps you could write</a>.&#0160; That’s right, you can take one of my apps, update it for the latest Vault release, put it on the app store, and charge for it.&#0160; I’m totally OK with that!&#0160; It’s a win for you (extra cash from some else’s code), a win for Vault (more functionality) and a win for me (I don’t have to update the app).&#0160; </p>
<p>All I ask is that you don’t use the orange “Ones and Zeros” logo and you include your company in the name (ex. MyCo’s Hyperlink Maestro).&#0160; </p>
<p>If you don’t want to steal my code, you can also get plenty of ideas from the <a href="http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/Autodesk-Vault-IdeaStation/idb-p/2">Vault Idea Station</a>.&#0160; I frequently visit that site and say “I could write an app for that, if I only had the time.”</p>

<p>If you just got a Vault Collaboration tattoo, I’ve got bad news for you.&#0160; The product is no longer there in the 2014 release.&#0160; The 2014 product line consists of only Vault Basic, Workgroup and Professional.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2013/VaultCollab/tattoo_scaled.jpg" />    <br /><span style="color: #888888;"><em>Oh well, at least my Google Reader tattoo will never go out of style.</em></span></p>
<p>I will be focusing on the technical content, like I always do.&#0160; If you have questions about pricing, support and migration, see your reseller.&#0160; My understanding is that things have been adjusted to make the Collab-&gt;Pro transition as smooth as possible for existing customers.</p>
<p><strong>Feature set</strong></p>
<p>There has been no impact on the product feature sets.&#0160; Vault Basic, Workgroup and Professional still have all the features they did from before.&#0160; Items and Change Orders can be hidden in Vault Pro if you are not interested in those features.</p>
<p><strong>Impact on the API</strong></p>
<p>There are some spots in the API that still reference Vault Collaboration.&#0160; The decision to remove the product was made after the API was locked down.&#0160; The Vault Collab stuff should not affect the API; it should just be dormant code.&#0160; If you experience any issues, let us know.</p>
<p><strong>Custom Objects all around</strong></p>
<p>My biggest problem with Vault Collaboration was that A) it didn’t have custom objects, and B) the AEC community was encouraged to use that product.&#0160; As a result, the AEC customers did not have custom objects, which is one of the most powerful tools for Vault customization.</p>
<p>With Vault Collab gone, AEC customers are being moved to Vault Professional.&#0160; That means your apps can use custom objects all you want without alienating any industry group.</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>That’s all I have on this topic.&#0160; It’s pretty straightforward.&#0160; Now if you’ll excuse me, I have an appointment at the laser center.</p>

<p>This time around I just ported the app to 2014 and didn’t add any new features.&#0160; So have a look at the <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2012/08/project-thunderdome-2013.html">Thunderdome 2013</a> to get a feel of the full feature set.&#0160; Looking over the 2013 comments, some people mentioned that the Grid State only applied to the main grid.&#0160; I tested things out in 2014 and Grid State seems to also apply to the default tabs, such as History.&#0160;</p>

Just an idea, but do you think you could add Vault Data Standard as your Deco app in the deployement? it's like Xaml but for files and item ;)

It will be brilliant!

Cheers,

That's a pretty good idea.  I'm just getting up-to-speed on Data Standard myself.  But Thunderdome is a good candidate for transferring the custom dialogs and scripts.

<p>Things changed just enough to be annoying when updating your plug-in to Vault 2014.&#0160; So I thought I would make a quick video on how to update your app.&#0160; This is actually me updating DECO 2013 to 2014, which makes for a good real-world example.&#0160; </p>
<iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/-DI6M_2oCd4" width="420"></iframe>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>Here is a quick summary of my steps, which can be done in any order:</p>
<ul>
<li>Updated my file and assembly version numbers (optional) </li>
<li>Updated my references to use the Vault 2014 SDK DLLs. </li>
<li>Added reference to Autodesk.DataManagement.Client.Framework.dll </li>
<li>Added reference to Autodesk.DataManagement.Client.Framework.Vault.dll </li>
<li>Deployed to %ProgramData%\Autodesk\Vault <strong>2014</strong>\Extensions </li>
<li>Changed the class implementation from IExtension to IExplorerExtension. </li>
<li>Updated code to use Connection object instead of creating a WebServiceManager from the VaultContext. </li>
<li>Fixed any compile errors from web service API changes.</li>
<li>Removed any code that held a reference to a WebServiceManager. </li>
<li>Updated .vcet.config file. </li>
<li>Updated the ApiVersion assembly attribute. </li>
</ul>

<p>The Vault 2014 SDK contains a bunch of DLLs from a third-party vendor, DevExpress.&#0160; Autodesk and DevExpress entered into an agreement for usage and distribution of these DLLs in the Vault SDK.&#0160; Here is my understanding of that agreement.&#0160; Keep in mind that I do not represent the Autodesk legal department.</p>
<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p>The Vault 2014 API contains re-usable UI components, which make use of DevExpress controls.&#0160; Therefore those controls needed to be included in the Vault SDK.</p>
<p><strong>The Agreement</strong></p>
<p>The DevExpress DLLs in the Vault SDK (these are the ones in the bin folder that start with “DevExpress”) are free for you (the user of the Vault SDK) to use and re-distribute within the context of the Vault SDK.&#0160; </p>
<p>However, if you use the DevExpress controls directly, then you need to get a developer license from DevExpress.&#0160; Things like cost, and usage are between you and DevExpress.&#0160; Autodesk has no involvement.</p>
<p>If you try to make direct use of DevExpress controls without a license, you should see a pop-up in Visual Studio indicating unlicensed usage.</p>
<p>DevExpress website:&#0160; <a href="http://www.devexpress.com/" title="http://www.devexpress.com/">http://www.devexpress.com/</a></p>
<p><strong>Examples</strong></p>
<p>If you paste a VaultBrowserControl in your dialog, that’s free, even though VaultBrowserControl makes use of DevExpress controls internally.</p>
<p>If you paste a DevExpress.XtraGrid control in your dialog, you need a DevExpress developer license.</p>
<p><strong>DLL Redistribution</strong></p>
<p>The Vault Client installs all the needed DevExpress controls into the GAC.&#0160; So if your app requires the Vault Client, then you don’t need to re-distribute the DevExpress DLLs.&#0160; It’s only in cases where the user may not have the Vault Client that you need to worry about re-distributing the DLLs.&#0160; </p>
<p>Although the DLLs can go in the GAC, I recommend putting the DevExpress DLLs in the running folder.</p>
<p><strong>Special Thanks</strong></p>
<p>Thanks goes out to the people at DevExpress.&#0160; Not only did they let us include their DLLs in he Vault SDK, but they also make good controls.&#0160; Since the very first Vault release, the Vault client has been using DevExpress controls to great satisfaction.</p>

<p>Downloading and checking-out is <em>so</em> last year.&#0160; The fashionable Vault API developer <em>acquires</em> their files.&#0160; It has more style and class.&#0160; Also, DocumentService.DownloadFile and DocumentService.CheckoutFile are no more in the 2014 API.&#0160; So that kind of forces the issue.&#0160; Connection.FileManager.AcquireFiles is the replacement.&#0160; I’ll go over the architectural reason for the change in a later article.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #ff5a00;" />
<p><strong>Benefits of AcquireFiles</strong></p>
<p>Yes, it’s a pain to have to update your code, but let me go over the benefits before you get too distraught.&#0160; </p>
<ul>
<li>Downloads files to the working folder by default. </li>
<li>Automatically handles large files. </li>
<li>Automatically repairs broken references for known CAD file types. </li>
<li>Can download entire assemblies in one call. </li>
<li>Multi-thread download.&#0160; It’s about 2x quicker when downloading an assembly. </li>
<li>Get/checkout dialog available. </li>
<li>Automatically sets file attributes, such as read-only and create date. </li>
</ul>
<p>The only disadvantage that I have come across is that you can’t read a file directly into memory.&#0160; You always acquire to a location on disk.&#0160; The workaround is to acquire to a temp location, read the file to memory, then delete the temp file.</p>

EXTENDED BODY:

EXCERPT:
Downloading and checking-out is so last year.  The fashionable Vault API developer acquires their files.  It has more style and class.  Also, DocumentService.DownloadFile and DocumentService.CheckoutFile are no more in the 2014 API.  So that kind of forces the issue.  Connection.FileManager.AcquireFiles is the replacement.  I’ll go over the architectural reason for the change in a later article.

hello Doug,

It can download entire assemblies in one call, but i'm curious if it is possible todownload all drawings from assembly reference documents in one call?

You are referring to .idw files on an Inventor assembly?  Yes you can download those as part of the assembly download.  One of the various AcquireFilesSettings allows you to specify the FileRelationshipGatheringSettings.  If IncludeRelatedDocumentation is set to true, it should download the drawing files.

love the examples.
Is it possible to check out the entire assembly with this method. My code will download iam, ipt and idw files but if i use the checkout option it only checks out the iam file.

You need to set DefaultAcquisitionOption on the settings object.

Doug

thanks for the reply.

played around with the defaultAcquisitionOption but not sure how the AddFileToAcquire actually uses this as it requires a an acquisitionOption as the second parameter. It did check out the assy and parts but did not download them. Im looking at checking out and downloading all objects in 1 easy step.

here is my code - obviously not getting something

Settings.LocalPath = fldrPath
Settings.OptionsRelationshipGathering.FileRelationshipSettings.IncludeChildren = True
Settings.OptionsRelationshipGathering.FileRelationshipSettings.RecurseChildren = True
Settings.OptionsRelationshipGathering.FileRelationshipSettings.IncludeRelatedDocumentation = True
Settings.OptionsRelationshipGathering.FileRelationshipSettings.VersionGatheringOption = Autodesk.DataManagement.Client.Framework.Vault.Currency.VersionGatheringOption.Latest
Settings.DefaultAcquisitionOption = VDF.Vault.Settings.AcquireFilesSettings.AcquisitionOption.Checkout 
Settings.AddFileToAcquire(oFileIteration, Autodesk.DataManagement.Client.Framework.Vault.Settings.AcquireFilesSettings.AcquisitionOption.Checkout)

Dim results As VDF.Vault.Results.AcquireFilesResults = vaultConnection.FileManager.AcquireFiles(Settings)

You can "or" together multiple AcquisitionOptions just like a bitfield.

Hi doug

Got back onto this after I had decided to use the downloaddialogue method for awhile. What I would like to do is to determine the files that will be wrapped up with the acquirefiles prior to actually downloading/checking them out. The reason is we would like to change the state of the corresponding files back to "draft" before they are checked out by the user. I cant do it after the case because it wont let me change the state when the files are checked-out. I was hoping the "noaction" option may stil provide a result list that i could use to pre-process the files and change their state. Any suggestions.

I have been reading the documentation covering aquirefileExtensibilityOptions and am lost!! Is there any examples of how to use the preAcquire event. I was wondering if this could possibly be a solution for preprocessing files

Offhand, I don't have any sample code for you.  In general, I suggest not making any updates within an event.  The reason is that your actions may affect the operation in progress.  It's like trying to fix a table while standing on the table.

Here is the order of operations that I suggest:
1. Run AcquireFiles in noAction mode
2. In your event handler, read all the files being updated and store them in a list.
3. AcquireFiles exists
4. Go through your list and perform the needed operations.
5. Run AcquireFiles again to check out the files.  No event handlers are needed this time.

thanks doug. I was trying the noAction mode to try and identify what documents would be acquired prior to acyually doing it. Everytime i tried it i would get no acquireResults back so I gave up and have resorted to the getLatestAssociatedFileePathsByMasterIds method.

Hi Doug,

nice sample, but what about Inventor standard parts? 
How do I get out of the vault?

If you are download an assembly, I would expect the standard parts automatically come down.

If you just want to grab all the standard parts on their own, I think you have to interrogate the IPJ to look-up the Vault paths to the library folders.

Hi Doug,
All the examples I can find use userpassword credentials.  How do you use WinAuthCredentials?

For Vault 2013 and earlier...
Instead of creating a new UserPasswordCredentials object, you create a new WinAuthCredentials object.  After that,everything is the same.  You pass the credentials object into the constructor for WebServiceManager.

The code would look something like this...
UserPasswordCredentials cred = new UserPasswordCredentials("theServer", "theVault");
WebServiceManager mgr = new WebServiceManager(cred);


For Vault 2014 and later...
For a non UI login, use Autodesk.DataManagement.Client.Framework.Vault.Library.ConnectionManager.LogIn(..)
To prompt the user to login, use
Autodesk.DataManagement.Client.Framework.Vault.Forms.LogIn(..)

Hi Doug,
i use the param VersionGatheringOption and set it to Latest, but sometimes the AcquireFiles download an old version of the file.
What is the reason? 

Thanks..

That option is for downloading related files.  It does not apply to the FileIteration that you provide as the input.  In that case, it download the version on that FileIteration.

Call FileService.GetLatestFilesByIterationIds to get the latest version of the file and use that to start the download.

If that's not the solution to your problem, then I suggest posting to the Vault Customization group.  That way it's easier for you to post sample code, screen shots, etc.

I am sorry but I have to say, this is the next big step backward. Removing the most important function “DownloadFile” and replacing it with pseudo intelligent layers. And I am not even talking about noobish implementation of the new API layer. Vault web services API was one of the few if not the only clear API within Autodesk universe. 2015 rip vault API. Really sad.

Hi Doug,
In my external program, user select a row in the VaultBrowserControl. Selected row has EntityClass.Id == "FILE" (it can be a file or a file link).

This is my code to acquire the file from Vault:
---------------------------------------------------------
VDF.Vault.Settings.AcquireFilesSettings settings = new VDF.Vault.Settings.AcquireFilesSettings(conn);

settings.LocalPath = new VDF.Currency.FolderPathAbsolute(tmpPath);

settings.AddFileToAcquire(fileIter, VDF.Vault.Settings.AcquireFilesSettings.AcquisitionOption.Download);

VDF.Vault.Results.AcquireFilesResults afResults = conn.FileManager.AcquireFiles(settings);
---------------------------------------------------------

No error, the file is downloaded, but when "fileIter" is a file  link (not just the file, in this case it works) the file name in the LocalPath is truncated in its first character.

I forgot to set some option ?
Thank you.

That does not sound like intended behavior.  If you are an ADN member you should log the issue with them.  Otherwise you can post the issue on the Vault API discussion group <a href="http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/vault-customization/bd-p/301">http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/vault-customization/bd-p/301</a>

In the meantime, the workaround is to fix the file name after the download is complete.

Hi Doug:
I have a problem with working folder.
If I set the working folder anything other than the default working folder and get the file from vault as it explain here and a few other pages, all the file get downloaded properly. But when I open the assembly in Inventor, Inventor tries to find the file in the folder that was created.
For example:
If in D:\Vault\Folder1, there are ASM1.ism that has part1.ipt, part2.ipt and while downloading, I specify it to be downloaded to D:\Vault\Folder2, the three files will be downloaded to the new folder and every thing seems to be ok. However, when I open the assembly file in the new folder (Folder2), it still opens the parts in Folder1.

If I use "Autodesk Vault Basic" that comes with Inventor, it does it correctly and update the reference, but using API, I had no success.

Here is my code:
            Dim fname As String = dlg1.LookIn.Text + "/" + dlg1.FileName.Text
            Dim file1 As Autodesk.Connectivity.WebServices.File()
            file1 = connection.WebServiceManager.DocumentService.FindLatestFilesByPaths({fname})
            If file1.Length <> 0 Then

                Dim oFileIteration As VDF.Vault.Currency.Entities.FileIteration = Nothing
                oFileIteration = New VDF.Vault.Currency.Entities.FileIteration(connection, file1(0))
                If oFileIteration Is Nothing Then
                    MsgBox("Error: Can't find the file")
                    Exit Sub
                End If
                Dim oSettings As VDF.Vault.Settings.AcquireFilesSettings =
                                                  New VDF.Vault.Settings.AcquireFilesSettings(connection)
                'Going to Checkout and download
                oSettings.DefaultAcquisitionOption = VDF.Vault.Settings.AcquireFilesSettings.AcquisitionOption.Download
                oSettings.OptionsRelationshipGathering.FileRelationshipSettings.IncludeChildren = True
                oSettings.OptionsRelationshipGathering.FileRelationshipSettings.RecurseChildren = True
                oSettings.OptionsRelationshipGathering.FileRelationshipSettings.VersionGatheringOption = _
                VDF.Vault.Currency.VersionGatheringOption.Latest

                oSettings.LocalPath = New VDF.Currency.FolderPathAbsolute("D:\Vault\Designs\temp-v") 'connection.WorkingFoldersManager.GetWorkingFolder(oFileIteration)

                oSettings.AddEntityToAcquire(oFileIteration)

                oSettings.LocalPath = New VDF.Currency.FolderPathAbsolute("D:\Vault\Designs\temp-v") 'connection.WorkingFoldersManager.GetWorkingFolder(oFileIteration)
                connection.FileManager.AcquireFiles(oSettings)


            End If

<p>I’ve been waiting for this for almost 9 years, and it’s finally here.&#0160; Vault has a good splash screen!</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong.&#0160; The old splash screens were not <em>bad</em>, they just didn’t fit well with the product.&#0160; Commonly the Vault screens would be very CAD related.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2013/SplashScreen/VaultPro2013.png" /></p>
<p>The above image would look perfect on AutoCAD or Inventor, but it just doesn’t fit Vault.&#0160; It’s not a bad image, but it doesn’t describe what the product is about.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #666666;" />
<p>Some of the early releases of Vault used “guys standing around a table” imagery.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2013/SplashScreen/Vault2008.jpg" /></p>
<p>This is better, but it doesn’t quite hit the mark.&#0160; Notice the lack of computers or anything hi-tech.&#0160; Some of the images even featured people staring at blueprints.&#0160; Although there is a collaboration aspect to Vault, it’s not really meant to simulate face-to-face meetings like what is being shown.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #666666;" />
<p>Vault is really about connecting and organizing CAD data, which brings us to the Vault 2014 splash screen.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2013/SplashScreen/VaultPro2014.png" /></p>
<p>Ahh, look at it.&#0160; A thing of beauty.&#0160; It has a nice hi-tech vibe to it and is pleasing to the eye.&#0160; So what do the interconnected balls represent?&#0160; The vault client and server components?&#0160; CAD files?&#0160; People?&#0160; Data management systems?&#0160; The answer is <strong>all of the above</strong>.&#0160; Vault does all of those things, and those things are a fitting description of Vault.&#0160; </p>
<p>Vault is a hard product to describe, so it doesn’t surprise me that it took so long to get it right.&#0160; I’m just glad it happened.&#0160; As a programmer, I usually don’t care about things like branding, but it looks like some real effort was put in to understand the products.&#0160; I’m not just talking about Vault either.&#0160; All the new Autodesk product releases are accompanied by amazing imagery.</p>

<p>The VDF will feel a lot different than the rest of the Vault API.&#0160; It’s almost as if it was built by a completely different team.&#0160; The reason is because it was built by a completely different team.&#0160; There are other reasons too.&#0160; Working with UI components is different than working with server calls.&#0160; Also, the VDF is able to follow a more object oriented approach than the web service layer.</p>
<p>But I&#39;m getting ahead of myself.&#0160; This post is about getting to know the VDF.&#0160; No talk of commitment or marriage or anything.&#0160; It&#39;s just a nice casual tour of the major components.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #ff5a00;" />
<p><strong>The DLLs</strong></p>
<p>There are 4 DLLs that make up the VDF.&#0160; They are the ones that start with Autodesk.DataManagement.</p>
<p><strong>Autodesk.DataManagement.Client.Framework.dll</strong> - This contains components that are not Vault-specific and do not contain UI.&#0160; Features include logging and error parsing.</p>
<p><strong>Autodesk.DataManagement.Client.Framework.Forms.dll</strong> - This contains UI components that are not Vault-specific.&#0160; Features include an error dialog and progress dialog.</p>
<p><strong>Autodesk.DataManagement.Client.Framework.Vault.dll</strong> - This contains Vault utilities but no UI.&#0160; Features include Connection management, download/upload workflows, working folder information, and Entity objects.</p>
<p><strong>Autodesk.DataManagement.Client.Framework.Vault.Forms.dll</strong> - This contains Vault UI.&#0160; Features include the login dialog, browse control, and checkout dialog.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #ff5a00;" />
<p><strong>Entry Points</strong></p>
<p>Each DLL has a <strong>Library</strong> object which contains a set of static methods.&#0160; The methods themselves are dependent on the feature set of the DLL.&#0160; The other major entry point is the <strong>Connection</strong> object, which has a set of managers.&#0160; Each manager contains methods for invoking high level workflows.&#0160; There is some overlap between VDF managers and web service managers.&#0160; For example, you can add a category through Connection.CategoryManager.AddCategory or Connection.WebServiceManager.CategoryService.AddCategory.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #ff5a00;" />
<p><strong>Currency and Services</strong></p>
<p>The VDF has its own set of <strong>currency</strong> objects.&#0160; These are basic objects used only for structured data.&#0160; Objects that perform actions are referred to as <strong>services</strong> (aka. <strong>managers</strong>).&#0160; VDF currency is similar to the Web Service currency, but there is usually more information in the VDF currency.&#0160; For example, the VDF’s FileIteration object has object references to the parent Folder and Category object reference.&#0160; The web service equivalent, File, has only ID references to parent Folder and Category.</p>
<p>You will frequently have to convert between the VDF and web service currency.&#0160; You can construct a VDF object from a web service object.&#0160; You can also cast down from VDF to web service object.&#0160; So it’s not too bad, but you still have to keep track of the different sets of currency.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #ff5a00;" />
<p><strong>Settings and Results</strong></p>
<p>The VDF supports many complex workflows, which may have multiple configuration options.&#0160; Instead of having functions with 20+ inputs, the VDF uses a <strong>settings</strong> object instead.&#0160; If you want the default behavior, you can just new up a settings object and pass it in to the workflow or UI.&#0160; Alter the settings object if you want non-default behavior.</p>
<p>The results of a workflow can be just as complex as the inputs, which is where the <strong>results</strong> object comes in.&#0160; If something goes wrong, don’t assume you will get an exception.&#0160; In many cases, you need to check the results object to see if there were failures or not.&#0160; Also, when UI is involved, you can’t assume that the user did what they were supposed to do.</p>

<li>Visual Studio 2010 has problems editing a XAML file with a WindowsFormsHost control.&#0160; I don’t know about Visual Studio 2012.</li>
<li>The XAML files and Settings.xml need to be distributed to all clients in order for them to see the custom UI.&#0160; This issue will be addressed in the next release of Project Thunderdome.</li>

Sorry, no.  Links only work with Entities, which are either Files, Folders, Items, Change Orders or Custom Objects.  Reports are not entities and cannot be linked to.

Also, you currently cannot generate a report from custom object data.

Hi Doug

I've just managed to create a report from the Custom Object data.

It only works if a search is done on the custom object. I'm guessing it them grabs all properties from the form.

If I try to generate a report directly on the custom object, it doesn't populate.

I'm not much of a XAML expert either.

The way I got it to work was to first add the ScrollViewer control.  Next, I switched to the XAML view and put the <Grid> XML inside the <ScrollViewer> tag. 
There may also be a way to do the same thing through the UI view by cutting and pasting.

Either way, make a copy of the XAML file before you do anything.

Hi Doug

I've found the data from vault populates in a drop down list for a combo box automatically if there is a list setup in vault.

I do have a problem though. It seems that it only selects the list items added in vault. I have selected IsEditable in the xaml combo box?

When inputting the data manually in the deco form it doesnt update.

Any help would be great.

Thanks
Paul

Sorry, I don't think I programmed that in.  One workaround is to use a textbox.  That way you can see and set the value, but you can't select from a list.
I'll put this on the wishlist.

Hi Doug,

I installed and created my first UI. I basically recreated the Tasks you showed in your 2013 video. I am having a problem linking my UI to the custom object.

when I go into Deco, configure menu, I add the name of the xaml file. Restart Vault Pro 2014, and then the xaml files do not get loaded. If I go back to the Configure menu, I'm still seeing default instead of the xaml name I added.

Any idea why I cannot add my UIs?

Regards,
dominic.

Go to C:\ProgramData\Autodesk\Vault 2014\Extensions\DECO and make sure there is full edit rights on Settings.xml.  That's where the configuration gets set.

If there is no Settings.xml file create it as a blank text file and make sure there is full edit rights.  

Now when you make changes and click OK in the Configuration dialog, that XML file should update.

There are similarities between DECO and Data Standard.  If it turns out that Data Standard can do the same thing as DECO, then I will retire DECO.
But if Data Standard can't provide the same functionality, then I'll put out a DECO 2015.

Ok thanks.

DECO has been a great tool for us. I have managed to create a number of custom objects. One to note is our non conformance register.

Please keep me informed.

Appreciate your efforts with this excellent attachment.

Thanks Doug.

Hi Doug, 
i`m often reading your blog although i`m not a programmer.
So last time i found your deco and i must say i is fantasitc. 
Now here is my question. Autodesk offers for subscription customers the vault data standards. 
What is the difference between your deco and the vds. And what is better to learn or to handle for a non programmer

greets from germany

Jörg

For Vault 2014, DECO is your best option I think.

However in Vault 2015, Data Standard has support for custom objects.  So I'm thinking that it can replace DECO moving forward.  I still have to investigate further before I decide.  Either way, I'll be blogging about it soon.

<p>The Vault 2014 SDK has some nice goodies for the development community.&#0160; Of course there are also changes that you need to make when upgrading your old code.&#0160; I’ll be going into each of these topics in more detail.&#0160; For now, here is a quick overview of what’s new.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #ff0000;" />
<p><strong>The VDF</strong></p>
<p>We came up with a set of tools so cool, we had to come up with a new acronym.&#0160; The Vault Development Framework (VDF) is a set of client-side libraries to support higher level operations and workflows.&#0160; It’s basically there so that you can do more with less code.</p>
<p>Here is a brief look at the architecture.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2013/WhatsNew2014/VDFdiagram.png" /></p>
<p>The VDF doesn’t provide complete feature coverage, so there are still many cases where you need to make web service calls.&#0160; If you are updating your code from a previous release, your web service calls can stay in place for the most part.</p>
<p>There are some <a href="http://wikihelp.autodesk.com/Vault/enu/Help/Help/0378-Develope378/0379-Vault_De379">VDF pages</a> on the Vault Wiki.&#0160; I’ll be covering the same content on my blog in the upcoming weeks.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #ff0000;" />
<p><strong>Filestore Server</strong></p>
<p>The web services have shifted around to incorporate the concept of a <strong>filestore</strong> <strong>server</strong>.&#0160; For many years now, the top tier Vault products have allowed for the filestore and database to be on separate servers.&#0160; This is a good feature, but the API wasn’t reflecting the architecture.&#0160; All API calls used to go through the server with the filestore on it.&#0160; It’s not a very good approach since a second hop would be needed for database data.</p>
<p>In Vault 2014, the API has been re-designed so that database-related calls go straight to the database server and file-related calls go straight to the file store.&#0160; The WebService manager takes care of most of this for you, but there are some changes that will impact your code...</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2013/WhatsNew2014/FilestoreService.png" /></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #ff0000;" />
<p><strong>Uploading and Downloading</strong></p>
<p>Uploading and Downloading requires both database and filestore data, so those operations can no longer be done in a single call.&#0160; The good news is that the VDF wraps the extra complexity.&#0160; I suggest you use Connection.FileManager.<strong>AcquireFiles</strong> for download and check out.&#0160; The FileManager also has <strong>AddFile</strong> and <strong>CheckinFile</strong> for the upload-related tasks.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #ff0000;" />
<p><strong>API Compatibility</strong></p>
<p>Vault 2014 continues with the web service API compatibility feature from the last release.&#0160; This time around, Vault supports 2 releases back, which means Vault 2012 and Vault 2013 clients will still be able to talk to a Vault 2014 server.&#0160; </p>
<p>Just like before, the compatibility feature only applies to the web service layer.&#0160; All other API features are version-specific.</p>
<p>Vault 2014 will be the last release that supports the 2012 web services.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #ff0000;" />
<p><strong>.vcet.config Syntax</strong></p>
<p>The XML syntax has changed for the .vcet.config files.&#0160; The new format is more flexible and allows for new extension types.&#0160; The easiest thing to do is copy-paste from the Getting Started section of the SDK documentation.&#0160; If you want to see the full spec, it’s in the Knowledgebase section of the SDK documentation.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #ff0000;" />
<p><strong>Vault Explorer and Job Processor Extensions</strong></p>
<p>The VaultContext class has been removed.&#0160; Instead your extension will be given a fully working Connection object.&#0160; Things are much cleaner this way since you don’t have to construct your own WebServiceManager.&#0160; It also fixes a couple of other issues, such as error 300.</p>
<p>The interface for Vault Explorer extensions has been renamed from IExtension to <strong>IExplorerExtension</strong>.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #ff0000;" />
<p><strong>Persistent IDs</strong></p>
<p>In the past, there was never a reliable way to reference a File from outside Vault.&#0160; File names can change, so that’s not good.&#0160; File ID and MasterId are database keys, so it’s not a good idea to use those.&#0160; In Vault 2014, we now support persistent IDs, which are guaranteed to never change.&#0160; The feature applies to Files, Folders, Items, Change Orders, and Custom Entities.</p>
<p>The relevant functions are <strong>GetPersistentIds</strong> and <strong>ResolvePersistentIds</strong> in the KnowledgeVaultService. </p>

Will persistent IDs now open the door for categorisation on check in based on folder path?

Sorry, no.  Persistent IDs is a completely independent feature.  It's not related to properties or categories.  So it will not help in creating category rules.

If I check out (not download) the file using acquirefiles how do I check it in as CheckinFile requires a path to the local file, but I didn't download it.

If you acquire to the default location, it will put the files on disk according to your Working Folder settings.

I believe the function you want is Connection.WorkingFolderManager.GetPathOfFileInWorkingFolder

When I have a WebServiceExtension and I need to checkout a file, set the value of a user defined attribute and checkin the file, how can I get a Connection or FileManager object to be able to acquire the file and do the work.

Currently, I'm trying to achieve that using DocumentService.CheckoutFile + DocumentService.CheckinUploadedFile but I have all kind of error at the checkin step.

Hey, I've gotta say your videos are awesome.  I've been .net programming for a couple years now, and I'm new to Vault programming as well.  However, I tried this and when I debug through VS2010 it works fine, but on it's own, I get the following warning:  "AutoCAD(1.0.0.0) is not compatible with the Data Management Server found on 'our vault name'"  Please help!

That message usually means a mismatch between the client and server versions.  Are you trying to connect to a Vault 2013 server?  

You may also see this if you are using a Beta SDK or a Vault Beta server.

Nevermind, found the issue.  Apparently AutoCAD 2013 and Vault 2014 don't like to talk to each other.  Performed a "manual" upgrade let's say, and it worked like a charm.  Got a crap ton of errors in AutoCAD but the program worked.  We're going to be updating to AutoCAD 2014 within the next couple of days!

Thanks anyway!

I apologize, the webpage just now updated to show you're reply Doug.  Yes that was the issue, but on a CAD to Vault mismatch instead.

<p>The Package Service is harder to describe than the rest of the Vault web services.&#0160; It was designed with one thing in mind, but ended up doing something else.&#0160; As a result, there are some artifacts left around that make it confusing to work with.&#0160; The main use nowadays is to import and export BOM data between the Item service and a file.&#0160; But there is still some active legacy behavior that you might find useful.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #5acb04;" />
<p><strong>File Import/Export:</strong></p>
<p>The Package Service implements the Import and Export commands for Item BOM data.&#0160; You can find sample code in the ItemEditor example in the SDK.</p>
<p>The biggest confusion with import/export API is that the Package Service has its own BOM objects, which act as an intermediate between the Item Service BOM and the imported/exported file.&#0160; Another point of confusion is the fact that the words &quot;import&quot; and &quot;export&quot; don&#39;t show up in any of the API functions. &#0160; </p>
<p>For example, to export, you call PackageService.GetItemsAndBOMsFromItemIds() to convert the Item BOM to the Package BOM.&#0160; Next you call PackageService.DownloadPackage() to convert the Package BOM into a file.</p>
<p>Import works pretty much the same way but in reverse.&#0160; The major difference is that the Package BOM has can detect conflicts in the import.&#0160; For example, if you try to import revision A of an item but Vault has the same item at revision B, that&#39;s a conflict.&#0160; The Package BOM allows you to see, and sometimes fix, conflicts like these before the Item BOM gets updated.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #5acb04;" />
<p><strong>Legacy Behavior:</strong></p>
<p>The original intent of the Package service was to be an integration point between Vault and ERP Systems.&#0160; The original name for the service was the ERPService and you can still see ERP used in a few class names.&#0160; Out of the box, Vault supported compatibility to Microsoft Great Plains.&#0160; There was an Axapta integration too, but I think it required Autodesk Consulting.&#0160; Both integrations consisted of Vault importing/exporting data to a Microsoft Message Queue (MSMQ). </p>
<p>The intent was to support more integrations and maybe even have a pluggable interface.&#0160; But once the Job Server feature was developed, it became the main focus for integrations.&#0160; I wouldn’t go as far to say that the Package Service is gathering dust, but I don’t expect any other systems to be added to the Package Service.&#0160; You can basically import/export to an MSMQ or a file (which is labeled as “other” in the UI).&#0160; As far as I know, the MSMQ features still work, so you can use it as an alternative to Vault job queue.</p>

<p>Vault 2014 is out but only the Basic version.&#0160; I’m waiting until Vault Professional 2014 is released before I dive into the technical details of the API.&#0160; Stay tuned... or whatever the 21st century equivalent is.</p>
<p>This upcoming year, I will try a new format for my videos.&#0160; Currently most of the content is contained is a <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2012/02/6-hours-of-video-on-the-vault-api.html">6-hour block of videos</a>, which I realize is probably intimidating to some people.&#0160; The new format will favor more videos with a smaller size.&#0160; I’m hoping for around 10 minutes in length.&#0160; Each video will cover only one topic to make it more bite size.</p>
<p>I’m officially on the PLM 360 team.&#0160; In fact, I’ve been on the team since the new year.&#0160; But don’t worry, Vault API Expert isn&#39;t a title I will be parting with anytime soon. I’ll still be providing plenty of Vault content on this blog and in the development community.&#0160; You will also see a few others from the Vault team contributing to things like API support and discussion groups.</p>
<p>As to what I’m working on in PLM 360, I’ll leave it to your speculation.&#0160; As you probably know, I can’t talk about things that haven’t been released yet.</p>

<p>Update:&#0160; The survey is closed.&#0160; <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2013/03/sacred-tome-of-vault-knowledge-update.html" target="_self">Go here for <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2013/03/sacred-tome-of-vault-knowledge-update.html" target="_self">the results</a></a></p>
<p>I love hearing about all the technical Vault information that people create.&#0160; It’s sort of a hobby of mine.&#0160; There is some pretty good stuff out there.&#0160; Such as <a href="http://cadtoolbox.com/2012/11/13/azure/" target="_blank">how to set up Vault on a cloud server</a> and <a href="http://communities.autodesk.com/cis/resources/osnovy-programmirovaniya-autodesk-vault" target="_blank">a Russian class on Vault API programming</a>.&#0160; It’s all good.</p>
<p>So I thought I would compile a list of these resources - these sacred tomes of technical Vault knowledge, gathered from the farthest reaches of the internet.&#0160; If you have created or know about any of these resources, please tell me about them using this <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1UeeNAqlzb8N7jLxKoUwPPnzh8MOK2hRCEnxpq_KrWWk/viewform" target="_blank">survey link</a>.&#0160; Feel to submit multiple times.</p>
<p>The only requirements are:</p>
<ul>
<li>It has to be Vault related and useful. </li>
<li>It can’t be created by Autodesk. </li>
</ul>
<p>I’ll compile the results into an article later on this month.</p>

<p>A while back, I wrote <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2010/02/setting-file-attributes-on-download.html" target="_blank">an article</a> on the extra steps you need to do on download in order to avoid the “edited out of turn” status <img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2010/Out_of_turn.png" />.&#0160; Unfortunately, I neglected to provide the extra steps you need to do on upload.</p>
<p>When adding or checking in a file from the working folder, you should set the file to read-only.&#0160; This makes the file less likely to get updated by accident.&#0160; It also insures the correct file status in Vault Explorer.&#0160; </p>
<p>You should also set the create date on the local file so that it matches the CreateDate value from the File object returned from Vault.&#0160; This part is a bit confusing because File.CreateDate is the datetime that the version was created (aka. the check-in time).&#0160; So your file on disk will have a create date larger than the last modified date.</p>
<p>Those are the two basic things to set: read-only and create date.&#0160; They are same two steps are used for download.&#0160; Here is some example code:</p>

<p>If you are uploading from a location other than the working folder, you don’t need to worry about these steps.&#0160; The Vault status will be empty since it won’t find a match on the local file system.&#0160; If you are checking in and keeping the file checked out, you can also ignore these steps.&#0160; </p>

<p>I decided to fulfill <a href="http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/Autodesk-Vault-IdeaStation/Add-Lifecycle-Event-Editor-to-the-administrator-tools/idi-p/3740578" target="_blank">my own request</a> for this month.&#0160; I didn’t have much time to spend writing a new app, so I decided to grab Lifecycle Event Editor code from the EXE and tweak it to run inside Vault Explorer.</p>
<p>The plug-in itself has the exact same feature set as the exe.&#0160; But if you are not familiar with it, here is a quick run down.&#0160; You can use the Lifecycle Event Editor to tell the server to fire jobs when objects move through specific lifecycle states.&#0160; For example, you want a job of type “Dougpunch” to be created every time a file goes from For Review to Released, you might set something up like this.&#0160; </p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2013/LifecycleEventEditor/Screenshot.png" /></p>
<p>If you commit the changes then look at the Job Queue... you won’t see anything.&#0160; The Lifecycle Event Editor does not actually put any jobs on the queue, it just lets you configure the server settings.&#0160; The “Dougpunch” jobs show up when you move files from For Review to Released.&#0160; </p>
<p>Of course, if you try this out in your Vault nothing interesting will happen.&#0160; It will just result in a bunch of Dougpunch jobs on the queue that sit there until deleted.&#0160; There is nothing that is set up to handle Dougpunch jobs.&#0160; At least I hope there is not.&#0160; </p>
<p>The <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2010/03/lifecycle-event-jobs.html" target="_blank">lifecycle event feature</a> is useful for when you define your own job types through the API.&#0160; There are also some utilities, such as <a href="http://wikihelp.autodesk.com/Vault/enu/Help/Help/0097-Administ97/0205-Project_205" target="_blank">Project Sync</a>, which hook into this framework.</p>

EXCERPT:
I decided to fulfill my own request for this month.  I didn’t have much time to spend writing a new app, so I decided to grab Lifecycle Event Editor code from the EXE and tweak it to run inside Vault Explorer.

The plug-in itself has the exact same feature set as the exe.  But if you are not familiar with it, here is a quick run down.  You can use the Lifecycle Event Editor to tell the server to fire jobs when objects move through specific lifecycle states....

I appreciate this.  It's simple in terms of the difference in accessing the exe vs inside vault, but since I'm usually already in vault it will be nice to just load it from there.

On a side note, when I read first the post I read it as dogpunch and I'm like why on earth!  Then I re-read it the correct way and laughed out loud!

Hello, is this compatible with 2014? I need to add job "Create PDF" to lifecycle with plugin from cool orange, but i see there that Lifecycle Event Editor is mostly for 2013 versions.

Sorry, it's not compatible with 2014.
The workaround is to go to the SDK folder under your client install location.  Install the SDK, then go to the Util folder under the SDK's install location.  There you will find an EXE version of the Lifecycle Event Editor.

Hi Doug,
I have some questions about jobs type
what is the file extension ?
Where I must save my file (my procedure)
where must I declare my procedure (file.config .xml ... ? )

<p>Job Processor is constantly logging in and out of Vault.&#0160; So plugging-in to that app is different than with Vault Explorer, where you assume that the user is mostly staying logged in as a single user.&#0160; Job Processor, on the other hand, may have zero, one or two simultaneous log-ins at any given time.</p>
<p>It’s probably best if I just go over Job Processors timeline:</p>
<ol>
<li>Job Processor wakes up. </li>
<li>Job Processor logs in to the server, but not to a specific Vault.&#0160; This type of log in has limited functionality and does <strong>not</strong> consume a license. </li>
<li>IJobHandler.OnJobProcessorWake is called. </li>
<li>Job Processor checks the Job queue. </li>
<li>For each job:      <ol>
<li>Job Processor logs in to a Vault. This part consumes the license. </li>
<li>Job Processor sends the job off to the corresponding handler. (IJobHandler.Execute) </li>
<li>Job Processor logs out of Vault, which frees the license. </li>
</ol>   </li>
<li>Job processor logs out of the server. </li>
<li>IJobHandler.OnJobProcessorSleep is called. </li>
<li>Job processor goes to sleep. </li>
<li>Go back to step 1 after X number of minutes. </li>
</ol>  
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #ff5a00;" />
<p>So yes, at times Job Processor is logged in twice.&#0160; Although the same username and password are used, the contexts are different.&#0160; For all intents and purposes, they are completely separate log-ins.&#0160; Each job gets its own log-in, so your Execute handler should not be remembering anything about the context.&#0160; If your plug-in wants to do any useful Vault operations during the Wake or Sleep events, it will have to have its own set of credentials (see <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2012/05/q-tools-and-watch-folder-2013.html">Watch Folder 2013</a>).</p>
<p>Here are some other random facts:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can query the job queue without being logged into a specific Vault.&#0160; However, adding a job to the queue requires you to be logged in to a Vault. </li>
<li>Speaking of Watch Folder, I hooked it up to our internal Vault at Autodesk.&#0160; Every day I get a report of what’s going on in the Vault, and it’s been running solid for the past 8 months. </li>
<li>IExplorerUtil had a bug that was caused by it remembering the login context.&#0160; If you are using IExplorerUtil tool inside Job Processer 2013, make sure to grab <a href="http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/ps/dl/item?siteID=123112&amp;id=19844149&amp;linkID=9261341" target="_blank">the hotfix</a>. <br />Note: The hotfix has been rolled up into <a href="http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/ps/dl/item?siteID=123112&amp;id=21017345&amp;linkID=9261341" target="_blank">Service Pack 1</a>.</li>

It looks like Service Pack 1 contains the API hotfix.  So if you have SP1 already, you are good.  I'll update the blog article.

<p>The Vault API is sometimes redundant, and it can also repeat itself.&#0160; One place were this is painfully obvious is with file name generation.&#0160; If you want to generate a file name, there are two completely separate mechanisms to choose from.&#0160; Each has its own set of API functions with their own sets of pros and cons.&#0160; You have to choose which is best for your needs.&#0160; There is no one mechanism to rule them all.</p>
<p>To make matters worse, they have similar names.&#0160; Once engine is for file <strong>naming</strong> schemes and the other is for file <strong>numbering</strong> schemes.&#0160; If you are not paying attention, you may mistake one word for the other.&#0160; It’s annoying, I know.&#0160; It’s like reading a three volume fantasy epic where one villain is called Sauron and the other is called Saruman.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #ff5a00;" />
<p><strong>File Naming Schemes:</strong></p>
<p>This is a pretty basic mechanism, so it&#39;s good if you want something quick and simple.&#0160; It consists of an auto-increment number with a string prefix and suffix.&#0160; I believe that Copy Design uses this feature.</p>
<p>One nice feature is that you can “rollback” a name if you decide not to use it.&#0160;&#0160; For example, the user hits Cancel on your dialog.&#0160; </p>
<p>Functions for generating names:</p>
<ul>
<li>GetAllFileNamingSchemes </li>
<li>ReserveFileNamingDescriptions </li>
<li>RollbackFileNamingDescriptions </li>
</ul>
<p>Admin functions:</p>
<ul>
<li>AddFileNamingScheme </li>
<li>DeleteFileNamingScheme </li>
<li>SetDefaultFileNamingScheme </li>
<li>UpdateFileNamingScheme </li>
</ul>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #ff5a00;" />
<p><strong>File Numbering Schemes:</strong></p>
<p>This is much more complex.&#0160; You chain together different field types to create your naming pattern.&#0160; It’s more powerful, but it’s also more difficult to work with.&#0160; Items and Change Orders use this engine too.&#0160; </p>
<p>Unfortunately, there is no way to “rollback” a number.&#0160; Once it’s generated, it’s reserved forever.</p>
<p>Functions for generating names:</p>
<ul>
<li>GenerateFileNumber </li>
<li>GenerateFileNumbers </li>
<li>GetNumberingSchemesByType </li>
</ul>
<p>Admin functions:</p>
<ul>
<li>ActivateNumberingSchemes </li>
<li>DeactivateNumberingSchemes </li>
<li>DeleteNumberingScheme </li>
<li>DeleteNumberingSchemeUnconditional </li>
<li>SetDefaultNumberingScheme </li>
<li>UpdateNumberingScheme </li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some screenshots from Vault Explorer that illustrate how fields are hooked together to form the numbering scheme.</p>

Hello, in Vault 2015 R2,
If you have a custom numbering scheme(Fixed Text, Free text and Pre-defined list) where one of his Fields is a Pre-defined list, is possible to get the "description" from each "item" from this pre-defined list?

Pre-defined list:
Code - Description
X    - Stand
B    - Blue
G    - Green

I will get the Description of each item of the list.
Is it possible with C#?

Thank you!

DocumentService.GetNumberingSchemesByType() returns an array of NumSchm objects.  Each one of those objects has a full description of a numbering scheme, including the fields involved.

Keep in mind that NumSchmField can be subclassed into objects that are specialized to each field type (FreeTxtField, AutogenField, and so on).

<p>The final entry in my Vault Integration Pattern series will focus on using Vault’s job queue for transferring data.&#0160; Like I said before, there are more integrations patterns out there, I’m just focusing on the ones that I have used first-hand.</p>
<p>I used this technique for the short-lived integration between Vault and PLM.&#0160; Let me just get this out of the way upfront: The integration pattern I used had nothing to do with the app being discontinued.&#0160; The long term vision changed, and the integration was caught in the middle.&#0160; From a technical standpoint, the integration pattern is sound.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #5acb04;" />
<p>Since PLM is in the cloud and Vault is behind a firewall, there was no easy way for PLM to have a direct view into Vault.&#0160; Data would have to be copied to PLM.&#0160; I also wanted a very reliable mechanism for data transfer, so doing it real-time in the Vault clients was not a good fit.</p>
<p>I went with the Vault job queue because it provides a guaranteed mechanism for the data transfer.&#0160; If it’s on the queue, I can rely on it staying on the queue until it gets properly dealt with.&#0160; If there is an error, it’s logged in the form of an error job on the queue.&#0160; If something critical goes wrong, like a power outage, the job is still on the queue in the processing state.</p>
<p>The downside is that the queue is asynchronous.&#0160; Even if you <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2013/02/custom-jobs-without-job-processor.html" target="_blank">grab jobs directly off the queue</a> you are still relying on polling.&#0160; There is no way to instantly know when the job is queued.&#0160; The other major disadvantage is that it runs without any user interaction.&#0160; So you can’t prompt the user for information and you can’t rely on problems getting addressed immediately.</p>
<p>If you are replicating data this way, I highly suggest having some kind of re-sync button.&#0160; It’s great when developing and debugging.&#0160; It’s also doubles as a bulk-load command, which is usually a requirement for integrations like this.&#0160; Lastly, it’s a magic fix-all button for a bunch of difficult error cases, such as a user deleting data manually.&#0160; These re-sync buttons tend to be slow, but that’s OK because things are asynchronous.&#0160; Also, with the <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2011/07/job-queue-priority.html" target="_blank">job queue priority feature</a>, you can insure that the re-sync doesn’t interfere with everyday operations.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #5acb04;" />
<p>To summarize...</p>
<p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Guaranteed delivery</strong> - Jobs on the queue are guaranteed to stay there until something process them or the Vault admin removes them.</li>
<li><strong>Failure recovery</strong> - Failed jobs can be re-submitted.</li>
<li><strong>Background process</strong> - Doesn’t interfere or slow down normal operations. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Conflicts</strong> - The same data may get updated at the same time in two different systems.</li>
<li><strong>Asynchronous</strong> - You have to wait before you can see results.</li>
<li><strong>Duplicate data</strong> - The same data is now in two different systems.</li>

<p>I have a lot of apps on this site.&#0160; And several of them are quite good, if I do say so myself.&#0160; But there is always room for improvement.&#0160; I frequently get suggestions on how to make something better.&#0160; If I had an infinite amount of time, I would implement all these suggestions.&#0160; But I don’t have that kind of time.&#0160; So improvements either have to be postponed indefinitely or somebody else has to write them.</p>
<p>That brings me to the Open Source approach to software development.&#0160; Technically, my apps are already open source because I post the source code.&#0160; But when it comes to updates, there is no way for an outside party to contribute to the app.</p>
<p>Things like <a class="zem_slink" href="http://sourceforge.net" rel="homepage" target="_blank" title="SourceForge">SourceForge</a> have been suggested to me in the past, and it’s a good suggestion.&#0160; But a lot of details need to be worked out before I head down that path.&#0160; The main problem is that, as far as I know, Autodesk doesn’t have a good policy for this sort of thing.&#0160; I would need to work out the details with my bosses, product managers, legal department, etc.&#0160; The whole thing could get shot down at any point.</p>
<p>Of course, the whole effort would be for nothing I’m the only one contributing to it.&#0160; There is not much incentive for somebody to contribute on a free app.&#0160; It might be better to ignore open source and just focus on mechanisms that offer a monetary rewarded.&#0160; For example, I know that some consulting companies are modifying my apps for specific customer contracts.&#0160; I’m fine with that.&#0160; I’m also fine with somebody taking my app, adding features to it, putting it up on the <a href="http://apps.exchange.autodesk.com/VLTC/Home/Index" target="_blank">Vault app store</a>, and charging for it.</p>

<p>If you are building your own custom job, you do not have to plug-in to Job Processor if you don’t want to.&#0160; The job queue can be accessed through the Vault web services API, just like with files and folders.&#0160; </p>
<p>The <em>recommended</em> approach is to use Job Processor.&#0160; That approach is what you see in the SDK documentation and sample apps.&#0160; But the Job Processor can’t handle all the cases.&#0160; There are some times when you may want to just write your own service.&#0160; This article will help you identify those cases and provide some help writing the code.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #ff5a00;" />
<p>First let’s talk about what Job Processor does well.&#0160; It’s a single application than can handle multiple job types.&#0160; It has various job handlers loaded out-of-the box, and additional functionality can be plugged in.&#0160; For a Vault admin, this is good because everything can be managed from a single app.&#0160; If something goes wrong, there is only one place to look, one log file to check, and so on.&#0160; From the developer&#39;s point of view, Job Processor offers some nice features.&#0160; You don’t have to worry about Vault authentication, managing the job queue and logging.&#0160; None of these things are very hard, but it’s nice to have the app take care of them.</p>
<p>On the flip side, Job Processor does have some limitations.&#0160; First, it’s not a true Windows service.&#0160; A user has to log in, launch the app, and leave it running.&#0160; Job Processor handles jobs one at a time.&#0160; There is no parallel processing.&#0160; And you can only run a single process on a machine.&#0160; A common problem is that Job Processor gets bogged down with jobs that take a long time, like DWF generate jobs.&#0160; This prevents other types from running even if they take less time to run.&#0160; </p>
<p>If you are running in a multi-site environment, Job Processor can only process jobs from one site.&#0160; Vault requires that a job can only be handled by the site that queued it.&#0160; So if you have 5 sites queuing jobs, you would need 5 Job Processors running.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #ff5a00;" />
<p>By communicating directly with the job queue you can bypass these limitations and build exactly the app you want.&#0160; Working with the job queue is easy.&#0160; You just need to use the following functions from the JobService:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>ReserveNextJob</strong> - This grabs a job and reserves it to you so that nobody else works on it.&#0160; You pass in the job types you support and Vault passes back the “next” job based on the priority and the time it was queued. </li>
<li><strong>UpdateJobSuccess</strong> - This tells Vault that you are done with the job, and it can be removed from the queue. </li>
<li><strong>UpdateJobFailure</strong> - This tells Vault that something went wrong.&#0160; The job stays on the queue in the error state.&#0160; You can pass back information on what went wrong. </li>
<li><strong>UnReserveJobById</strong> - This function is used for cases where a job gets reserved but never updated.&#0160; For example, maybe the service crashed or there was a power outage.&#0160; </li>
</ul>
<p>If you want an example, have a look a <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2012/05/q-tools-and-watch-folder-2013.html">Q-Tools</a>.&#0160; It’s a Windows service that can interact with queues from multiple Vault sites.</p>

Hi Doug, 

Great information. But it seems that at least with Vault 2013 the Job gets automatically UnReserved after a period of time. This results in an error when the custom JobProcessor is trying to set the Job state. 

Is there a way to prevent this behavior?

Thanks in advance, 

Jaap

I'm not familiar with that behavior.  Is this with a custom job type or one of the default types?  It custom job types are being unreserved, I would consider that a bug.

Hi Doug,

Yes it is a custom job. But I found what is going on. It only happens when the Job Processor is also running. It unreserves all its own jobs. I worked around that by adding a suffix to the hostname as client name.

Greetings,

Jaap

<p>If you’ve looked at any of the source code for my apps, first, let me apologize.&#0160; I went for quantity over quality on those apps.&#0160; So I didn’t structure the code for people not named Doug Redmond.&#0160; Even if you are a professional programmer, I’m guessing you don’t want to spend hours of your time deciphering a bunch of uncommented C#.&#0160; It’s probably best if I explain some techniques in the more human-readable blog format.</p>
<p>For this article, I’d like to talk about a caching technique that I’ve found useful in some of my apps.&#0160; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_%28computing%29" target="_blank">Caching</a> is pretty much a necessity when working with Vault.&#0160; You are constantly running into cases where you have an ID and you need to look up the object.&#0160; For things like Categories, Property Definitions and Lifecycle States the objects are unlikely to change.&#0160; So the optimial thing to do is store them in memory to reduce the number of API calls.</p>
<p>I like to call my cache Cache.&#0160; It contains two main things: The WebServiceManager and collections of cached Vault data.</p>
<p>For the collections of cached data, I usually use <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazy_initialization" rel="wikipedia" target="_blank" title="Lazy initialization">lazy initialization</a>.&#0160; That way I don’t look up something if I don’t have to.&#0160; The first request for the data triggers the API call.&#0160; Any further requests for the data use the cache.</p>
<p>The data structure I use depends on how I want to use it.&#0160; Just because Vault returns an array doesn’t mean I have to store it that way in the cache.&#0160; Frequently I’ll store it as a dictionary using the ID or system name as the key.&#0160; The ToDictionary feature in LINQ is a nice little trick.</p>
<p>Example code from <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2012/07/deco-custom-ui-without-custom-code.html" target="_blank">DECO</a>:</p>

<p>My Cache object also contains a WebServiceManager.&#0160; First, the lazy initializers need to run API commands.&#0160; Second, I find it easier to manage.&#0160; If the manager and the cache were two separate things, that’s two things I have pass around all the time and keep track of in the code.&#0160; By putting the manager in the cache, I only have one object to track.&#0160; The objects work well together too.&#0160; For example, if you ever need to dispose your WebServiceManager, you will probably want to clear out your cache too.</p>
<p>There are some other cases where you will want to clear your cache.&#0160; Mainly, if the data you are caching gets updated.&#0160; In my <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2013/01/effective-permissions-2013.html" target="_blank">Effective Permissions</a> app, I cache all the all the user and group information.&#0160; But it’s reasonable that an admin might run Effective Permissions, update the user and group settings, then run Effective Permissions again.&#0160; So I need to clear my cache, but the Vault API doesn’t give me a way to know that users or groups were updated.&#0160; </p>
<p>My solution was to clear the cache whenever the Global Settings command is invoked.&#0160; Even though I don’t know for sure that anything changed, I clear the cache anyway, just to be safe.&#0160; This technique isn’t 100%.&#0160; It’s possible that another custom command updated the data, or another admin updated the data from their Vault client.&#0160; In the case of Effective Permissions, I didn&#39;t feel a 100% solution was needed.</p>

<p>Update:&#0160; The <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2013/10/effective-permissions-2014.html" target="_blank">2014 version</a> is now available.</p>
<p>I’m currently in an amazingly interesting DB training class.&#0160; So I decided to do some Vault app programming so that my heart wouldn&#39;t explode from all the excitement.&#0160; The result is Effective Permissions 2013.&#0160; It’s an update of my <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2010/04/effective-folder-permissions-20.html" target="_blank">Effective Folder Permissions 2.0</a>.&#0160; The ‘Folder’ part of the name has been dropped since it now does more than just folder permissions.&#0160; Files and custom objects can also be managed.</p>
<p>Check out the video:</p>
<iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/ol53Wch8rB4" width="420"></iframe>
<p>The main new addition is a view/edit window for object permissions.&#0160; You can now edit an Access Control List and see the effect before you commit the change.&#0160; It’s also smart enough to determine the source of the ACL and make the 
appropriate updates.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2013/EffectivePermissions/PermissionsWindow_scaled.png" /></p>
<p>All the old features are still there.&#0160; So you can still see the Administrators List, and you still have the Permissions Overview, which shows the user-based permissions for a set of folders.</p>

I’m currently in an amazingly interesting DB training class.  So I decided to do some Vault app programming so that my heart wouldn't explode from all the excitement.  The result is Effective Permissions 2013.  It’s an update of my Effective Folder Permissions 2.0.  The ‘Folder’ part of the name has been dropped since it now does more than just folder permissions.  Files and custom objects can also be managed.

Great to hear you "patronize back" the util development and it get new functionality!
It is the highly important util in extended Vault environments like our company has.
I have couple questions regarding it:
1. Was revoving radiobutton (groups/user) rewoved from Permissions overview deliberately? How to manage groups with it now?
2. Click on cell in Overview window now generates no the expected dialog for making changes? Was it made deliberate?

It looks like you are comparing my 2013 version with the 2012 version at <a href="http://vaultfolderpermis.codeplex.com/">http://vaultfolderpermis.codeplex.com/</a>

The 2013 version is not based on the 2012 version.

The version on codeplex was not written by me or anyone at Autodesk.  Since I work for Autodesk, I am very careful when using outside code.  Autodesk doesn't have a well defined "open-source" code policy.  So the safe approach was to just stick to my code base.

Yes, you are right as to how i compare it. 
I also should admit that function of managing groups/folder access through overview table is the most utilized function of the util for our company...

There is something I am missing in Effective Folder Permission, it only display "Users" is it possible to get it to display "user groups" ?

Is it something you will like work on?
I have discovered something more,  in the Effective Folder Permission,
if users is member of a group and the group has premission on folder,
the user is display as they have "no access".

It could be nice to have a feature displaying in grid user and groups members like
Folder Permission.

Thanks for the suggestions.  Unfortunately, I don't plan on adding features any time soon.  These apps are just side projects of mine, so I can't spent too much time on them.

The source code is posted, and other programmers are free to add their own functionality.

Thanks for letting me know.  My guess is that there are too many folders for the dialog to handle.

Unfortunately, I don't have much time right now to look into it.  If you have any more details, feel free to email them to me directly.

<p>Welcome to part 2 of my 3-part series on Vault integration patterns.&#0160; There are many more than 3 patterns, but I’m going to stick to ones that I’ve actually used on an app or product.&#0160; </p>
<p>Today’s pattern is the idea that Vault communicates with the other system, in real time, whenever things change.&#0160; I used this pattern for <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2011/09/vault-bluestreak.html">Vault ♥ Bluestreak</a>.&#0160; In that app, I hooked to events from Vault Explorer and Events.&#0160; This allowed the app to “listen” to what the user is doing and send out notifications to Bluestreak.&#0160; Bluestreak would then post on the notification on it’s Activity Stream, which is similar to a Facebook wall.</p>
<p>Maybe it will be clearer if you see the demo video (no audio):</p>
<iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/abF1CVQgdWU" width="420"></iframe>
<p>The general idea here is that the integration app listens to events and interacts with the other system as soon as the event comes in.&#0160; Vault doesn’t have server side events, so the app has to be client-side.&#0160; In this case, the communication is one way.&#0160; I’m sending alerts to Bluestreak, but I don’t need to get any sort of response.&#0160; So the code makes heavy use of Post events.&#0160; The communication with Bluestreak is done in another thread for performance reasons.</p>
<p>If you have a case where you need to read data from the other system, this pattern still works.&#0160; The only difference is that you would be using the GetRestrictions or Pre events.&#0160; Multi-threading probably won’t work here since you need to halt the Vault operation while waiting for the other system to respond.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #5acb04;" />
<p>Advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Operations occur in real time</strong> - No need to keep hitting the refresh button, like when working with the Job Processor. </li>
<li><strong>User Interaction</strong> - If you need input from the user, you can do it.&#0160; You can also pop up errors immediately if something goes wrong. </li>
</ul>
<p>Disadvantages:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Events are not guaranteed</strong> - Because the operations are client-side, they occur outside the database transaction.&#0160; This means that there is a chance that the event happens, but the Post event never fires.&#0160; For example, a file changes lifecycle state, and the power goes out right before the Post event fires.&#0160; In this case, the Post even is lost forever.&#0160; Along the same lines, a Pre event may fire, but the actual operation my never get a chance to run.&#0160; So if you need 100% guarantee on your data, this is not the pattern to use. </li>
<li><strong>Client side install</strong> - If you have 100 Vault users that need to integrate with the other system, you need to install the app on 100 machines.&#0160; If an app starts failing for a user, it may not be immediately obvious. </li>
</ul>

<p>Let’s start off with a quick quiz.&#0160; Look at the image and answer the following questions:    <br />Are the file and the folder in the same category?     <br />Are the file and the folder in the same lifecycle state?</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2013/ObjectTypes/Grid.png" /></p>
<p>Answers:&#0160; <strong>No</strong>, they are in different categories, and <strong>yes</strong>, they are in the same lifecycle state.</p>
<p>It can be a bit confusing when you have concepts that span multiple objects types.&#0160; Sometimes you can share behavior across different types and sometimes you can’t.&#0160; In this article, I’ll attempt to explain what the scope of each feature.</p>
<p>Custom entities make things more tricky.&#0160; In case you don’t know already, all custom entities are part of the same entity class (CUSTENT).&#0160; When you create your own custom entity definition, it’s actually a <strong>sub-type</strong> of CUSTENT.&#0160; So that adds another level of complexity when defining scope.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2012/CustomEntities/SubTypes.png" /></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #5acb04;" />
<p>Let me go down feature-by-feature and explain the scope...</p>
<p><strong>Categories</strong> - A category is specific to an entity class.&#0160; It cannot be shared across different entity classes.&#0160; So a File and a Folder can never have the same category.&#0160; You can give set the display names the same on a File and Folder categories, like in my quiz, but they are still different underlying objects.</p>
<p>Categories are applied at the entity class level.&#0160; So, CUSTENT categories can be used by any of the custom entity sub-types.&#0160; So it is possible for a Foo object and a Bar object to have the same category.</p>
<p><strong>Property Definitions</strong> - A property definition can span multiple entity classes.&#0160; If you go to the admin settings, you will see that it’s common for Files and Folders to share a property definition.&#0160; Categories can provide additional behavior, but it’s not required.&#0160; If a Property Definition is associated to the FILE entity class, then any file object can have that property, regardless of category.</p>
<p>If a property definition is associated to the CUSTENT entity class, then it’s available to all sub-types.&#0160; There is no way to have a property definition specifically for Foo objects.</p>
<p><strong>Searching</strong> - A search is specific to an entity class.&#0160; This is pretty obvious at the API level since the functions are named FindXBySearchConditions, where the X is the entity class. </p>
<p>For custom entities, a search will span all CUSTENT objects, regardless of sub-types.&#0160; So it’s possible for a single search to return both Foo and Bar objects.&#0160; Most of the time, you don’t want this, so you need to add a search condition that narrows the search to a specific sub-type.</p>
<p><strong>Lifecycle Definitions</strong> - Files, folders and custom entities all share the same lifecycle engine.&#0160; Any lifecycle definition can be used across these 3 entity types and any custom object sub-types.&#0160; The only restriction is that the entity must be in a category that is associated with the lifecycle definition.</p>
<p><strong>Revision Schemes</strong> - They work similar to lifecycle definitions.&#0160; You can share them across different entity classes, but the entity must be in a category that is associated with the lifecycle definition.</p>
<p><strong>Roles and Permissions</strong> - The role usually mentions the entity class directly, such as Item Editor (Level 1).&#0160; So it’s pretty clear that roles are specific to an entity class.&#0160; </p>
<p>For custom entities, a role applies to all custom entity sub types.&#0160; So somebody with Custom Object Editor (Level 1), can edit both “foo” and “bar” objects.&#0160; If you want the user to be able to edit “foo” but not “bar”, you need to give that user the edit role, then use ACL security to restrict edit on “bar” objects.</p>
<p><strong>Custom Commands</strong> - These can be bound to a specific entity type.&#0160; In the case of custom entities, they can be bound to specific to a sub-type.&#0160; A command can work with to different types/sub-types by binding the command to multiple command sites.&#0160; Another option is to specify null for the NavigationTypes property, which has the effect of making the command always available.</p>
<p><strong>Custom Tab Views</strong> - These are always bound to a specific entity type or custom entity sub-type.&#0160; You can’t share a file tab with an item tab or a “foo” tab with a “bar” tab.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #5acb04;" />
<p>Speaking of bar tabs, it’s payday and my shift is over.&#0160; I’ll leave you with this this handy chart, summarizing everything.</p>

<p>By far, the most common use of the Vault API is to provide some sort of integrations with something else.&#0160; Sure there are some good utilities up on the <a href="http://apps.exchange.autodesk.com/VLTC/Home/Index" target="_blank">App Store</a>, but they don’t represent the majority of the cases.&#0160; Consulting is where it’s at, and there are a surprising number of systems out there to connect Vault to.</p>
<p>Each integration is different, so there is no way for me to tell you everything you ever need to know.&#0160; However, there are certain patterns that emerge, and it’s the patterns that I will be focusing on.</p>
<p>The first pattern is the one I used when designing the <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2011/07/autodesk-vault-for-sharepoint-2010.html" target="_blank">SharePoint 2010 integration</a>.&#0160; <strong>One system provides a view of data in another system</strong>.&#0160; In this case, SharePoint 2010 provides a view Vault data.</p>
<p>If you do it right, the end user should not know (and not care) that the data is coming from an outside system.&#0160; The SP integration does this very well.&#0160; Here is a game you can play.&#0160; Look at the following video and try to figure out what is the SharePoint data and what is the Vault data.</p>
<iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/ekIvy94C538" width="420"></iframe>
<p>One cool thing about BCS, the SP feature I used for the integration, is that it doesn’t just provide a view of external data.&#0160; BCS allows you to <strong>link</strong> SharePoint data with external data.&#0160; This is a pretty useful feature for integrations like this.&#0160; If you can’t link the data between the two systems, then the integration loses a lot of value.&#0160; The end user may as well just use two separate applications.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #5acb04;" />
<p>I’ll end the article with some quick bullets on the advantages and disadvantages of this pattern.&#0160; If I left anything out, please let me know in the comments section.</p>
<p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>No duplication of data</strong> - Everything is just cleaner when data lives in one and only one place.&#0160; You don’t have to worry about stale data, and you don’t have to worry about conflicts </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Performance</strong> - Constantly pulling data from another source is time consuming.&#0160; No matter how much you optimize things, it will never be as fast as having the data in the same system.&#0160; For SharePoint, we found that the distance between the SP server and the Vault server was the biggest factor in how quick the Vault pages came up in SP. </li>
<li><strong>Network Dependency</strong> - If the network ever goes down between the two systems, the integration is effectively broken.&#0160; People who rely on the data will no longer be able to access it. </li>
</ul>

<p>This month&#39;s app is an update of Vault Query.&#0160; It’s a cute little program that reads Vault data at the API level and displays the results in a similar format to the Visual Studio debugger.&#0160; It’s good for things like figuring out what the system name is for the UDP you want to read.</p>
<p>New for 2013, you can export the results to an XML file.&#0160; A lot of times, I find it easier to sift through an XML file instead of dealing with a tree view.</p>

<p>I set up a bunch of operations out-of-the-box, but you can add your own.&#0160; You can either use the &quot;Add Actions&quot; command or edit the Operations.xml file.&#0160; In theory, any API call can be made into an operation.&#0160; However the UI is picky about what input types it supports.&#0160; You may need to edit Operations.xml for many cases.</p>

EXCERPT:
This month's app is an update of Vault Query.  It’s a cute little program that reads Vault data at the API level and displays the results in a similar format to the Visual Studio debugger.  It’s good for things like figuring out what the system name is for the UDP you want to read.

Thank you for great app, Doug!

If you allow, I'd like to offer some tricks about Vault 2014 compatability, while there is no new Vault Query version:
1. You can easy connect to Vault Server 2014 with Vault Query 2013.
2. You can play around with new Vault API, just updating following dll's with same ones from Vault 2014:
<ul>Autodesk.Connectivity.WebServices.dll
Autodesk.Connectivity.Extensibility.Framework.dll</ul>
You can find this files in "SDK/bin" folder.

<p>AU is now over, and I’m almost fully recovered.&#0160; My limp is barely noticeable and my right eye is mostly in focus.&#0160; It will take a few more weeks for the slot-machine ringing noises to fade away, but that’s to be expected.&#0160; This is a good time to go over Vault API related topics from AU. </p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p><strong>Vault wins at Apphack     <br /></strong>Autodesk Developer Network put on an event called <a href="http://promoshq.wildfireapp.com/website/6/contests/296215" target="_blank">Apphack</a>.&#0160; The idea is that people could submit their apps, and the public votes on which one should win.&#0160; I think there were around 20 entries.&#0160; The <a href="http://promoshq.wildfireapp.com/website/6/contests/296215/prize_giving" target="_blank">winning entry</a> was a Vault App!</p>
<p>Rob Oud from CAD &amp; Company submitted Vault Project Portfolio.&#0160; It’s a Vault Browser app for Windows 8 tablet.&#0160; I was able to see a quick demo between classes, and the app looks very cool.</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p><strong>My classes were not recorded, again      <br /></strong>Every year a rumor goes around that every class will be recorded, and every year it turns out to be a lie.&#0160; I don’t think I’ve ever had an AU lecture recorded.</p>
<p>Anyway, my two classes “Programming Integrations Between Autodesk Vault and Other Systems” and “Programming Custom Objects with the Autodesk Vault API” will be converted into blog posts over the next few months.&#0160; It’s probably for the best anyway.&#0160; You can’t Google for content within a video very well.</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p><strong>Process is critical     <br /></strong>I like to attend as many Vault classes as I can.&#0160; Mainly I just sit and listen.&#0160; One common theme this year was process.&#0160; If you don’t get your processes defined properly, your Vault deployment will be a failure.&#0160; That got me to thinking what I usually think about:&#0160; Can I write any apps for this?&#0160; </p>
<p>It’s a bit of a “chicken and the egg” problem.&#0160; How can I write a Vault app that helps with Vault deployment?&#0160; Any suggestions would be welcome.</p>

Congrats to the vault app for winning apphack!
If you have any pull with the apphack managers, you should see if maybe next year they can open it up to Inventor...

<p>Although my official job title is “Software Engineer,” my API knowledge makes me an honorary member of the tech support team.&#0160; More often than not, I read a problem and don’t have enough information to answer it properly.&#0160; This requires me to respond asking for more formation.&#0160; Usually one or two more back-and-forth sessions are needed before the question is finally answered.&#0160; This process is a wasteful, especially when different time zones are involved.&#0160; If you figure that each back-and-forth takes 24 hours, there is a definite benefit to reducing these round-trips.</p>
<p>So here is a list of things you can do to make the process more efficient.&#0160; The goal is to provide all the needed information upfront so that I don’t have to go back and ask you to elaborate in more detail.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #ff5a00;" />
<p><strong>DO... include the Vault product and version      <br /></strong>Is it Vault Basic?&#0160; Vault Professional?&#0160; Is is the 2013 version?&#0160; Each product has a different feature set and the API may change between release years.</p>
<p><strong>DON’T... use the phrase “It doesn’t work”      <br /></strong>That statement is way too vague.&#0160; You need to be more specific like “it crashes the program” or “it locks up and I have to restart the app” or “it times out” or “it returns error 303”</p>
<p><strong>DO... include the error code      <br /></strong>If the server returns an error, don’t just say “the server throws an error”.&#0160; Tell me what the error code is.&#0160; Don’t leave me in suspense.&#0160; I even have <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2011/11/getting-the-restriction-codes.html" target="_blank">some code snippets</a> you can use to extract the error and restriction codes (if any).</p>
<p><strong>DON’T... provide too much source code      <br /></strong>Sometimes people will post their entire project and expect me to debug it.&#0160; That’s not a good use of anybody’s time.&#0160; If you are going to include source code, it should be isolated to a single function at most.</p>
<p><strong>DO... isolate the line of code that fails      <br /></strong>If you are sending a block of code and are getting Exceptions, you need to indicate clearly which line is causing the breakage.</p>
<p><strong>DO... take screenshots      <br /></strong>It’s amazing how much information is conveyed in a screenshot.&#0160; Even if the Vault is in a different language, I can usually figure out what is going on based on the icons and dialogs.&#0160; Videos are great too.&#0160; If you find yourself taking 4 or more screenshots, it may be easier to just record a video.</p>
<p><strong>DO... use Exception.ToString()      <br /></strong>ToString is the best thing to happen to debugging since the print statement.&#0160; Don’t be afraid to use it and include the full stack trace in your problem report.&#0160; Even if you don’t understand it all, it may make sense to me since I have access to the Vault source code.</p>

<p>I want to explain a bit how bill of material data works in Vault.&#0160; It’s not very intuitive looking at the API.&#0160; I’ll also attempt to answer the question, “Why did they do it that way?” </p>
<p><strong>The Primary Workflow</strong></p>
<p>Let me know over the “primary workflow,” which I’m defining as the workflow most responsible for the architecture.&#0160; There are plenty of other valid workflows, but I’m not going to focus on them much here.</p>
<p>It’s best if I list out the sequence of events in the primary workflow:</p>
<ol>
<li>The CAD user adds a file to Vault. </li>
<li>The CAD plug-in uploads a BOM object along with the file.&#0160; I’ll refer to this object as the “file BOM”. </li>
<li>The “file BOM” object gets stored in the database and mostly stays dormant. </li>
<li>A Vault user selects the file and runs the “Assign Item” command. </li>
<li>Internally, the “file BOM” gets read and becomes the template for creating or updating Vault Items.&#0160; In other words, the “file BOM” fills out most the information in the Assign Item wizard. </li>
<li>When the Assign Item wizard is complete, the Item objects are created and hooked together to form an “Item BOM”.&#0160; The Item BOM is what user sees and interacts with in the Item Master. </li>
<li>The “file BOM” is still around in the database, but it goes back to being dormant.&#0160; It would only be used again if there is an update to the Item BOM or a need to re-create the Item BOM. </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Impact</strong></p>
<p>There are some interesting consequences as a result of this workflow.</p>
<ul>
<li>The item structure has nothing to do with the file assembly structure.&#0160; The file BOM is the only factor.</li>
<li>The file BOM is uploaded, even if the product is Vault Basic.&#0160; The idea is that the product may get upgraded to Vault Professional in the future.&#0160; If the upgrade never happens, the BOM data stays dormant forever. </li>
<li>The file BOM is not static data.&#0160; It may get altered by the server.&#0160; For example, data gets “filled in” during an Assign Item operation.&#0160; This way things are optimized if the Items ever need to be updated. </li>
<li>Results from GetBOMByFileId are not guaranteed to be the same, even when called on the same file version. See previous bullet.</li>
<li>GetBOMByFileId is not actually used anywhere in the process.&#0160; It’s an API-only feature intended for testing and troubleshooting purposes.&#0160; And yes, I’m well aware that many people are using this function beyond it’s intended scope. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>File BOM vs. Item BOM</strong></p>
<p>Here is a quick rundown of the two different BOM representations.</p>

Thanks for your post. First point is about the documentation. Your suggestion are not mentioned in the API documentation. 
In our case we have different process and we need the information from File BOM. This is because we are coping existing structure from vault and create new one. In that case we need file BOM to assign proper item together for files. Do you have some hint for this case?

Pawel J.

I don't have a good answer for this one.  For one reason or another, something always takes higher priority.  If we had infinite time and resources, this would be a feature.

Its a glaring omission in my opinion. As a result of having no lifecycle control, there's no ACL security on Items. The only way you can control which users can view Items is Via Roles. This means even read only users can see both Released & WIP items. I understand the Web Client only displays Released Items, but the Web Client sucks to navigate around & isn't customisable. 

The result is an unsecure Item environment. Rather odd if you ask me.

Hi Doug,

Regarding this, can we imagine to export the BOM of an assembly trough Vault API in order to send this to ERP (without using items)?

I have a customer who want to use file lifecycle but don't want to use item only for sending this to ERP (too complicate).

Thanks in advance.

If you want to use it that way, then you can do that.  But it's not the recommended approach, so there is extra risk on your part.

For example, it's possible for two drawings to reference the same part.  The Vault Item framework detects and handles these cases.  If you work with file BOMs directly, you are going to have a hard time detecting these cases.

Can I get FileBom in API omiting phantom?
I use function
Dim itfBom = wsm.DocumentService.GetBOMByFileId(fd.Id)
For Each bc As BOMComp In itfBom.CompArray
    if bc.BOMStruct <> BOMStructureEnum.Phantom Then
....
end if
but components with  BOMStructure = Phantom in Inventor returns Normal in Vault BOM API?

Dear Doug,
is it possible to use a custom object as a manufacturing order:
example i want to manufacture 3 times item1 and 7 times item2, and be able to track manufacturing in vault.

before plunging in programing:

is it possible to create a command in which i say i want 3 of this item1 and 7 item 2 for a certain project, after that it creates multiple custom objects (manufacturing order). Each custom object, represents a part to be manufactured, it has properties to track manufactured quantities (required BOM quantity, manufactured quantity, remaining quantity), and is it possible to create a tab for this object showing the drawing of this part from the item?

Thanks in advance

Dear Doug, 

i am new here, and just read the "Asking for Help - Do’s and Don’ts" section.

using vault professional 2013.
I do not require any code or debugging, only was asking about the feasibility of the idea, before exploring it in source code.

Thanks in advance

Yes, I think you can use Custom Objects to represent a manufacturing order.

You can make a custom command that creates Custom Objects based on the items that the user selects.  The Custom Object can either contain copied data from the items. Or you can link the Custom Object to the items. Or both.

You can create tabs for Custom Objects but the Vault API doesn't give you anything for displaying CAD data.  You would have to plug-in a viewer.

1. The CAD user adds a file to Vault.

2. The CAD plug-in uploads a BOM object along with the file.  I’ll refer to this object as the “file BOM”. 

I do not see this behavior in 2015 R2. If I check in a single file, the File BOM is not generated it seems until I assign an item to that file. Also, the BOMComp.UniqueId field is empty. I am using AutoCAD 2015 to check in these new files, is this expected behavior?

Thanks.

I think that vanilla AutoCAD does not supply BOM information because it doesn't understand the design enough.  You need AutoCAD Mechanical or AutoCAD Electrical if you want BOM information.

Vault still lets you run "Assign Item" on a file with no BOM.  In this case Vault creates a default BOM of just a single Item.

<p>I created vLogic to be a useful tool in a variety of situations.&#0160; It allows for customization without the overhead of a full-blown .NET DLL.&#0160; A lot of people think vLogic is a good idea, but I’m not aware of it being use in any real capacity.&#0160; As we all know, there is sometimes a big gap between “good idea” and “useful”.&#0160; So I though I would spend a few posts taking a crack at some real-word problems using vLogic.</p>
<p>This week’s post will be addressing an entry on the <a href="http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/Autodesk-Vault-IdeaStation/Assign-Category-per-Folder/idi-p/3609610" target="_blank">Vault Idea Exchange</a>.&#0160; A user wants to “<em>Have a category automatically assigned to a document, based on the folder it is &#39;imported&#39; to.&#0160; This would work only when there is a new document, or not another category, assigned to the document.”</em></p>
<p>Yes, I think I can do that with vLogic.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #ff5a00;" />
<p><strong>Requirements:</strong>&#0160; <br />Vault Workgroup/Collaboration/Professional 2013 and <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2012/03/vlogic-2013.html" target="_blank">vLogic 2013</a></p>
<p><strong>Steps:</strong>&#0160; </p>
<ol>
<li>Install vLogic if not installed already. </li>
<li>Download the <strong><a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/Files/vLogicScripts/Events/AddFilePost.SetToParentCategory.ps1" target="_blank">AddFilePost.SetToParentCategory.ps1</a></strong> script and put it in the vLogic’s “Event Scripts” folder.&#0160; The folder can be found at <strong>%ProgramData%\Autodesk\Vault 2013\Extensions\vLogic\Event Scripts</strong> with Windows Explorer. </li>
<li>If “Base” is not your default file category, open up the .ps1 script and edit the value for $BaseCategory. </li>
<li>Start or restart Vault Explorer. </li>
<li>Set up File and Folder categories with matching names for cases where you want the script to run.&#0160; This step is needed because categories can’t be shared across Files and Folders.</li>
<li>Set a folder category and add a file to it through Vault Explorer.&#0160; If the file goes into the default category, the vLogic script will assign it to the file category with the same name as the folder’s category. </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The script only works for files added through Vault Explorer. </li>
<li>This script can only run on clients with vLogic and the .ps1 file.&#0160; <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2012/08/project-thunderdome-2013.html" target="_blank">Project Thunderdome</a> can be used to deploy them both to multiple clients. </li>

I created vLogic to be a useful tool in a variety of situations.  It allows for customization without the overhead of a full-blown .NET DLL.  A lot of people think vLogic is a good idea, but I’m not aware of it being use in any real capacity.  As we all know, there is sometimes a big gap between “good idea” and “useful”.  So I though I would spend a few posts taking a crack at some real-word problems using vLogic.

Doug,

This step will cause an error to be thrown when exporting the vault configuration from the ADMS console:

"Set up File and Folder categories with matching names for cases where you want the script to run.  This step is needed because categories can’t be shared across Files and Folders."

Its a bug within the database I believe, once that is fixed then there will be nothing wrong with this approach. Bloody good work otherwise, Cheers.

Scott

Maybe you could change your code to look for the same names between the two, but the folder rule could use F_ as a prefix or something to maintain unique category naming?

The bug should be fixed of course, but this would be a semi-acceptable workaround.

I was able to export just fine in my Vault.  Is this an older defect?  Maybe it was fixed in Vault 2013.

Anyway, the nice thing about scripts is that it's easy to make changes.  To make your F_ change, just edit the PS1 file.  Find the part that says
<b>Where-Object {$_.Name -eq $parentFolder.Cat.CatName}</b>
And change it to
<b>Where-Object {$_.Name -eq "F_" + $parentFolder.Cat.CatName}</b>

Quite useful. Thanks.
Would be even more useful if couple options be added:
- grid column sorting
- result export to csv/xls
- find orphan Items
- find empty folders

The Vault Basic client doesn't support plug-ins.  So utilities like this are possible, but they would have to be written as a separate app.

Doug, I've just payed attention that subfolders in Extensions folder where your add-ins are stored are all with lock signs on them.
Think this is a reason why user that is not administrator got access error on attempt to start Vault Explorer (before Log in).
OS:Win7.

I' have forgotten to ask a question :)
The question is: Why all just_ones&zeroes apps (except Drawing Compare) don't allow users without admin rights to access corresponding Extensions folder and thus prevent Vault Explorer from start? Was it done deliberately?

No, it's not done deliberately, and I have not been hearing other people having this problem.

By default, users should be able to read from c:\programData.  My installers should not be setting any special permissions on the Extensions folders, so you would expect people to be able to read these extensions.

Drawing Compare uses the same installer framework that all my other apps use.  I don't see why it would behave differently.

<p>I’m pretty much what you expect from a professional programmer.&#0160; I have all 7 seasons of Star Trek: TNG on DVD.&#0160; I play computer games long into the night.&#0160; And when it comes to people, my official policy is “no thanks”.&#0160; I can write code for 8 hours solid without any problems.&#0160; But put me in a group of people and ask me to mingle, and I’m burnt out within an hour.</p>
<p>In a few weeks, I’ll be going to my 5th Autodesk University conference.&#0160; Here are some of the techniques I’ve picked up over the years to cope.&#0160; Don’t get me wrong, I love AU.&#0160; I just don’t ease through the conference like my extrovert co-workers.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #666666;" />
<p><strong>Be a Wallflower      <br /></strong>If you are a regular attendee, you can quietly slip into the background.&#0160; Attend the classes you care about, visit the exhibit hall, watch a few sales pitches, and you’re done.&#0160; Despite the crowds of people, you can remain fairly anonymous.&#0160; The only thing is to make sure that you don’t miss out on anything important.&#0160; If you have a question about something, make sure to hunt down the right people and get the answers you need.</p>
<p>For my first AU, I was able to mostly get away with this technique, but those days are over.&#0160; This year I’m presenting two lectures, co-presenting one lecture, presenting at ADN DevDays, providing support for ADN DevLab, and manning both the Vault and PLM 360 booths.&#0160; Also there are about a dozen contacts, inside and outside of Autodesk, that I need to hook up with while I’m there.&#0160; There is no way for me to slip into the background.&#0160; So, I’ve had to come up with some new techniques.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #666666;" />
<p><strong>Alcohol      <br /></strong>Just about every AU event has a generous supply of alcohol.&#0160; I find that one or two beers really takes the edge off.&#0160; Of course, you must know and respect your limits.&#0160; There is nothing more pathetic than getting bombed and making a fool of yourself at a <em>software convention</em>.&#0160; </p>
<p>I have to represent Autodesk, so my limit is pretty low.&#0160; I also make sure to balance things out with food, of which there is also a generous supply at AU.&#0160; Remember, this is a marathon.&#0160; Pacing is everything.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #666666;" />
<p><strong>Tablets and Smartphones      <br /></strong>For us introverts, mobile devices are probably the best inventions of all time.&#0160; If you are at a table full of people, you can just pull out your phone and start playing away.&#0160; You are not being <em>rude;</em> you are <em>working</em>!&#0160; Also, about half the people at the table will also be busy on devices too, so you won’t even look out of place.&#0160; These devices are turning everyone into introverts.&#0160; I guess we really will be inheriting the Earth.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #666666;" />
<p><strong>Get Enough Sleep and Food      <br /></strong>Social situations are exhausting enough, you don’t need to make it worse by being hungry or tired.&#0160; The goal here is to make everything as confortable as possible to counter-balance any social discomfort.&#0160; If I know I’m in for a busy day, I usually pay for the full breakfast at the hotel restaurant instead of the free conference breakfast.&#0160; It’s worth the money to insure that I can perform better.</p>

1. I wonder if there any way to save AAF-searches?
2. Got Error230 on couple cditeries:
Checked Out By Must be not empty
Checked Out Must < 21.10.2012
Seems like there is a problem with dates.
In fact I'm trying to create a search that returns list of files that are in check out for more than a week.

I don't understand how it works.
Let say our company policy requires Item to be 10 digits length.
Let say I'd like to find all that brake policy - I create couple Item-criteries:
"Number" "May" "<" "??????????"
"Number" "May" ">" "??????????"
AAF returnes just all Items...
What's wrong with my logic?

1.  If you are editing the code, then yes you can add a save/load feature.  The easiest way is to use XML Serialization on the SrchCond objects.
<a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2009/11/xml-serialization-is-your-friend.html">http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2009/11/xml-serialization-is-your-friend.html</a>

2. I didn't program in any special handling of date types.  That's a bug on my part.  The correct thing to do is convert the user text to a DateTime object, then convert to Universal Time, and then print to the format "MM/dd/yyyy HH:mm:ss".  See SrchCond documentation.

I don't think you can search on character length.  For more on how searched work, see the Vault Wiki.

1. Wrong question/wrong answer. I meant the structure of saved search (standard) differs to that used by AAF. So even if somebody would add some saving to AAFmod add-in there would be no way to use the result as standard saved search. The only way to use it - to load it back to AAFmod, right?
2. Ok I see.

Just FYI "Number" "is" "??????????" works fine in a standard Advanced Search.

If so, then "Number must equal ??????????" should give you the same result in AAF.

1. The saved search feature uses it's own XML format and doesn't have support for OR style searches.  So, no, it can't be used with AAF.

You are right. In my example one AAF criteria is more than enough. "Number" "Must" "<>" "??????????" did the trick. The operator "<>" slipped out of my attention. 
I'll return with another example soon :)

Trying to search for a value A where A is between 400 & 450.
ie find A>400 & A<450

Well one way would be to decompile the autodesk dlls ...

Technically, that's a violation of the EULA.
Aside from that, decompiling isn't a very feasible as a real world option.

1. It's time consuming.  You'll need to sift through thousands of lines of code to find answers for the simplest things.
2. It's subject to change.  Undocumented features may change at any time without warning. So, you will be doing this for every release... maybe even every service pack.
3. My experience is that you can almost never derive the meaning from just looking at the raw code.

<p>This article is such a hack that I created a new category to mark the occasion.&#0160; It goes without saying (but I’m going to say it anyway) that Autodesk isn’t going to provide support for what I’m about to say.</p>
<p>In talking with people about various Vault customizations, I find that sometimes it would be useful to get at functionality provided by a job handler.&#0160; For example, you want to create a DWF.&#0160; Theoretically, it should be possible to call directly into the DWF create job handler, so I decided to play around a bit and see if I could get it working for real.</p>
<p>Before I go into the details, let’s get abstract.&#0160; Plug-in architectures usually follow the same pattern.&#0160; There is the the hosting app, the plug-in and an interface connecting the two.&#0160; Each side is not supposed to care about what’s on the other side of the interface.</p>
<p>My test app takes advantage of that abstraction.&#0160; The DWF handler, for example shouldn’t care if it’s running inside Job Processor or not.&#0160; The handler just processes jobs.&#0160; So all I need to do is pretend to be the job processor.&#0160; I load the handler, create the DWF create job, pass it to the handler, and get a DWF file as a result.... in theory.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #deff59;" />
<p><strong>My test app      <br /></strong>The first step is to figure out which DLL to load.&#0160; Looking at JobProcessor.exe.config, I see a bunch of &lt;jobHandler&gt; elements, which tell me which job types are handled by which classes.&#0160; For this example, I decided to create DWF files.&#0160; The .config file tells me that they are all handled by the class “Connectivity.Explorer.JobHandlerDwfPublish.InventorDwfJobHandler” in the assembly “Connectivity.Explorer.JobHandlerDwfPublish”.&#0160; So let’s load Connectivity.Explorer.JobHandlerDwfPublish.dll using the System.Reflection libraries.</p>

<p>Now I have the IJobHandler object, I need to pass in an IJob (which tells the handler which operation to run on which file) and an IJobProcessorServices (which provides context information).&#0160; The IJobProcessorServices class was pretty easy to implement just by looking at the interface.&#0160; For the IJob implementation, I needed to figure out what the parameter list was.&#0160; I found this out by queuing up a DWF job from the Vault client.&#0160; Then I used the API to see what the parameters were on the job.</p>

<p><strong>Results      <br /></strong>So did the app actually work?&#0160; Yes and no.&#0160; At first, my app was a stand-alone EXE.&#0160; The app would always fail when running the Execute command.&#0160; Remember how, in theory, the handler shouldn’t care about the hosting app?&#0160; That’s not true for the DWF handler.&#0160; It definitely cares about the app context and refuses to run if the environment hasn’t been initialized properly.</p>
<p>My next attempt was to run it as a custom Vault Explorer command.&#0160; The idea is that Vault Explorer will perform whatever operation is needed to make the job handler happy.&#0160; My command actually worked.&#0160; There is brief dialog that pops up and disappears during the Execute.&#0160; But otherwise, it runs as expected.&#0160; </p>

What do you mean by "if the environment hasn’t been initialized properly"?  what I'm getting at is, can the environment be intialized properly so a stand-alone app can do the Execute command?

The quick answer is no.

There are things that need to be done before the DWF handler can run.  These things may involve creating static resources or loading a DWF library.  These steps are handled internally by Job Processor and Vault Explorer.  There is no stable way to get to these routines from an outside application.

<p>We are working on multiple fronts to address many of the Job Processor issues that people are running into.&#0160; For this post, I want to point out some command line features we added to Vault 2013.&#0160; This feature won’t fix all problems, but it has many uses.</p>
<p>You can read about the command line options from the SDK documentation or the <a href="http://wikihelp.autodesk.com/Vault/enu/Help/Help/0001-Using_Va1/0031-Manage_t31" target="_blank">wiki</a>.&#0160; The idea behind these commands is to make JobProcessor behave more like a service.&#0160; You can now programmatically start, pause, resume, and gracefully shutdown.&#0160; Previously, start and kill were the only things you could do from a command line.</p>
<p>Here are a couple of uses I came up with for these new command line operations.&#0160; Feel free to post your ideas too in the comments section.</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p><strong>Make use of idle computers</strong></p>
<p>When the CAD engineers go home for the night, use the idle computers to run Job Processor.&#0160; Create a Windows task that starts up Job Processor at 8 PM and shuts it down at 5 AM, for example.&#0160; If every CAD station does that every night, it should clear out any backups on the job queue.</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p><strong>Run certain jobs at certain times</strong></p>
<p>Maybe you would rather not process DWF files during the daytime.&#0160; You can set things up so that DWF files only get processed at night.&#0160; The first step is to copy JobProcessor.exe.config.&#0160; Next edit the copy in an XML editor and comment out all the &lt;jobHandler&gt; elemets where the <strong>class</strong> attribute starts with “Autodesk.Vault.DWF.Create”.&#0160; This config will will be the one you use when you don’t want to handle DWF files.</p>
<p>Set up a Windows task that runs at 5 AM.&#0160; The task will shut down Job Processor, swap in the non-DWF config file, then re-start Job Processor.&#0160; Because the DWF &lt;JobHandler&gt; tags are commented out, it will not process DWF files.&#0160; Set up another task at 8 PM to shut down Job Processor, swap in the original config file, then re-start.</p>
<p>Here is an example BAT file for the 8 AM task.</p>

EXCERPT:
We are working on multiple fronts to address many of the Job Processor issues that people are running into.  For this post, I want to point out some command line features we added to Vault 2013.  This feature won’t fix all problems, but it has many uses.

Hi Doug.
Is there any way to process only jobs logged by a certain user? If one of our engineers releases their document(s), we want to create a DWFx for the shop floor to view. Rather than have to process all other users releases, a particular engineer would want to process only their own files by running Job Processor locally, then check through to ensure updated details (such as revision) are correct on the DWFx.

It sounds like you just want to create the DWF locally.  In other words, you don't care about the job queue itself, you just want to execute the DWF job handler?

There is a trick you can do to execute a job handler without involving the job queue.  Basically, you load the handler DLL directly and pass it a fake job.  I think I'll make this my next blog post, so stay tuned.

To answer your original question, no, you can't reserve jobs based on the user that queued the job.

hi Doug,
i am putting a simple batch file together which will start the job processor out of normal office hours. this works fine.

i have one obstacle though for other functions...

i wish to run a batch file for JobProcessor /pause or "stop" before the day shift resume however any of the 3 commands listed on wiki such as "stop", "pause", "resume" will not work.

(a dedicated batch file will run one of those commands as i determine appropriate, if i can get it to work)... 

the batch file wil execute but error out stating that "job processor is already running"."okay" (when you click okay the batch file exits without carrying out the command).

i deployed the vault SDK thinking that perhaps there were missing DLL or handlers but after that i tested once more and they still do not run due to the same error.

workstation being used is Windows7, on vault collaboration 2012, but still using update 1 for the adms & client. (do you think that could be the issue)

Pause, Resume and Stop were added for Vault 2013.  They are not in the 2012 release.

so you have to go back and Re-submitt the jobs again ? or can you automate that process as well ? I get the same thing once its done and I try to restart to job processor it says it is already running ? and do I need to be worried about the files that have Error on them I seem to have allot of those that I have to resubmit to the job processor ?

If you change the job processor settings, you shouldn't have to re-submit any jobs.
If jobs have errors, it means they were run and something went wrong.  The error usually has something to do with the operation (for example, Inventor crashed when trying to generate a the DWF). The job processor settings won't cause job failures.

" Next edit the copy in an XML editor and comment out all the <jobHandler> elemets where the class attribute starts with “Autodesk.Vault.DWF.Create”.  " I don't understand what you mean with comment out... Delete the row (from the job/element) in the copy JobProcessor.exe.config?? Is that what you mean?

I want to run some jobs not on the working day and run these jobs in the night.

I'm looking forward for your answer!

You can delete the line if you want or you can comment it out by enclosing it in <!--    -->.  Commenting it out has the same end effect as deleting it.

You want to delete or comment <jobHandler> entries.  For example, if you want to disable DWF jobs for .iam files, your JobProcessor.exe.config would contain a line like this...
<!-- <jobHandler class="Autodesk.Vault.DWF.Create.iam" handler="Connectivity.Explorer.JobHandlerDwfPublish.DwfJobHandler, Connectivity.Explorer.JobHandlerDwfPublish"/>  -->

By "clean out" you mean delete?
No, you can't delete jobs through a prompt.  You would need to write a custom app to delete that many jobs.

I use Impersonate function in solution that allows WebDAV access to Vault files.
The user name is taken from ASP after NTLM authentication and passed to Vault.
Vault Impersonate was a good help since Windows NTLM does not support impersonation.
I cannot take NTLM ticket from user and pass it to Vault.

Doug and Jim , it is nice app! Does it is possible to create BOM's for Plant 3d, Revit , Architecture files/projects via Vault?
May be Autodesk will plan to realize this opportunities?

BOM data is set by the CAD plug-in.  If the BOM data is not being set, you should go to the Idea Exchange and suggest it as a feature.

<p>It recently came to my attention that there are no articles on using the Find <span style="text-decoration: underline;">X</span> By Search Conditions.&nbsp; So let my fix that now.&nbsp; These Find functions are the API equivalent of the Advanced Find command in the UI.&nbsp; Hopefully you are familiar with the following dialog.</p>
<p><img src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2012/FindBySearchConditions/AdvancedFind.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>The basic idea is that you construct your search criteria by chaining together a bunch of search conditions.&nbsp; The result set consists of all the entities that match the search conditions.</p>
<p>The results are returned in <strong>pages</strong> for performance reasons.&nbsp; By default 100 is the page size, but that value can be changed in ADMS Console.&nbsp; You can also define <span style="color: #232323;"><strong>sort</strong></span> criteria, so that the results come back in a specific order.&nbsp; That way you can hopefully get what you want on the first page.</p>
<p>Each major entity type has it’s own set of Find by Search Conditions functions, but they all work basically the same.&nbsp; I will be focusing mainly on FindFilesBySearchConditions for this article.</p>

<p>The code is running the same search from the screenshot at the top of the article.&nbsp; In this case, I want to gather all results, even if it’s bigger than the page size.&nbsp; I put the Find call in a while loop so that I can keep going, page by page, until I get all the results.</p>
<hr style="color: #5acb04;" noshade="noshade" />
<p><strong>Search Conditions&nbsp; <br /></strong>The SrchCond objects are the main building blocks of your search.&nbsp; Each object defines a single condition in the search.&nbsp; A condition consists of a property, a condition and a value.&nbsp; For example, “<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Author</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">is</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Doug</span>” or “<span style="text-decoration: underline;">CreateDate</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">is less than</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">6/31/2011</span>”.&nbsp; Value may not be used in some cases depending on the condition.&nbsp; For example, “<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Checked Out By</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">is not empty</span>”.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The PropTyp property basically determines if this is an advanced search or a basic search.&nbsp; “SingleProperty” means advanced search because the value only relates to a single property.&nbsp; “AllProperties” and “AllPropertiesAndContent” both refer to the basic search feature where a single value is compared against all properties.</p>
<p>SrchOper defines the comparison operator, such as “equals” or “less than”.&nbsp; It’s a number, and the SDK documentation has a table of all the legal values.</p>
<p><a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2010/12/may-and-must-search-rules.html" target="_blank">Search Rule</a> is something I covered in another article, so I won’t go over it here.&nbsp; The advanced find command in the Vault client always uses Must, which means there is an AND relationship between the conditions.</p>
<hr style="color: #5acb04;" noshade="noshade" />
<p><strong>FindFilesBySearchConditions</strong>     <br />Here is the function itself.&nbsp; I won’t be going over every parameter, but I will make sure to cover the tricky ones.</p>
<p>File[] FindFilesBySearchConditions(    <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; SrchCond[] conditions,     <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; SrchSort[] sortConditions,     <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; long[] folderIds,     <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; bool recurseFolders,     <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; bool latestOnly,     <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; ref System.string bookmark,     <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; out SrchStatus searchstatus     <br />)</p>
<p>The first parameter is the array of <strong>search conditions</strong>.&nbsp; You can pass in an empty array, which results in all Files being returned.&nbsp; It’s actually the <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2011/03/coding-for-performance-getting-all-files.html" target="_blank">most efficient way to scan through all the files in the Vault</a>.</p>
<p>Next is the array of <strong>sort</strong> objects.&nbsp; You can pass in null if you don’t care about the order.&nbsp; If you do want a sort, the SrchSort class is pretty straightforward.&nbsp; It’s a Vault property you want to sort on, and you can have it be ascending or descending.&nbsp; The input is an array so that you can sort across multiple properties.&nbsp; The first object in the array is a primary sort, the second object is the secondary sort, and so on.</p>
<p><strong>FolderIds</strong> is for cases where you want to search in a specific set of folders.&nbsp; If you want to search the whole Vault, pass in null.&nbsp; Passing in the root folder may slow performance.</p>
<p><strong>Bookmark</strong> is for when you need multiple pages returned.&nbsp; The first time you call Find, you pass in an empty string for the bookmark.&nbsp; If you don’t get all the results in the first call, bookmark will get updated.&nbsp; You can then use the bookmark for the next call and it will continue the search from where the last search left off.</p>
<p><strong>Search Status</strong> lets you know how many total results there are.&nbsp; It also lets you know if a re-index is going on.&nbsp; In the event of a re-index, your results may not be 100% accurate.&nbsp; There is not much you can do in this case aside from warning the user. </p>

It recently came to my attention that there are no articles on using the Find X By Search Conditions.  So let my fix that now.  These Find functions are the API equivalent of the Advanced Find command in the UI.

Be carefull to not use the enum Autodesk.Connectivity.WebServices.SearchOperator for SrchOper because values are not the same (SearchOperator.Equals = 1 instead of 3).

Hello, Doug,
the API call will not find linked files - true? I mean, if there are some files linked into some folder and I then search inside this folder by API, I will not find them. In Vault Client they will be found. Are there any options to find them via the API call as well?

Use FindLinksBySearchConditions to search for links.  If you want to find Files and Links within a folder, you will need to make 2 API calls, one for Files and one for Links.

Greetings Doug,
I am trying to come up with a way to search the vault for all checked out files and export the file properties to a csv file so that a separate reporting application can pick that up and format individual notifications to users who didn't check their files back in.  I have followed your code samples in the SDK and I am able to search the properties of any given drawing and find what I need to determine if the file is checked out but what I am not able to do is come up with a way to limit what folders I want to search in.  We have thousands of files that have no bearing on the search criteria that are being looked at when you use the sample code which starts with the root folder.  I am unable to figure out a way to only search specific folder and their subfolders by name. Do you have any sample code where you can point me to the correct vb.net syntax? I read your article on minimizing the number of API calls and I would like to make sure I am using the most optimum methods.  I am not sure how this list works so my direct email and how I will see a response so my direct email is djdros@derrickcorp.com

Greetings again Doug,  I did try to use this method as well:Dim filePropDefs As PropDef() = _
    m_svcMgr.PropertyService.GetPropertyDefinitionsByEntityClassId("FILE")
Dim checkedOutPropDef As PropDef = _
    filePropDefs.[Single](Function(n) n.SysName = "CheckoutUserName")
Dim projectPropDef As PropDef = _
    filePropDefs.[Single](Function(n) n.SysName = "Project")
 
' SrchOper 5 => is not empty
Dim isCheckedOut As New SrchCond() With { _
       .PropDefId = checkedOutPropDef.Id, _
       .PropTyp = PropertySearchType.SingleProperty, _
       .SrchOper = 5, _ 
       .SrchRule = SearchRuleType.Must _
}
 
' SrchOper 3 => equals
Dim padlockProject As New SrchCond() With { _
       .PropDefId = projectPropDef.Id, _
       .PropTyp = PropertySearchType.SingleProperty, _
       .SrchOper = 3, _
       .SrchRule = SearchRuleType.Must, _
       .SrchTxt = "Padlock" _
}
 
Dim bookmark As String = String.Empty
Dim status As SrchStatus = Nothing
Dim totalResults As New List(Of File)()
While status Is Nothing OrElse totalResults.Count < status.TotalHits
       Dim results As File() = _
          m_svcMgr.DocumentService.FindFilesBySearchConditions( _
           New SrchCond() {isCheckedOut, padlockProject}, _
           Nothing, Nothing, False, True, bookmark, _
              status)
 
       If results IsNot Nothing Then
              totalResults.AddRange(results)
       Else
              Exit While
       End If
End While

This does not compile and says there is a problem with "results".. does not like this line Dim results As File() = _etc
says variable 'results' hides a variable in an enclosing block so I was never able to complete testing this method.  Again direct email is djdros@derrickcorp.com

This blog is not a good place to post and debug source code.  There is a discussion group on the Vault API:  <a href="http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/vault-customization/bd-p/301">http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/vault-customization/bd-p/301</a>

I suggest you post the issue there.  Not only is it easier to read, but more people are active on the group.  You should be able to find help for you issue in the discussion group.

<p>When Vault 2012 came out, it introduced the <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2011/04/faq-events.html" target="_blank">events feature</a>, which allowed you to write your code once and have it hook to all Vault clients on the machine.&#0160; However, I want to point out that these events are <strong>version specific</strong>.&#0160; </p>
<p>This aspect wasn’t a problem in Vault 2012, because you needed the 2012 API to connect to the 2012 server.&#0160; But now, the <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2012/06/web-service-compatibility.html" target="_blank">web service compatibility feature</a> in Vault 2013 adds some complications.&#0160; The Vault 2013 server supports a mix of 2012 and 2013 clients.&#0160; For example, an engineer can use Vault Explorer 2013 and Inventor 2012 on the same vault.&#0160; If you write an event handler, <strong>it’s not going to be able to hook to both sets of clients</strong>.</p>
<p>When you write an event handler, you are writing an extension, and extensions are bound to a specific version of Vault SDK DLLs.&#0160; For example, if you use the Vault 2013 API to hook to the post check-out event, you would only get events from 2013 clients.&#0160; Any 2012 clients would completely bypass your event.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #ff5a00;" />
<p><strong>How to workaround:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>You need both the Vault 2012 SDK and Vault 2013 SDK. </li>
<li>Create an assembly project, reference the Vault 2012 SDK DLLs, and write your event handler. </li>
<li>Copy the assembly project, change the references to Vault 2013 SDK DLLs, and rebuild. </li>
<li>When you deploy, you need to deploy both assemblies to the appropriate locations. </li>
</ol>
<p>Steps 2 and 3 can be done in any order.&#0160; But the idea is you have two separate assemblies to build.</p>
<p>There are some things you can do to minimize the code copy.&#0160; One technique is the “paste as link” feature so that you can share source code projects.&#0160; You can also break out logic into a separate utility DLL, as long as it doesn’t reference any Vault DLLs.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #ff5a00;" />
<p><strong>Things that will not work:</strong></p>
<p>You are welcome to try other approaches to solving the problem, but I’m here to tell you that the following approaches will not work.&#0160; </p>
<ul>
<li>Create a Vault 2013 or 2012 extension and deploy it to both the 2012 and 2013 extension folders.&#0160; <br /><em>Vault will only load extension with the matching ApiVersion attribute.        <br /></em></li>
<li>Create an extension that references both 2012 and 2013.&#0160; <br /><em>Visual Studio will block you.        <br /></em></li>
<li>Dynamically load the correct SDK DLLs at runtime.&#0160; <br /><em>Remember that you are an event handler.&#0160; You don’t call the Vault API; the Vault API calls you.&#0160; The DLLs are already loaded.</em> </li>
</ul>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #ff5a00;" />
<p><strong>Final Notes:</strong></p>
<p>I’ve said this before, but event handlers that hook to all Vault clients is not a good idea in practice.&#0160; For a number of reasons, I’ve found that it’s much better if you can hook to a specific app.&#0160; This compatibility issue is just one more reason.</p>
<p>Here is an <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2011/07/event-scope.html" target="_blank">article on event scope</a>, if you want to know other ways to hook to web service events.</p>

It's not an app, but it would be nice to know what version of Vault a particular app, video, concept article, or tips and tricks article applies to.  I am often doing a lot of work based on outdated information.

The underlying problem is that blogs are good for "current event" style updates, but not very good at being an information archive.  What I really need is a Wiki for the Vault API.

Until then, I try to provide "update" sections when articles become obsolete.  If I missed something, feel free to drop a comment.

Doug, As non AEC user I've singled out 5 apps.
Some of them are currently 2012 other for 2011.
If I understand all right then In fact they are all applicable for Vault 2013. The only inconvenience - user need to keep all those obsolete client versions installed.
Please consider planing to update "oldest" survey-winners first ... (in order not to be tighten to 2011 client only because of couple "down-dated" but required Apps).

Well for example, in the Vault 2013 API Help file, if you search for 'thumbnail', you are directed to an article from 2009 with a code example, but the code is out of date and generates an exception.

But in addition, many code examples may run, but use outdated techniques.

I don't have a suggestion on how to remedy the situation, but as newer Vault versions come out, I can only see it getting worse.

Maybe a cross index, with each Vault version, and a list of articles that (still) apply to that version.

Sorry but my first question is not about the projesct itself:
The "My Checked Out Files" ... i don't think there is any sense to give users a list of files checked out by administrator, right?
Thus it is probably about some universal search that returns a list of files checked out by ACTIVE user, right.
If so then you probably need to share how to set up such a search without using "Prompt for value" option, please.

Doh!
The search does check for all files checked out by "Administrator".  It's probably not something you would want to push out.  I wasn't really focusing on that when I made the video.

I don't think there is a way to set up a saved search that searches for your checked out files without prompting or hard-coding a user name.

Hi Doug

Great app but would be more usefull if the grid config settings would also apply to not just the main grid, but the History, Uses and Where used tab

it doesnt appear to retain the custom columns for these tabs, any plans to include these as well?

The app is "200% must have".
Question: I see it supports no 3rd party apps, right?

Let say I'd like all our users have "My checked out files" installed (not only installed but also configured to show a list of files checked-outed by user on his log-out). But Thunderdome doesn't list the app in Plug-ins section while it lists "Watch folder".

Doug is there anything me or you can do about it?

Thunderdome only deploys apps signed with known keys.  I did this deliberately to avoid interference with the App Store.  For example, if somebody is charging $5 per download, they probably don't want Thunderdome automatically deploying it.

If an app wants to be recognized by Thunderdome, it needs to be signed with Thunderdome.snk, which is included with the source code.  See the readme for more details.

So much I'd like Project Thunderdome (PT) to do...
A. Ban users to spoil the saved searches "injected".
B. What about client Updates (in Inventor we used to call them service packs) could updates be injected with PT?

BTW, we are going to:
1. Dub PT to office domestic language (all messages bi-lingual).
2. Remove button "No and never ask me again". As alternative it worth to unistall Vault Explorer and close the access if the button is pressed (I as admin don't want to privide any support to users that neglect my recommendations).

It sounds like you are writing your own version of Thunderdome based on my source code.  That's fine with me.  

There are a couple of things I like people to do in these cases:
- Change the name of the app (which it looks like you are already doing)
- Remove Autodesk copyright info
- Don't use the orange "010" icon

Thanks

If you are talking about an unmodified Thunderdome, A and B are both no.  However if it's ever decided that Thunderdome should be built-in to Vault, then these would be good features to consider.

If you are building your own 'Dome, then B is definitely possible.  A will require some creativity, but it's also doable.

It's a good suggestion, but there is no API support for shutting down Vault Explorer.  So it's up to the user to exit the application.

I would like to see the ability to save the settings for the grid layout in the lower window as well (History, uses and where used tabs).  Also any possibility for this to be available to the Vault Basic user?

<p>I request came in for some examples of how to do Vault operations using vLogic.&#0160; So here you go.&#0160; You can never have too much sample code.&#0160; </p>
<p><a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/Files/vLogicScripts/Commands/Search.ps1" target="_blank">Search.ps</a> - This script runs an Item search.</p>
<p><a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/Files/vLogicScripts/Commands/SetItemProperty.ps1">SetItemProperty.ps1</a> - This script sets a property value on a set of selected Items.</p>
<p><a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/Files/vLogicScripts/Commands/RunChangeOrderActivity.ps1" target="_blank">RunChangeOrderActivity.ps1</a> - This script changes the state of a Change Order.</p>
<p>These scripts are basically ports of other API code examples floating around.&#0160; All I did was convert from C# or VB.NET to <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_PowerShell" rel="wikipedia" target="_blank" title="Windows PowerShell">PowerShell</a> syntax.&#0160; </p>
<p>I would like to point out that using a script doesn’t mean its any easier to program than a compiled app.&#0160; If you find a Vault API function difficult in VB.NET, then you will still find it difficult in PowerShell.&#0160; And vice versa.&#0160; Like most things, there is a trade-off.&#0160; For some things, scripting works great.&#0160; For other things, a compiled app is better.</p>
<p>I’m still new to PowerShell myself, but I’m hoping to come up with a tutorial or two on using vLogic.</p>

It hasn't been ported to Vault 2014 yet. I'm wondering if it's worth the effort for me to maintain.  I haven't had much feedback on it.
 
Are you currently using vlogic 2012 or 2013?  If so what do you use it for?

Hello Doug,

I'm trying to use this tool to search Vault for a specific subset of our Inventor Drawings.  I'm getting hung up on just running the basic "Search" Sample Code.

When I installed the vlogic application, the sample code worked.  Now I run the sample code, and I get the following:

>>
Error: Exception calling "GetProperLyDefinitionsByEntityClassId" with "1"
argument(s): "279"

Error: Exception calling "FindItemRevisionsBySearchConditions" with "5"
argument(s): "The request failed with HTTP status 404: Not Found."
>>

It has to be something simple, but if you have seen this before, can you please help me out?

Thanks a lot,
David

My guess is that you are not connected to a Vault Professional server.  So searching on items will fail because items are only in Vault Pro.

Error "279" means InvalidEntityClassName.  The "ITEM" type is only valid in Vault Pro.

HTTP 404 means it can't find the URL.  If it's not Vault Pro, there will be no ItemService URL.

<p><strong>Update</strong>:&#0160; This feature has been deprecated.&#0160; It will not be available in the next release of Vault. </p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>This is Queen Elizabeth with an important message about bicycle safety.</p>
<p>Ha!&#0160; Fooled you.&#0160; I’m just computer programmer/blogger Doug Redmond, as usual.&#0160; I pretended to be the queen to give an example of impersonation.&#0160; Please don’t hate me.</p>
<p>The Vault 2013 API now allows you to impersonate other users.&#0160; It’s a useful feature in certain cases, but it’s not without limitations.&#0160; I’ll go over the feature so that you know when and when not to impersonate another user.</p>
<p>Basically, impersonation allows an administrator to switch credentials to that of another user without the need to know the other user’s password.&#0160; When you impersonate another user in Vault, you essentially log out and log back in as the other user.&#0160; Only administrators can impersonate for obvious reasons.&#0160; However, the process of impersonation means that you give up your admin rights (unless you impersonate another admin).&#0160; When you impersonation another user, you <strong><em>are</em></strong> that other user as far as Vault is concerned, including any security limitations.</p>
<p>Your initial set of admin credentials is completely lost after the impersonate.&#0160; If you want to go back to your old identity, you need to sign-in again.&#0160; For this reason, you should not use this feature during a custom command or event handler.&#0160; In those cases, you are sharing a connection, and the parent application is still using that admin login.&#0160; You can use this feature in a job handler, however.&#0160; Each job gets its own login, so you are not going to break anything by switching to another user.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #5acb04;" />
<p>The code is fairly straightforward.&#0160; You call SecurityService.Impersonate() to switch to another user.&#0160; When the call completes, the credentials on the SecurityService switch to the new user and the old credentials are invalid.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the WebServiceManager doesn’t have built in support for impersonation.&#0160; So it’s best to throw away the old manager and create a new one after the impersonate.&#0160; For example...</p>

<p>We recently released <a href="http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/ps/dl/item?siteID=123112&amp;id=19844149&amp;linkID=9261341" target="_blank">Hotfix - API Lifecycle/Job Processor</a>, which addresses two separate API related issues in Vault 2013.&#0160; In both cases, the fixes are with Vault applications themselves, not with the SDK DLLs.&#0160;&#0160; So you don’t need to update any of your code and you don’t need to re-compile.&#0160; Just apply the hotfix if you run into any of these issues and things should work.</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p><strong>Issue 1</strong>:&#0160; If your extension hooks into change lifecycle events and adds a restriction, Vault Explorer shows a confusing error message.&#0160; The operation is restricted, as expected, but the user sees the message “restrictedEntities Files Folders and CustomEntities are all empty.”</p>
<p>After applying the hotfix, users will see the standard Restrictions Found error dialog, which can be expanded to show messages from your extension.</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p><strong>Issue 2</strong>:&#0160; When IExplorerUtil is used in a job handler extension, it will fail for all jobs after the first one.&#0160; The underlying problem is that each job gets its own login and IExplorerUtil was remembering the security context.&#0160; So IExplorerUtil would work for the first job but fail for all other jobs.&#0160; The hotfix clears out any security details that IExplorerUtil may be remembering between jobs.</p>

<p>A while back I did a custom object survey, and it turned out pretty well.&#0160; It was a nice, quick way to get feedback.&#0160; So expect more of these mini-surveys.</p>
<p>My next app will be an update of <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2011/05/thunderdome-2.html" target="_blank">Project Thunderdome</a> for Vault 2013.&#0160; I’d like to get some feedback on what I should focus on.&#0160; So please take my <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dEFHVVpySFlPYnZrbV9ILWlENTBwMGc6MQ" target="_blank">mini-survey</a> if you have an interest in this app.&#0160; Thanks.</p>
<p>UPDATE:&#0160; The survey is now closed.&#0160; Here are the results if you are interested.&#0160; It&#39;s pretty much what I expected, but I&#39;m a bit sad that vLogic didn&#39;t get any 5&#39;s.</p>

<p>Update:&#0160; The <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2013/04/deco-2014.html" target="_self">Vault 2014 version</a> of DECO is now available.</p>
<p>Take one last good look at yourself in the mirror...because I’m about to rock your face off.&#0160; Introducing Deco, the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">D</span>esign <span style="text-decoration: underline;">E</span>ditor for <span style="text-decoration: underline;">C</span>ustom <span style="text-decoration: underline;">O</span>bjects.&#0160; Deco lets you define your own custom object UI <strong>without the need for custom code</strong>.</p>
<p>Deco allows you to define your own dialog when creating a new custom object.&#0160; It allows you to define your own edit dialog.&#0160; And it allows you to have a custom tab for viewing your custom object data.</p>
<p>You start out by creating your user interface using Visual Studio:<img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2012/Deco/edit-scaled.png" /></p>
<p>Next, you hook it in to Vault Explorer:<img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2012/Deco/run.png" /></p>
<p>Deco can’t do everything, however.&#0160; Complex UI will still need custom programming.&#0160; But Deco should hit most of the common cases.&#0160; Specifically “property page” type functionality, where you want to display or edit the properties on a single object.</p>
<p>It’s probably best if you watch the how-to video on my Youtube channel.&#0160;</p>
<p>In other news, I now have a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/ItsAllJust1sAnd0s" target="_blank">Youtube channel</a>.&#0160; There is not much up there right now, but I’ll be porting over most of the videos from this blog.</p>

This is great and should become integrated into the product. If this was available for Files and Folders (looking at your source). It would offer a "Data Card" like option so many other products have. As mentioned above, this really makes custom objects worth it. Great Work.

Doug, which version of Visual Express do we need to download.  That link takes us to the site and there are several versions available.  Do I want the Web Developer?

I think they will all work.  I suggest either the C# or VB version, depending on which programming language you prefer (if any).

Doug,

Will this not work if your Vault is on a network drive?  I've created a UI, configured it as shown in your video, and Vault can't see the .xaml files.

Hello Doug! Thank you for Deco.
In my view you created a great application and it helped me﻿ to create my own solution based on it. 
At present I have an issue with Deco. Let me show it and ask a piece of advice. Thanks in advance.

Nice video.  Unfortunately DECO doesn't have support for links to other objects.  So if you want to associate your Task object to a Contact object there are a couple of options:
1. Paste contacts into the "contains" tab for the Task.
2. Write a custom dialog using .NET programming instead of DECO.

One more thing.  On the tab view, date values look better when you use a TextBox.  The DatePicker control doesn't do much since tabs are read only.

Hi Doug,

is it possible to populate a combobox with data from vault - e.g. a list of equipment that users can update. 

The idea is to use a combobox to ensure consistency of data but allow users to add to the list as required. It would be impractical to modify the design every time a list needs to be updated. Any other way of achieving this, maybe via config files?

thanks

I'm not sure if this is a DECO question or not.


If a property has a list of values associated with it, then you can use a combo box for that property in DECO.  But that is the only type of data that DECO can show in a combo box.


If this is a general Vault API question, then you can build your own UI and program a combo box to behave however you want.

Hi Doug

I've found the data from vault populates in a drop down list for a combo box automatically if there is a list setup in vault.

I do have a problem though. It seems that it only selects the list items added in vault. I have selected IsEditable in the xaml combo box?

When inputting the data manually in the deco form it doesnt update.

Any help would be great.

Thanks
Paul

I'm having difficulties getting the checkbox to work.

Can it be tagged to a boolean vault property?

Are you talking about the boolean issue or the combo box issue?

Regarding the boolean issue, I got it working on my Vault.  The reason it wasn't working for me before is that I just created the boolean property and tried to use it with DECO.  You need to restart Vault if you want DECO to pick up any new properties. 

Regarding the combo box issue, I have no plans to hotfix.

Sorry the Boolean issue.

Can you briefly show me what you did to get it working. Did you put a custom property in vault as a Boolean? Then add a checkbox in studio and tag the vault property?

Another question...sorry to annoy you.

Can a text box be linked to a number property in vault?

<p>I can’t believe I forgot to add this to the “What’s New” page in the SDK documentation.&#0160; New in the Vault 2013 API, you have the ability to jump to a different location when you custom command completes.&#0160; This is a useful feature if, for example, your command creates a folder and you want the user to navigate there.</p>
<p>To enable this feature, you just need to set GoToLocation property on the ICommandContext object that gets passed into your custom command.&#0160; It works similar to ForceRefresh.&#0160; You set the value somewhere in your custom command, and Vault Explorer performs additional actions when your command completes.&#0160; And yes, you can use GoToLocation and ForceRefresh together.&#0160; The refresh happens first, then the location jump happens next.</p>
<p>To set GoToLocation, you need to set up a new LocationContext object.&#0160; That object has 2 parts to it.&#0160; One part is the SelectionTypeId, which is basically the type of object we are navigating to.&#0160; The other part is the FullName, or path, to the object.&#0160; Because we are dealing with navigation tree locations, the currency is names and paths instead of IDs.</p>
<p>What you put for FullName is dependent on the object type.&#0160; Here is a table that explains the values.</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" width="470">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="235"><strong>Entity Class</strong></td>

Hi,

GoToLocation works but I wonder about the following:
Is it possible to call CommandItem.Execute method by code?

So I can use the GoToLocation at any time I want (also OnLogOn event).

Sorry, but you cant call GoToLocation whenever you want.  It won't work during events like LogOn or LogOff.  It also won't work inside of a custom tab.

Thanks you for your post!

I hoped to store a session state at OnlogOff and jump to the last location OnLogOn. But all this will need to work by CommandItems(Buttons).

I see I can't use GoToLocation for SelectionTypeId.FileVersion and SelectionTypeId.Bom because there is no fullname for it.

GoToLocation only works after your command exits the Execute function.  

So if you want to navigate while keeping your dialog open, then the answer is no.  But if you want to close your dialog before navigating, then the answer is yes.

There are some sample apps that use GoToLocation and a custom dialog:  
- Advanced Advanced Find 2014
- Find Orphaned Files

I'm not able to get it to work for Custom Entities. I want to select the created CustomEntity:

CustEntDef CED = GetCustomerEntityDefinition(CustEntName, ServiceManager);
CustEnt CE = ServiceManager.CustomEntityService.AddCustomEntity(CED.Id, "testing");
if (CE != null) e.Context.GoToLocation = new LocationContext(new SelectionTypeId(CED.Name), CE.Id.ToString());

I don't know, I never tried it.  If it works, it's an unsupported feature.

The preferred behavior is that you go to the object the link points to, and not go to the link itself.

<p>New to Vault 2013 is the ability to compress data when uploading or downloading files.&#0160; By default, file data is uncompressed, just like it has been in previous releases.&#0160; This article will show you how to enable the compression feature so that you can see performance gains when transferring large amounts of file data.</p>
<p>LZ4 is only compression algorithm that Vault supports.&#0160; We looked into ZIP, but it was too slow.&#0160; The time it took to zip and unzip offset the time we saved with smaller network traffic.&#0160; So we decided on LZ4 because it was much quicker.&#0160; If you have a slow network or do a lot of file transfer, you will definitely want to enable this feature.&#0160; Even if you do small amounts of file transfer, it doesn’t hurt to turn the feature on.</p>
<p>The steps to enable compression in Vault are pretty easy.&#0160; First, you create a CompressionHeader for your DocumentService.&#0160; Next you transfer the data and do the compression or decompression.&#0160; It’s best if I just show the source code.&#0160; The ByteArray class will make much more sense.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #ff5a00;" />
<p>NOTE:&#0160; You will need to get an LZ4 library for the compression and decompression.&#0160; <a href="http://code.google.com/p/lz4/" target="_blank">Here is one such library</a>.</p>

<p>If you have a large file which needs to be transferred in multiple parts, each part gets compressed/decompressed independently. For example, if a file requires you to call DownloadFilePart twice, you would run LZ4 decompression twice.&#0160; You would download the first part, decompress it, download the second part, decompress the second part, then combine the two decompressed byte arrays.</p>

EXCERPT:
New to Vault 2013 is the ability to compress data when uploading or downloading files.  By default, file data is uncompressed, just like it has been in previous releases.  This article will show you how to enable the compression feature so that you can see performance gains when transferring large amounts of file data.

Any benchmark number, to back up the claim that it helps for file transfer ?

PS I could not find the LZ4Sharp.dll to download, so I had to download the LZ4Sharp project and build it(which required me to install the CodeBlocks program).

If a file is uploading compressed, will there be a problem doing a Get from the vault client since the data is compressed?

The compression only applies to the data transfer.  Once it gets to the other side, the data is decompressed.

So all the files in the file store will be decompressed, even if compression was used for the upload.

<p>My friends over at coolOrange have come out with <a href="http://blog.coolorange.com/" target="_blank">a blog of their own</a>.&#0160; It’s still young, but there are already some good articles up there, especially if you are a PowerShell fan.&#0160; Blogs are mainly fueled by active readership.&#0160; So if you want more articles (and I know I do), then make sure to let them know.</p>

<p>For the first time ever, I’ll be copying an article from the SDK to my blog.&#0160; Usually it goes on my blog first before going into the knowledge base.&#0160; Anyway, most of you probably didn’t notice the new knowledge base article titled “Extension Loading Error Logging” in the Vault 2013 SDK.&#0160; My colleague, Dan Dulzo, wrote the article after adding a feature that lets you log the load errors for any of your Vault extensions.</p>
<p>Sometimes, Vault extensions are loaded into environments without a GUI, such as an event handler. Unfortunately, if the extension fails to load due to errors, it will fail silently. As an SDK programmer, this can cause confusion when trying to develop and deploy an extension. Fortunately, the SDK can be configured to log these errors, allowing developers to see (and hopefully fix) what went wrong when loading an extension.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #ff5a00;" />
<p><strong>Configuring Logging</strong></p>
<p>To enable logging, deploy an xml file named ExtensionLogConfig.xml to the same directory that extensions are deployed to (ex. C:\Program Data\Autodesk\Vault 2013\Extensions). Upon loading an extension, this directory is checked for the configuration file, and if it is found, logging is enabled. The <strong>ExtensionLogConfig.xml</strong> file has a pretty simple format. An example can be seen below.</p>

<p>The <strong>BaseFileName</strong> element specifies the location of the output log file, as well as the base file name of the file. The <strong>DateFormat</strong> element tells the logger the how to format the date when appending it to the log file name. The <strong>KeepLogsFor</strong> sets the number of days to keep log files for. The logger will attempt to automatically delete log files with a date older than the specified number of days. Using a value of -1 will cause the logger to delete any previous log information each time an extension attempts to load. Finally, the <strong>FileExtension</strong> element is used to specify the file extension to use for the log files.</p>
<p>Note: If there are no extensions to load, logging will not be performed regardless of any configuration file.&#0160; Also, if the configuration file cannot be read due to being malformed or any other reason, logging will not be enabled.</p>
<p>The logger will write out what extensions load successfully and various error messages for extensions that failed to load. Most errors will result in a descriptive message getting written to the error log. Problems, such as having incorrect assembly attributes or missing a public contractor for your extension class, should be easy to identify when reading the log.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #ff5a00;" />
<p><strong>Common Problems</strong></p>
<p>Unfortunately, the logger will not be able to provide a useful message in certain situations when the extension loader doesn&#39;t know enough about why an extension failed to load. In these cases, the log will contain a generic message resembling &quot;Could not load file or assembly...&quot; or sometimes no message at all. Below are some descriptions of common problems and likely solutions to a few situations where the logger will be unable to provide specific information about why an extension failed to load.</p>
<p><em>Problem 1: No log file is created</em></p>
<p>If an extension is failing to load and there is no log file being created, double-check that your ExtensionLogConfig.xml file is properly formatted xml. Ensure that the configuration file has appropriate values for all of the configuration settings, i.e. the complete file name is valid, DateFormat is an appropriate date format string, Vault has permission to create files in the directory specified in BaseFileName, etc. Next, check that the ExtensionLogConfig.xml has been deployed to the correct directory. A common mistake here is deploying an ExtensionLogConfig.xml file to each extension&#39;s directory. There should be only one configuration file and it should be deployed to the Extensions directory(C:\Program Data\Autodesk\Vault 2013\Extensions\ExtensionLogConfig.xml), NOT to a specific extension&#39;s directory (C:\Program Data\Autodesk\Vault 2013\Extensions\[Some Extension&#39;s Name]\ExtensionLogConfig.xml). Finally, check to make sure at least one extension is configured to load because no log file is created if there will be nothing to log.</p>
<p><em>Problem 2: An extension failed to load but there is nothing about the failed extension in the log file</em></p>
<p>The log file will always output messages for extensions that successfully load and extensions that try to load. If there are no message of an extension in the log file, it essentially means that Vault is unaware of the extension, and in fact, didn&#39;t even try to load it. The key thing to check in this situation is the .vcet.config file that is supposed to be deployed along with each extension. Make sure this file has the right name, is well formed, contains all the necessary information about the extension, and is in the correct directory. It&#39;s important to remember that the .vcet.config file is what lets Vault know of each extension to load. Another issue to check is that all extension files are deployed to the correct directory as well.</p>
<p><em>Problem 3: The log contains the vague error message of &quot;Could not load file or assembly...&quot;</em></p>
<p>For whatever reason, the extension loader could not load some sort of file or assembly referenced by an extension. The most common root cause of this message is that something is missing. Usually, the first thing to check is that all assemblies referenced by an extension are deployed along-side it (unless they are available in the GAC). Please note that certain SDK assemblies referenced by an extension do not need to be deployed with each extension because they are already loaded by Vault. Another possible cause is that the failed extension references the wrong version of the SDK assemblies, so be sure to check this as well.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/SampleApp3.png" /></p>
<p>I recently decided to join the 21st century and get a smartphone.&#0160; And guess what, you can write programs on these things.&#0160; I just happen to be a programmer, so it’s app writing time!!!&#0160; Fish gotta’ swim; birds gotta’ fly.</p>
<p>This is just a proof-of-concept app.&#0160; It doesn’t do anything useful, but I wanted to prove that it could be done.&#0160; The app is a port of the VaultList sample in the SDK.&#0160; It lists out all the files in the Vault.&#0160; That’s all it does.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2012/Android/screenshot.png" /></p>
<p><strong>Requirements:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Vault 2013 </li>
<li>An Android device - v2.1 or later </li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/Apps/Android/VaultList.apk" target="_blank">Click here for the app</a> <br /><a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/Apps/Android/VaultList-Android-src.zip" target="_blank">Click here for the source code</a></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #013181;" />
<p><strong>Installation and Usage:</strong></p>
<p>To get the app installed, you need to go into your phone settings an allow apps from unknown sources (non-Market locations).&#0160; Next you need to get the .apk file installed somehow.&#0160; The only way I found was to email it to my gmail account.&#0160; When I use the Gmail client on my phone, it allows me to install the app.</p>
<p>Running the app is pretty straightforward.&#0160; There are fields for the Vault information.&#0160; Fill it in and hit run.&#0160; You need a Wi-Fi connection to the network where Vault is running.&#0160; If you are having trouble connecting, try using the IP address of the Vault server.&#0160; You can also try opening your phone’s browser and going to http://[server]/AutodeskDM/Services/v17/DocumentService.asmx to verify that your phone can locate the Vault server.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #013181;" />
<p><strong>Source Code:</strong></p>
<p>The code is written in Java using the Eclipse IDE.&#0160; It’s similar to my other <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2010/01/java-vault-client.html" target="_blank">Java sample app</a>.&#0160; For the Android app, I used a library called <a href="http://code.google.com/p/ksoap2-android/" target="_blank">ksoap2</a> to make the web service calls to Vault.&#0160; My code is written bottom-up.&#0160; I only implemented the Vault API functions and classes that I needed.&#0160; I didn’t implement the entire DocumentService or File class, for example.&#0160; However the pattern for implementing these functions and classes is pretty obvious.</p>
<p>Special thanks to the <a href="http://java.dzone.com/articles/invoke-webservices-android" target="_blank">DZone blog article</a> for instructions on using ksoap2.&#0160; These developer blogs are quite helpful!</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #013181;" />
<p><strong>Future plans:</strong></p>
<p>I would like to write a useful mobile app for Vault one day.&#0160; So if you have any ideas on what that app should be, post a comment.</p>
<p>I have no plans to develop in iPad or iPhone since it requires me to spend thousands of dollars buying a Mac.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: xx-small;">As with all the samples on this site, the </span><a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/disclaimer.html"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">legal disclaimer</span></a><span style="font-size: xx-small;"> applies. </span></p>

How about displaying the list of change orders requiring my input along with some basic information associate to the change order?  Perhaps develop it further to display detailed information on the selected change order.

Great start Doug, keep going.

IF "saved searches" were stored with the Vault user in the DB, THEN it would be great if the app just ran them. You could make any query you wanted and run them from anywhere in the company.

Instead, you could create saved searches in the app and run them on demand.

<p>The survey response was overwhelmingly in favor of custom objects, so I will make use of that feature where it makes sense to.&#0160; I’ll try not to go overboard... no promises.</p>
<p>Here are the results:   <br /><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2012/CustomObjectsSurvey/results.png" /></p>
<p>BTW, Google Docs is a great free way to create simple surveys.&#0160; Special thanks to <a href="http://www.philjohncock.com/google-surveys/" target="_blank">Phil Johncock’s blog article</a> on how to set these up.</p>

<p>I have a dilemma, so I need you guys to fill out a quick survey for me.&#0160; On one hand I want to take advantage of the Custom Objects feature with my apps.&#0160; On the other hand, using that feature restricts the app to Vault Professional only.</p>
<p>For example, the 2013 version of <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2011/05/thunderdome-2.html" target="_blank">Project Thunderdome</a> could do some really cool things with custom objects, but any Workgroup/Collab users would be unable to use it.</p>
<p>Please take my 2 question survey to let me know what I should focus on.</p>
<p>UPDATE:&#0160; Survey is now closed.</p>

<p>What do Abraham Lincoln, Genghis Khan and Mozart have in common?&#0160; Besides being dead, I really don’t know.&#0160; But that’s OK because it has nothing to do with this article.</p>
<p>This article is about the new <a href="http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/Autodesk-Vault-Idea-Exchange/idb-p/2" target="_blank">Autodesk Vault Idea Exchange</a>, which is where you (yes, <em>you</em>) get to propose Vault features.&#0160; Although we have many avenues for requesting features, such as discussion groups, the Idea Exchange is built specifically for this purpose.</p>
<p>Ideas can be posted, discussed and tracked.&#0160; You can also vote on ideas using the Kudos system.&#0160; Kudos is like “Like” in Facebook.&#0160; If you see something you agree with, you click on the Kudos button, and the Kudos number for that feature goes up +1.&#0160; The ideas with the most Kudos show up higher in the list.&#0160;</p>
<p>So go forth and <a href="http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/Autodesk-Vault-Idea-Exchange/idb-p/2">give us your ideas</a>.&#0160; API suggestions are fair game.&#0160; In fact, you are almost guaranteed a Kudos from me if you post an API related idea.&#0160; Yummy!</p>

<p>The Lazy class is a nice little tool that was added in .NET 4.&#0160; Like the name implies, it helps with <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazy_initialization" rel="wikipedia" target="_blank" title="Lazy initialization">lazy initialization</a> of data.&#0160; That way the data is initialized when you ask for it instead of when you class is constructed.</p>
<p>This is useful when programming with Vault because there are many times you need to look up server data and store it.&#0160; For example, let’s say you have a custom command that makes use of a specific property definition.&#0160; At some point you need to get the PropDef object from Vault server, but when is the best time?&#0160; You don’t want to do it during OnLogOn because it costs time to look up the PropDef, and the user may not run your command.&#0160; The best time to get the PropDef is the first time your command is run.&#0160; Then you store the object so that subsequent calls don’t have to make the same server request again.</p>
<p>Here is how you would look up the Author PropDef with Lazy:</p>

The Lazy class is a nice little tool that was added in .NET 4.  Like the name implies, it helps with lazy initialization of data.  That way the data is initialized when you ask for it instead of when you class is constructed.

<p>Hopefully you already know that Vault 2012 clients can access the Vault 2013 server without the need for any sort of software update.&#0160; This compatibility feature works at the web service API level.&#0160; Basically, anything that uses the Vault 2012 APIs can connect to Vault 2013.</p>
<p>What is compatible with Vault 2013 server:</p>
<ul>
<li>2013 applications. </li>
<li>2012 CAD clients such as AutoCAD, Inventor and Civil 3D.</li>
<li>Vault 2012 clients such as Vault Explorer, Autoloader and JobProcessor.</li>
<li>Any standalone application that calls the 2012 web services. </li>
</ul>
<p>What is not compatible:</p>
<ul>
<li>2013 clients are not compatible with the Vault 2012 server.&#0160; The compatibility only works one way. </li>
<li>Anything that is a 2012 plug-in will not be compatible with the 2013 clients.&#0160; This includes custom commands, job handlers, and event handlers. </li>
<li>Anything that uses Vault 2012 API components outside the Autodesk.Connectivity.WebServices assembly may not be compatible in Vault 2013. </li>
</ul>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #5acb04;" />
<p><strong>Architecture:</strong></p>
<p>An API is basically an interface to an application’s functionality.&#0160; For Vault 2013, the server exposes two interfaces: the Vault 2012 set of web services and the Vault 2013 set of services.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2012/Compatibility/diagram.png" /></p>
<p>It’s pretty straightforward.&#0160; The services are distinguished by the service URL.&#0160; Starting in 2013, there is a version component to the service URL.&#0160; <br />For example:     <br />2012 URL:&#0160; http://localhost/AutodeskDM/Services/DocumentService.asmx     <br />2013 URL:&#0160; http://localhost/AutodeskDM/Services/<strong>v17</strong>/DocumentService.asmx</p>
<p>If you are using Autodesk.Connectivity.WebServices.dll, it will only communicate with the web services interface for the corresponding version.&#0160; So the 2012 DLL (16.0.x.x) will communicate only with the 2012 web services, and the 2013 DLL(17.0.x.x) will communicate only with the 2013 web services.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #5acb04;" />
<p><strong>Best Practices:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Testing is still needed!</strong>&#0160; <br /><em>Don’t assume that everything works perfectly.        <br /></em></li>
<li><strong>Code to only 1 API version.</strong>&#0160; <br /><em>For example, don’t check out with the 2012 API and check in with the 2013 API.        <br /></em></li>
<li><strong>If you are building a 2013 client, use the 2013 services.        <br /></strong></li>
<li><strong>Don’t hard-code data that may be version specific. </strong>&#0160; <br /><em>For example, don’t write logic around the server’s version number.        <br /></em></li>
<li><strong>Assume that your client may be used with a future Vault server.</strong>&#0160; <em>However, Autodesk makes no guarantee that Vault 2014 will still have this compatibility feature.</em> </li>
</ul>

<p><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/SampleApp3.png" /></p>
<p>For this post, I bring you <strong>two whole apps</strong>.&#0160; I’ve updated Q-Tools and Watch Folder for Vault 2013.&#0160; Technically the 2012 versions can still work with Vault 2013 server, but there were a few optimizations I wanted to do using the new API features.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #013181;" />
<p><strong>Q-Tools 2013</strong></p>
<p>For Q-Tools, the feature set is the same as before, but I make use of the new Job.IsOnSite parameter to determine if a job needs to be rerouted or not.</p>
<p>Here is the full feature list:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Logging</strong> - Issues are logged to a text file. </li>
<li><strong>Stale Job Detection</strong> - Jobs on the queue too long can be considered an issue. </li>
<li><strong>Email Reports</strong> - Issues can be emailed to one or more recipients. </li>
<li><strong>Queue Cleanup</strong> - Jobs with issues can be automatically removed from the queue. </li>
<li><strong>Queue Forwarding</strong> - In multi-site and multi-workgroup environments, jobs can get routed to a single site. </li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2011/QTools/email.png" /></p>
<p><strong>Requirements:      <br /></strong>- Vault Workgroup/Collaboration/Professional 2013     <br />- Job Server feature enabled     <br /><a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/Apps/QTools/Q-Tools.3.0.1.0-bin.zip">Click here to download the application</a> <br /><a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/Apps/QTools/Q-Tools.3.0.1.0-src.zip">Click here to download the source code</a></p>
<p><a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2011/07/q-2ools.html" target="_self">Click here for Q-Tools 2012</a></p>
<p><strong>To setup:      <br /></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Designate a computer on the network that the Q-Tools service should run on.&#0160; Only 1 Q-Tools can be running for a given Vault deployment. </li>
<li>Run the installer. </li>
<li>Go to the installation folder and update the settings.xml.&#0160; The XML comments will explain this step. </li>
<li>Run the Q-Tools service. </li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2011/QTools/Services-scaled.png" /></p>
<p><strong>Migrating from Q-Tools 2012:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Actually I don&#39;t recommend migrating.&#0160; The 2012 Q-Tools version should work fine with the Vault 2013 server.&#0160; </li>
<li>If you still want to migrate, it should be fairly easy.&#0160; The Settings.xml has not changed.&#0160; I recommend making a copy of the XML file, uninstall Q-Tools 2012, then install Q-Tools 2013.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-size: xx-small;">As with all the samples on this site, the </span><a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/disclaimer.html"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">legal disclaimer</span></a><span style="font-size: xx-small;"> applies. </span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #013181;" />
<p><strong>Watch Folder 2013</strong></p>
<p>Although the feature set is the same, the setup is much easier.&#0160; No longer do you have to configure Windows tasks to add notification jobs to the queue.&#0160; Using the new features on IJobHander, the jobs are added from JobProcessor plug in.&#0160; Right before JobProcessor goes idle, Watch Folder puts a new notification job on the queue.&#0160; That way new files are checked every time JobProcessor cycles.</p>
<p>In case you aren&#39;t familiar with it, Watch Folder is an app that allows you to &quot;watch&quot; a set of Vault folders so that you receive email notifications when files get added or updated in those folders.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2011/WatchFolder/Inbox.png" /></p>
<p><strong>Requirements:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Vault Workgroup/Collaboration/Professional 2013</li>
<li>Job Server enabled </li>
<li>An SMTP server somewhere on the network </li>
</ul>
<p>NOTE:&#0160; This isn&#39;t something you can just download and run.&#0160; The Vault administrator needs to set up some server components before this feature can be used.</p>
<p><a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/Apps/WatchFolder/WatchFolder-3.0.3.0-bin.zip" target="_self">Click here to download the application</a> <br /><a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/Apps/WatchFolder/WatchFolder-3.0.3.0-src.zip" target="_self">Click here to download the source code</a></p>
<p><a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2011/11/watch-folder-2012.html" target="_self">Click here for Watch Folder 2012</a></p>
<p><strong>To use</strong></p>
<p>For Vault users, download the application and run the installer.&#0160; Just make sure that the administrator has set up the Vault environment first.&#0160; Next, start up Vault Explorer and right-click on a folder that you want to watch.&#0160; Select the Watch Folder command and decide how frequently you want notifications.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2010/WatchFolder/menuCommand.png" /></p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2010/WatchFolder/dialog.png" /></p>
<p>For Vault administrators, download the application and run the installer.&#0160; Next follow the instructions in the readme file in the install folder (%ProgramData%\Autodesk\Vault 2013\Extensions\WatchFolder).</p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A watch on a folder will automatically apply to any sub-folders. </li>
<li>Removing a watch will also remove watches on sub-folders. </li>
<li>You can&#39;t have an immediate watch and a summary watch on the same folder.&#0160; Setting a folder to one type overwrites the existing setting. </li>
<li>You need to be at least Document Editor (level 1) in order to set up a watch on a folder. </li>
<li>You need to have a valid email address in your Vault user settings. </li>
<li>The contents of the email can be customized by the Vault administrator.&#0160; See readme file. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Migrating from Watch Folder 2012:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>WatchSettings.xml now needs a Vault username and password.&#0160; Everything else is the same, so you can just add &lt;Vault_Username&gt; and &lt;Vault_Password&gt; tags to your existing config file.&#0160; The Vault user must be able to add and delete jobs from the queue.</li>
<li>All the other settings files from R1 can still be used, just copy over WatchCollection.xml and WatchEmailBody over to the install folder. </li>
</ul>

Doug, could you give any advice for those whos Q-tools service never starts automatically even so has "Automatic" Start type. Starting manually works fine.

Hi Doug, Sorry to bother so close to AU. But is it possible to specify that an email be sent to the user who submitted the job, rather than a static list? Through the settings.xml file?

No QTools doesn't do that, but it's a great idea.  Maybe I'll get that in to the 2014 release.

What might be the reason of the problems?
PS: Vault Explorer does can connect to all replicated sites.

Doug, could you consider adding some extra setting to Q-tools?
"Error message" should be taken to account in <CleanUpJobTypes>. Typically I prefer to delete issued jobs manually but I'd like jobs with particular errors be deleted automatically.   
For example "Unable to retrieve File version for id" doesn't require humans attention.
I can predict some challenge for my wish to be done - error message returned by Job Processor could be localized, but i belive you know how to proceed.
Thanks (Jast in case).

Hi Doug,
Let me ask you one more question about two issues I faced while testing the WatchFolders. <a href="http://youtu.be/98j_JC_2rIw">http://youtu.be/98j_JC_2rIw</a>
I am looking forward to hearing from you.

There is something wrong with your setup.  If things are working well, you should almost always see a Autodesk.WatchFolder.NotificationJob on the queue.  It's like a perpetual job that insures that notifications go out every time the job processor cycles.  There should be an error log for Job Processor.  That might give you some hints on what's wrong.

Watch Folder Readme references some "QueueJob utility".
I remember to see it somwhere but can't find it nowadays.
Where should I search for the utility?

QueueJob is no longer needed in the 2013 version.  I thought I removed all references in the readme, but I must have missed some.

In 2012 QueueJob was a separate exe needed to add the Notification jobs to the queue.  In 2013, the Job Processor plug-in is able to add the jobs directly.

Is it ok that «Setting a watch folder for user» job is in the queue even when no users have set any notification?

The longer I use Q-tools the more I think I should allow deleting error jobs of DWF.Create type.
The only inconvenience stops me now - I would have no choice but to check for log each time (now i alwost never use its log).
As we use the unique filename approach I'd rather prefer to get by mail not Id of the job but filename that had an error (at least as extra info). AFAIK Q-tools now have no option to customize e-mail, right?

BTW, Why <Site> column is not available in Job Queue Table? 
Could Administrator determine where the job came from? I know the info would be in q-tool log (in case it will get there)? Or it's impossible without using API?

No, I don't think you can customize the emails for Q-Tools.

What column are you looking for in the Job Queue window?  At the API level there is a Boolean that tells if the Job lives on the site that you are logged in to.  But there is no value that contains the name of the site.

Doug, our Vault configuration is Connected Workgroups. Q-tools works fine for all jobs within that workgroup which it belongs to but as soon as I try add to its config new site section (< are replaced with #):
#Site>
    #Name>CS-Dvault#/Name>
    #Hostname>Full-name-of-the-workgroup2-ADMS#/Hostname>
    #IsSSL>false#/IsSSL>
    #Port>80#/Port>
    #IsCentralQueue>false#/IsCentralQueue>
#/Site>

Q-tool service refuse to start (error 1053).
Coould you advice how to debug this?
Thanks in advance.

I'll have to see the full config file (feel free to blank out password values).  Just send it to me in an email.  You have my email address, right?

To my mind WatchCollection.xml needs some more inteligence.
Now it doesn't contain ADMS-names (only Vault names) thus Job Processor connected to one ADMS does generate useless requests to the vault of another ADMS (if it was connected to it previously).

I don't see any problems with the config file.  Error 1053 is not coming from Vault.  It's a Windows Service error code meaning that the service did not start in time.

Are there connection problems with one of the servers?  Or is there a typo in one of the server names?

QTools should be writing out a log file, which may give more details about the problem.

Unfortunately I don't know how to determine server connection problems (the name of server in that new section is pinging OK).
We do have occasional performance issues but i don't know why.
I don't see any hints in Qtool log.
One more thing about jobs seems strange to me - jobs from that particular server have 11 digitts in their ID while jobs from all the rest servers have 6-digits IDs. Is it something that could be tuned by Vault admin?

Hi, Doug

Are you planning to migrate the 2013 version of Watch folder to 2014?. For me and my customer would be excellent!
Thanks!

Sorry, this is not on my list of apps to update.

However Autodesk Consulting has a product called "Enterprise Add-On for Vault"  (VAO for short) which does email notifications.

<p>In Vault 2013, we shifted over to .NET 4.&#0160; This isn’t just an API change, the product itself shifted too.&#0160; In fact, I think all Autodesk products using .NET were told to shift over.&#0160; The whole suites thing forces our products to be on the same technology platforms whenever possible.</p>
<p>Anyway, here is what you need to know as a programmer.&#0160; .NET 2 through 3.5 used the same CLR (common language runtime), which meant that they were very compatible.&#0160; However .NET 4 uses a new CLR, which means that there are now compatibility issues between .NET 4 and older .NET versions.&#0160; For example, a .NET 3.5 app cannot load a 4.0 assembly.</p>
<p>If you are working with a 3.5 app and want to communicate with Vault 2013 server, you have a few options.&#0160; One option is to use the 2012 version of Autodesk.Connectivity.WebServices, which will have 16 as the version number.&#0160; Those DLLs will still be able to communicate with the 2013 server.&#0160; The downside is that you will not have the newest features, such as custom entities.&#0160; Another option is to use the Autodesk.Connectivity.WebServices from the SharePoint 2010 integration.&#0160; Because SharePoint 2010 uses .NET 3.5, we had to create a special DLL for it.&#0160; You can get this DLL from ADN, however we do not provide official support for it.</p>
<p>Other aspects of .NET 4:</p>
<ul>
<li>Visual Studio 2010 or higher must be used</li>
<li>Any project referencing a Vault API assembly must be .NET 4</li>
<li>.NET 4 framework must be installed on computers running the app.&#0160; The Vault installers definitely do this step during their install, and I think most other Autodesk installers do too.</li>
<li>If you are writing an extension to Vault, such as a custom command, you can load in older version assemblies.&#0160; However it’s recommended to use .NET 4 whenever possible.</li>

<p>One of the optimizations in Vault 2013 is the use of JPEG as the format for storing thumbnails.&#0160; Previously, the format used by the CAD file was stored in the database.&#0160; For example, Inventor uses the metafile format, which is usually much bigger than a JPEG when at thumbnail size.&#0160; Regardless of what format the file’s thumbnail is, the Vault 2013 Server converts it to JPEG when storing it in the database.</p>
<p>What this means for the Vault developer is that you have to handle 2 possible image formats if you want to render thumbnail data.&#0160; You need to handle the metafile format for files added in Vault 2012 and earlier and you need to handle the JPEG format for files added in Vault 2013.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong>&#0160; This utility is no longer available.</p>
<p>The first release of the Vault/PLM 360 integration has been released.&#0160; Just like with the <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2011/07/autodesk-vault-for-sharepoint-2010.html">SharePoint 2010 integration</a>, I was involved in the design and implementation of this tool.&#0160; So I thought I would share my thoughts on the project and go over the technical details.</p>
<p>You can get PLM 360 Sync from the <a href="http://subscription.autodesk.com/">subscription center</a>.&#0160; PLM 360 Sync only works with Vault Professional 2013 since items are the only things synchronized in R1.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #5acb04;" />
<p><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">Integration is in the eye of the beholder</span></strong></p>
<p>Everyone reading this post probably has a different idea on what a Vault/PLM 360 integration means.&#0160; For this reason, it’s hard to put out a single utility that is supposed to serve everyone’s needs.&#0160; We solved this problem by taking an incremental approach.&#0160; This first release is not meant to be everything to everyone.&#0160; It has a limited feature set which we will be building on in future releases.&#0160;</p>
<p>This incremental approach allows us to gather feedback.&#0160; Based on that feedback we will add new features, expand on what is working well and fix things that are not working well.</p>
<p>Currently, the <a href="http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/Autodesk-PLM-360/bd-p/705">PLM 360 discussion group</a> is the best place to give feedback.&#0160; Your suggestions will definitely get more eyeballs than comments on blog.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #5acb04;" />
<p><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">The R1 Feature Set</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Item Synchronization (one way)</strong> -&#0160; Released and obsolete items in Vault get replicated to PLM.&#0160;</p>
<p><strong>Seamless Integration</strong> - The idea is that the average Vault user doesn’t have to do anything special.&#0160; They just use Vault as normal, and all the integration stuff happens in the background.&#0160;</p>
<p><strong>Configurability</strong> - The Vault administrator has a lot of options regarding what and how data gets synchronized.</p>
<p><strong>Property Mapping</strong> - Any Vault item property (except thumbnails) can be mapped to a PLM field.&#0160;</p>
<p><strong>Revision History</strong> - When an item is synchronized, all revisions get synchronized.&#0160; So you can view the item history in PLM 360 just like you can in Vault.</p>
<p><strong>BOM</strong> - The entire BOM is synchronized, not just a single item.&#0160; Again, the result is an identical data in Vault and PLM 360.</p>
<p><strong>Item Selection</strong> - By default, all released and obsolete items get synchronized.&#0160; However, you can use the search mechanism to specify exactly what Vault items should be copied.</p>
<p><strong>Multiple Tenants\Workspaces</strong> - Your items don’t have to go to one and only one spot in PLM 360.&#0160; You can sync your items to multiple locations in PLM 360.&#0160; Each location can have its own criteria.&#0160; For example, all Vault items from project X can go to one spot in PLM 360 while items from project Y go to a different location.</p>
<p><strong>Bulk Load</strong> - If you are starting with a lot of Vault items, you can queue them up for synchronization with a click of the Rebuild History button.&#0160; This is also a good tool to have if something goes wrong and you are unsure of which items are replicated and which are not.</p>
<p><strong>Error Handling</strong> - If something goes wrong with a synchronization, for example a mapped property no longer exists in PLM 360, the result is an error job in the Vault Job queue.&#0160; Once the problem is fixed, the Vault admin can re-submit the job.</p>
<p><strong>Does Not Consume a Vault License</strong> - During regular operations, the sync tool does not use up a Vault license.&#0160; This feature is possible because the tool only reads from Vault.&#0160; If/when we add a 2-way sync feature, we may have to require a license at that point.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #5acb04;" />
<p><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">Technical Details</span></strong></p>
<p>There are 2 main parts to PLM 360 Sync.&#0160; There is a Sync Service and there is a configuration command.&#0160; The configuration command is in Vault Explorer, and it’s what the administrator uses to determine which Vault items go to which workspaces in PLM 360.</p>
<p>The Sync Service is a Windows Service that does the actual work.&#0160; It reads data from Vault, connects to PLM 360, determines what needs to be updated and makes the changes to PLM 360.</p>
<p>Here is the basic order of operations:</p>
<ol>
<li>User releases an item in Vault. </li>
<li>Vault server adds a job to the job queue indicating that an item has changed.&#0160; This step does not happen immediately. </li>
<li>Sync Service reads the job off the job queue and performs the necessary updates in PLM 360.&#0160; This step also does not happen immediately. </li>
</ol>
<p>The Job Queue is pretty central to how PLM 360 Sync works.&#0160; The queue tells the Sync Service which items may need to be synchronized.&#0160; It also is a repository for errors that may happen.&#0160; It’s very important that there be a way to re-do a sync in the case of a failure.</p>
<p>Even though the job queue is used, Job Processor has nothing to do with PLM 360 Sync.&#0160; The Sync Service talks directly to the job queue, so Job Processor is not required.&#0160; <strong>Sync Service and Job Processor are completely orthogonal to each other.</strong>&#0160; The actions of one do not affect the actions of the other.&#0160; For example, if Job Processor is busy with 1000 DWF create jobs, the Sync Service runs as normal.&#0160; It does <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">NOT</span></strong> have to wait for the 1000 DWF jobs to complete.</p>

The first release of the Vault/PLM 360 integration has been released.  Just like with the SharePoint 2010 integration, I was involved in the design and implementation of this tool.  So I thought I would share my thoughts on the project and go over the technical details.

Doug, nice summary! I have a question about Item Management practices when work with Vault /PLM 360 sync tools. As I understand, Items and BOM will be always synchronized "one-way" like you explain here -->

===
Revision History - When an item is synchronized, all revisions get synchronized.  So you can view the item history in PLM 360 just like you can in Vault.

BOM - The entire BOM is synchronized, not just a single item.  Again, the result is an identical data in Vault and PLM 360.
===

So, where /how do you suggest to manage Item Masters? Is it Vault of PLM 360? Another question is about multiple Bill of Materials? How do you recommend to manage multiple BOMs when you're synching BOM all the time from Vault? Let say I want to have EBOM/MBOM/PurchaseBOM/AssemblyBOM/AsBuiltBOM. I assume every BOM will seat in a separate Workspace, correct? In that case, how should I synchronize BOM from Vault?

Thanks, Oleg

With the first version of PLM sync, Vault is the Item Master but you can sync different 'Item Searches' to different workspaces if you like.

What you are asking is not currently supported.  The intent of the sync tool is to replicate the Vault data in PLM 360.  Since Vault doesn't have a built-in concept of different BOM types, the synced data doesn't have that concept either.  So syncing data to multiple PLM workspaces isn't going to help because the data will be identical.

The intent for R1 of the sync tool is that the item data should be read-only in PLM 360.  So I don't recommend trying to alter the BOM once it gets to PLM 360.

In future releases, we will adding more functionality, but I can't go into the specifics right now.  You bring up good points to keep in mind.  Thanks.

<p>Welcome to part 2 of my articles on custom objects.&#0160; In <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2012/04/vault-is-insanely-configurable-too.html">part 1</a>, I went over the UI features.&#0160; Now I will go over the API features, which is where the real fun begins.&#0160; If you want some sample code, have a look at my <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2012/04/discussion-thread-app.html">Discussion Thread app</a>.&#0160; But first... terminology.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #5acb04;" />
<p><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">Terminology</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Custom Object and Custom Entity</strong></p>
<p>These are the exact same things.&#0160; Custom Object is the name we use in the UI.&#0160; Custom Entity is the name we use in the API.</p>
<p><strong>Entity Class and Custom Entity Definition</strong></p>
<p>I’ve talked before about <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2011/09/entities-and-behaviors.html">entities</a>.&#0160; As you probably guessed, custom entities are entities.&#0160; What can be confusing is that all custom entities belong to the same Entity Class, which has “CUSTENT” as the ID value.&#0160;</p>
<p>Custom Entity Definitions can be considered a sub-type of CUSTENT.&#0160; So if I create custom entity definitions called “Foo” and “Bar”, they are both part of the CUSTENT entity class.&#0160;</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2012/CustomEntities/SubTypes.png" /></p>
<p>This distinction is important because a lot of things operate on the CUSTENT level.&#0160; For example, FindCustomEntitiesBySearchConditions will search across custom entities of all sub-types.&#0160; If you want to scope the search to a specific sub-type, you can do that with a search condition.</p>
<p>Permissions is another thing that operates on the CUSTENT level.&#0160; If a user has the Custom Object Editor (Level 2) role, it applies to all custom entity sub-types.&#0160; If you want each sub-type to have their own permissions, you can use the ACL settings.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #5acb04;" />
<p><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">API Features</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Custom Commands      <br /></strong>Your custom commands in Vault Explorer can be bound to specific custom entity sub types.&#0160; That way the command is only visible when an object of your custom object sub-type is selected.&#0160; Also, you can add commands to the context menu for your sub types.</p>
<p>To make use of this feature, create custom commands just like normal.&#0160; The only difference is that you set the navigation type to a new SelectionTypeId which points to your sub-type.</p>
<p><strong>Custom Tabs      <br /></strong>You can define your own Vault Explorer tabs which only show up when your custom entity sub-type is selected.&#0160; You also have the option of hiding the default tabs.</p>
<p>Just like with custom commands, you create a new SelectionTypeId to hook the tab to your sub-type.</p>
<p><strong>New and Delete Override      <br /></strong>You can take over the New and Delete commands in Vault Explorer so that your code gets called instead of the default.&#0160; The IExtension interface has a new method, CustomEntityHandlers.&#0160; Pass back a new CustomEntityHandler, which has New and Delete events that you can hook to.</p>
<p><strong>Update Lifecycle State - Web Service Command Event      <br /></strong>Through the CustomEntityService, you can hook to the GetRestrictions, Pre and Post events whenever a custom entity changes lifecycle state.&#0160; These hooks apply to all CUSTENT state changes regardless of sub-type.</p>
<p><strong>Update Lifecycle State - Lifecycle Event Job      <br /></strong>Through the Lifecycle Event Editor you can configure the server to fire jobs when custom entities change lifecycle states.&#0160; These jobs fire on sepecific state transitions regarless of entity type or sub-type.</p>

<p>File this post under: “Things that Doug should have put in the SDK documentation.”    <br />I’m not sure how this information was omitted, but I apologize.</p>
<p>Anyway, when jobs are created from a lifecycle state change, the job will have a specific set of parameters depending on the entity type.&#0160; Here is the list of parameters.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #ff5a00;" />
<p><strong>Vault 2012</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Files       
<ul>
<li>FileId - The ID of the updated file. </li>
<li>LifeCyleTransitionId (<em>sic</em>) - The ID of the lifecycle transition that the file just went through. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Items       
<ul>
<li>ItemId - The ID of the updated item. </li>
<li>FromStateId - The state that the item started in. </li>
<li>ToStateId - The state that the item ended in. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Change Orders       
<ul>
<li>ChangeOrderId - The ID of the updated change order. </li>
<li>FromStateId - The state that the change order started in. </li>
<li>ToStateId - The state that the change order ended in. </li>
<li>ActivityId - The activity defining the transition. </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #ff5a00;" />
<p><strong>Vault 2013</strong></p>
<p>The main change here is that the file lifecycle engine in 2012 has been expanded to other entity types.&#0160; So file-specific parameters have been changed to the more generic entity concept.</p>
<ul>
<li>Files, Folders and Custom Entities       
<ul>
<li>EntityId - The ID of the updated file, folder or custom entity. </li>
<li>EntityClassId - They type of entity that was updated. </li>
<li>LifeCycleTransitionId - The ID of the lifecycle transition that the file just went through. </li>
<li>LifeCyleTransitionId <strong>[deprecated]</strong> - Use Life<strong>Cycle</strong>TransitionId instead. </li>
<li>FileId <strong>[deprecated]</strong> - Use EntityId instead. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Items       
<ul>
<li>ItemId - The ID of the updated item. </li>
<li>FromStateId - The state that the item started in. </li>
<li>ToStateId - The state that the item ended in. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Change Orders       
<ul>
<li>ChangeOrderId - The ID of the updated change order. </li>
<li>FromStateId - The state that the change order started in. </li>
<li>ToStateId - The state that the change order ended in. </li>
<li>ActivityId - The activity defining the transition. </li>

In case of Items, additional you will have UpdateItemLifeCycleStateCommandEventArgs.ApplyToChildren  with True or False. The event fired for top-level items only and all components must be handled by your own code.

You are thinking of the client-side event hooks on ItemService.  There is another mechanism where the server will add jobs to the queue when items move through specified lifecycle states.  The parameters on these jobs are different than with the client-side events.

Part 5 in my webinar series, compares the different event types.  <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2012/02/6-hours-of-video-on-the-vault-api.html">http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2012/02/6-hours-of-video-on-the-vault-api.html</a>

<p>This scenario should be familiar if you have used the Vault API.&#0160; Your code relies on a specific configuration which you need to look up in your code.&#0160; For example, you have a UDP and your code needs to look up the ProdDef object.&#0160; How do you do it?&#0160; What piece of information do you use?</p>
<p>Let’s start with the completely wrong answer.&#0160; The <strong>ID</strong> value should not be used.&#0160; It’s not consistent between Vaults, you don’t know the value ahead of time, and the value may change when you migrate to the next Vault release.</p>
<p>The <strong>Display Name</strong> is usable in certain cases, but is not bullet proof.&#0160; The main problem is that the display name can be changed through the Vault settings.&#0160; If your app is specific to a single Vault installation, then you can sometimes get away with this approach.&#0160; If you are developing something for a mass market, then you can’t depend on the display name.</p>
<p><strong>System Name</strong> is the most solid thing to use.&#0160; Once this value is set, it can’t be changed.&#0160; The Vault admins can change the display name all they want, the system name will not change.&#0160;</p>
<p>In Vault 2012 and earlier, the server would create the system name for you using a randomly generated GUID.&#0160; So there is no way you could know that value when you are writing your code.</p>
<p>In Vault 2013, we updated most of the Add functions so that you pass in the system name.&#0160; This way, you can know ahead of time what the system name is.&#0160; You can store that value in you code and be secure in the knowledge that it will locate the correct object.</p>
<p>When calling an Add function, you can’t set the system name to be whatever you want.&#0160; It must be a GUID in the format (lower case) xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx.&#0160; If you have a .Net Guid object, you can just call ToString(“D”) to get that string.&#0160; Even though your system name will not be human readable, but it will be reliable.&#0160; And you are safe from naming collisions (as long as people don’t just cut and paste code from the sample apps on your blog).</p>
<p>Another caveat to this architecture is that you need to add the object through the API.&#0160; If you do it through the UI, then the client will give it a random system name.</p>

Hi,

Do WebServices.File have a SysName equivalent? I can only see Id.

System names are mainly for the type of stuff you see in the Vault Settings like property definitions and categories.

Files do not have system names, and there is currently no equivalent concept.

<p>It looks like <a href="http://underthehood-autodesk.typepad.com/" target="_blank">Brian Schanen</a> is only blogging about PLM 360.&#0160; So that leaves it to me to explain the Custom Entity feature in Vault Professional 2013.&#0160; It’s probably better this way.&#0160; Although you can create Custom Entities without API programming, it’s like setting off fireworks in the daytime.&#0160; You just don’t get the full effect.</p>
<p>I don’t think I’ll be able to cover everything in just one article, so I’ll just focus on the UI aspects for today.&#0160; In the coming weeks, I’ll dig deeper into the API details.&#0160; And if your nose is detecting a nice meaty aroma, that’s the smell of a sample app coming soon.</p>
<p>You can manage your custom entities through the Vault Settings dialog.&#0160; You may notice that there is a new tab for Custom Objects. (NOTE: custom entities are called “custom objects” in the UI).&#0160; This tab is mostly empty.&#0160; The only thing you can do is click the Configure button, which lets you manage the custom entity definitions.&#0160; You can think of a custom entity definition as a class definition in .NET or a table definition in SQL.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2012/CustomEntities/ConfigureCustomObjectDefs.png" /></p>
<p>If you create a new definition, you’ll see that there are various fields to set.&#0160; There the display name and plural display name determines how the objects will be shown to the user.&#0160; The security defines the default ACL for new objects.&#0160; The icon is the image that will get displayed next to your objects.&#0160; This is an .ico file, so you can define multiple sizes.&#0160; We recommend 16x16 , 32x32, 64x64, or 128x128.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2012/CustomEntities/CustomObjectDef.png" /></p>
<p>After a custom object definition is created, you need to restart Vault Explorer to see it properly.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2012/CustomEntities/Ve1.png" /></p>
<p>Our custom entities get their own section in Vault Explorer.&#0160; If we go to one of these sections and create a new object, you will see the default New behavior, which is pretty basic.&#0160; All you can set is the name for the entity.&#0160; In another post, I’ll show you how to override this dialog.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2012/CustomEntities/NewFoo.png" /></p>
<p>Now we have our object, but I’m guessing you are going to want to set more than just the name.&#0160; To configure things like properties, category, you need to go to the property and category sections of Vault Settings.&#0160; You will see that Custom Object capability has been added to these settings.&#0160; Through the category configuration you can set things like property definitions and lifecycle.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2012/CustomEntities/UDP.png" /></p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2012/CustomEntities/CatConfig.png" /></p>
<p>It’s also a good idea to set up a rule to move your custom objects to their own category upon creation.&#0160;</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2012/CustomEntities/CatRules.png" /></p>
<p>The last thing I want to go over is the default tabs.&#0160; The Contents tab works like the Uses tab for files; it shows the children entities.&#0160; The Were Used tab works the same way but it identifies parents.&#0160; To set these relationships you use the Link feature.&#0160; Just copy an entity and “Paste as Link” into the Contents tab of your custom entity.&#0160; You can link your custom object to and from all the major entity types (files, folders, items, change orders and custom entities).</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2012/CustomEntities/Ve2.png" /></p>
<p>Hopefully you are starting to see the possibilities, and I’ve only gone over the standard UI behavior.&#0160; The real fun begins when we get into the API features in <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2012/05/vault-is-insanely-configurable-too-2.html" target="_self">part 2</a>.</p>

EXCERPT:
It looks like Brian Schanen is only blogging about PLM 360.  So that leaves it to me to explain the Custom Entity feature in Vault Professional 2013.  It’s probably better this way.  Although you can create Custom Entities without API programming, it’s like setting off fireworks in the daytime.  You just don’t get the full effect.

I don’t think I’ll be able to cover everything in just one article, so I’ll just focus on the UI aspects for today.  In the coming weeks, I’ll dig deeper into the API details.  And if your nose is detecting a nice meaty aroma, that’s the smell of a sample app coming soon.

Hi,

I am looking for some help with the Vault 2014 API for customizing objects. I have a custom object created. I want to add a property definition like "Name". 
I am looking at how I might implement this from the API? I can use addCustomEntity() to add in my Custom object in this case it's DisplayName is "TestObject". Can I add a property instance to this from a UI control? Can I achieve this using the PropertyService API, will this work with my existing custom entity? Apologies, if I have got the terminology incorrect. I am new to the Vault API.  
I am programming this in C#.

Many thanks,
Barry

Hi,

I am looking for some help with Vault 2014 API for custom objects. What I am trying to achieve is that, I have created a custom object in C# and I would like to add the property instance from a windows form where the user can input a value this then is displayed under the property definition sysname column heading for that custom object. Can I achieve this using PropInst.val() call? Any help you be most appreciated.

Use PropertyService.AddPropertyDefinition to create a new property. Ex. FirstName

Use CustomEntityService.UpdateCustomEntityProperties to set the property value on a custom object.  Ex. FirstName="John"

My Discussion Thread app has code example of creating Custom Object definition, property definitions, categories, etc. through code.

You can also download the materials from an AU class I presented last year:  CP1962: Programming Custom Objects with the Autodesk Vault API.

Hi Doug,
I've noticed that the UpdateCustomEntityProperties method has been removed for 2016, according to the Vault SDK help, and according to the errors showing up in my code.
Is there an alternative method to change custom entity properties?
The line of code that used to work is this:
<b>WSManager.CustomEntityService.UpdateCustomEntityProperties(New Long() {CT.Id}, New Long() {DateProp.PropDefId}, New Object() {todaystring})</b>
Thanks

<p>The only part I don’t like about a new release is updating my sample apps.&#0160; Just like with last year, I don’t have time to update all my apps.&#0160; I’m just going to focus on the ones that are important to me.&#0160;</p>
<p>vLogic looks like a good place to start, even though I just built <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2012/01/vlogic.html" target="_blank">the 2012 version</a> a couple months ago.&#0160; It’s one of those apps that I immediately wanted to add features to right after I posted it.&#0160;</p>
<p><strong><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2012/vLogic/menu.png" /></strong></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #013181;" />
<p><strong>New for Vault 2013:&#0160; </strong></p>
<p><strong>Event support - </strong>vLogic scripts now come in two flavors.&#0160; <strong>Command scripts</strong> are invoked by the user when they click on the menu command.&#0160; <strong>Event scripts</strong> are invoked automatically when actions take place.&#0160; These scripts hook right into the web service command events, so you can run scripts during a checkout, add folder, delete item, and so on.&#0160; I also put in hooks for the OnLogOn and OnLogOut event in Vault Explorer.</p>
<p>There is a naming convention to determine which .ps1 files hook to which events.&#0160; See readme for more details.&#0160; Note, the example event scripts are inactive after installation.&#0160; You need to remove the ‘_’ prefix and restart Vault Explorer for those scripts to run.</p>
<p><strong>Easier navigation</strong> - Hold down the SHIFT key when running the “Create New Command” menu item and an explorer window will open to the vLogic folder.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #013181;" />
<p><strong>vLogic Features:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>No Visual Studio required to write custom commands and event handlers. </li>
<li>No compile step. </li>
<li>No deploy step. </li>
<li>Commands can be updated without having to exit Vault Explorer. </li>
<li>Easy to share scripts or modify scripts from others. </li>
</ul>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #013181;" />
<p><strong>Requirements:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Vault Workgroup/Collaboration/Professional 2013 </li>
<li>Windows PowerShell (should already be part of your OS) </li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/Apps/vLogic/vLogic-2.0.1.0-bin.zip">Click here to download the application</a> <br /><a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/Apps/vLogic/vLogic-2.0.1.0-src.zip">Click here to download the source code</a></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #013181;" />
<p><strong>Upgrading from vLogic 2012:</strong></p>
<p>Your old scripts need to move to the “%ProgramData%\Autodesk\<strong>Vault 2013</strong>\Extensions\vLogic\<strong>command scripts”</strong> folder.&#0160; Some API functions have changed in 2013.&#0160; See the Vault 2013 SDK documentation for a list of all changed functions.&#0160; If the parameters are wrong on an API function, it will result in a runtime error.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #013181;" />
<p><strong>To use:</strong></p>
<p>Run the install and start Vault Explorer.</p>
<p>Under the Tools menu is the vLogic menu.&#0160; This is where you can run existing scripts or create new scripts.    <br />To create a new command script, select Create New Command from the vLogic menu.&#0160; After giving your script a name, you will have to re-start Vault Explorer.&#0160; When the program re-starts, your command should show up in the vLogic menu.</p>
<p>To edit a script, hold the shift key and click on the command.&#0160; The PowerShell ISE should pop up, allowing you to edit the script while Vault Explorer is running.&#0160; When you are done with your changes, save the file in the editor.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2012/vLogic/editor.png" /></p>
<p>To run a script, run the command from the vLogic menu.</p>
<p>To delete a script, go to %ProgramData%\Autodesk\Vault 2013\Extensions\vLogic\[script folder] and remove the .ps1 file.&#0160; You can also add commands by putting .ps1 files into the appropriate folder.</p>

Hi Doug,
I've honestly tried. Almost a week without any visible progress :(
IMHO to give some boost to the topic several "snippets" for admin-daily-tasks need to be shared.
Could you provide at least 3 for:
- Searching objects (files, items etc) by criteries.
- Editing Items (change ItemNumber, fill UDP etc).
- Editing ECOs (ex. change routing).
Thank in advance.

In the section "To use:" where the post says "you will have to re-start Vault Explorer" means you need to restart Vault and log out of Inventor (and presumably any other logged in client). I was confused that I could not see the newly created Command until I logged out of Vault from Inventor and restarted Vault Client.

No.  "Vault Explorer" is the name of the Vault client application.  vLogic only runs in Vault Explorer, so that's the only thing to restart.  
You do not need to restart Inventor.

If you get an app from the store, the Autodesk App Manager will tell you if that app ever gets out-of-date.  However, I don't see anything on the site where you can get alerts for new apps.

We have users who want to take advatage of the new grid options in the plug in browsers, but we cant upgrade our server just yet. So can we have a scenario of Vault Pro 2012 server, Inventor/AutoCAD 2012, Vault Professional Client 2013?

I don't think that the Vault 2013 client will install the Inventor 2012 plug-in.
However, the Vault clients can be installed side-by-side.  So you can install both the Vault 2012 and 2013 clients.

Hi Doug,
we had some issues with Vault Client 2012 (Red cross on document grid with Domain Users and Domain Admin). Since we couldn't manage the problem, we planned deploy Vault 2013, but we will remain on Inventor 2012. We are testing the use of Inventor Plug-in (2012) with Vault Server 2013. We have some minor issue: In Inventor the button Launch Vault starts Vault 2012, in dialog boxes like Open etc. the links showed belongs to Vault 2012 and not Vault 2013.
Any suggestion?

Sorry, I don't have any ideas.  The way it works is that Inventor 2012 has no knowledge of Vault 2013.  For all intents and purposes, Inventor still thinks it's working with Vault 2012.

So I'm not at all surprised that Inventor 2012 launches the Vault 2012 client.

Is it also possible to install Inventor 2013 and Vault 2013 client side-by-side with Inventor 2011 and Vault 2011 Client.
We want to setup a test server for Vault 2013 and need to work with 2011 for a while.

I know that Vault 2011 and Vault 2013 can be installed side-by side.  I'm not sure about Inventor though.  You will need to test that out yourself.

Hi Doug,

I have an instance of Inventor 2012 and Vault 2013 server. Ererything works fine but when customer wants to transfer custon CC libraries he got message "wrong version of the server". Is there any way to make this transfer or it's impossile thus there are different versions of software?

My guess is that Content Center does not support this type of compatibility.  But you will need to check with the Inventor team to confirm.

Hi Doug
P&ID 2014 Vault Vault 2013 plugin, and I think through the c # Code access to P&ID 2014 Vault plugin login connection.
I see <a href="http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/Vault-Customization/Get-Securityheader-from-Vault-Login-in-AutoCAD/td-p/3773017">http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/Vault-Customization/Get-Securityheader-from-Vault-Login-in-AutoCAD/td-p/3773017</a>   
Download AutoCAD_Vault_2014_get_Connection In 2014 can be successful,but In P&ID 2014 can't be successful.
Can you give me some help.Thank you very much.

Offhand, I don't have an answer for you.  Each CAD plug-in is different.  So P&ID might not have a way for you to get that connection.

Officially, the API does not support getting the active connection in a CAD plug-in.  

I suggest posting this question to the Vault Customization group to see if somebody else knows more about Vault on P&ID.

BODY:
<p><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/Announcements3.png" /></p>
<p>We’ve officially released the Vault 2013 line of products, so I can now talk about the new API features.&#0160; This has been another good release for the API, some very nice stuff has been added for you to do interesting things with.&#0160; I’ll also list some of the more noticeable changes you will run into if you are coming from the Vault 2012 API.</p>
<p>In the coming weeks, I’ll be elaborating on most of these features, but for now I’ll just give you a high level view of the new API.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #ff0000;" />
<p><strong>New Feature:&#0160; Custom Entities      <br /></strong>Vault Professional allows you do define your own entity types.&#0160; You are no longer forced to use Files, Folders, Items and Change Orders for all your data.&#0160; Custom entities support properties, categories, ACL security, links and lifecycles (the same engine that files use).&#0160; The only behavior you might miss is versions and revisions.</p>
<p>Through the API you can create custom commands, custom tabs, custom new and delete behavior, and lifecycle events for you custom entity types.</p>
<p><strong>New Feature:&#0160; API Compatibility      <br /></strong>Vault Server 2013 contains two sets of web services.&#0160; Once set is the new 2013 services, but the 2012 services are still there too.&#0160; This means that 2012 clients will still work with the 2013 server.&#0160; No update required.</p>
<p>Note:&#0160; Compatibility does not apply to plug-ins such as custom commands, job handlers and event hooks.</p>
<p><strong>New Feature:&#0160; Job Processor API      <br /></strong>The IJobHandler interface has some new additions.&#0160; You can now run code during startup and shutdown.&#0160; You also have hooks for sleep, which is right before Job Processor goes idle, and wake, which is right after the idle period is over.</p>
<p>Job Processor itself has some enhancements.&#0160; It can use Windows credentials for login (however a Vault license is still consumed).&#0160; There are also new command line options for Job Processor so you can do service related operations, such as pause, resume and stop.</p>
<p><strong>New Feature:&#0160; Auto Ownership Transfer      <br /></strong>Transferring entities in a replicated environment just got much easier.&#0160; First transfers usually happen instantly instead of requiring you to wait for a few minutes.&#0160; Also the WebServiceManager will automatically transfer ownership for you attempt to edit an entity that is owned by another workgroup.&#0160;</p>
<p><strong>New Feature:&#0160; Impersonation      <br /></strong>If your program is logged in as an administrator, it can switch its credentials to that of another user.&#0160; This is useful for utilities that edit Vault data, but you want it to preserve the user that originally created the data.</p>
<p><strong>Change:&#0160; .NET 4.0      <br /></strong>All the SDK DLLs have been moved over to .NET 4.0.&#0160; Since 4.0 uses a new CLR, you can’t use projects that are 3.5 or earlier.&#0160; All SDK samples have been updated to Visual Studio 2010.</p>
<p><strong>Change:&#0160; Strong named assemblies      <br /></strong>All SDK DLLs now have a strong name.&#0160; It’s recommended you strong name your project if possible.</p>
<p><strong>Change:&#0160; Autodesk.Connectivity.WebServicesTools.dll has been removed.      <br /></strong>All the code has been moved into Autodesk.Connectivity.WebServices.dll.&#0160; So no code change is needed, you just have one less assembly to link to and deploy.&#0160; The WebServicesTools namespace has not changed.</p>
<p><strong>Change:&#0160; System Name control      <br /></strong>You can now define the system name for objects created through the API.&#0160; This gives you a reliable string that you can use to look up things like property definitions and categories.</p>
<p><strong>Change:&#0160; Lifecycle Service      <br /></strong>The code for managing file lifecycles has been moved to the new lifecycle service.&#0160; The functions have been genericized to use entities instead of files. This change was done to support lifecycles on Folders and Custom Entities.</p>
<p><strong>Change:&#0160; byte [] has been changed to ByteArray      <br /></strong>Web service functions have been updated to transfer a ByteArray object in most cases where byte [] was used, for example, upload and download.&#0160; This change was done to support the compression feature.</p>
<p>By default, compression is not used.&#0160; However the option is there to use LZ4 compression when transferring binary data.</p>

Are you talking about the feature where you create a link to a file that lives in another folder?  No, we do not have events for links.

Hi Doug, long time no see,

There is a new parameter in the api command for file checkout : 'DownloadOptions'. Can your provide an example for the 'DownloadPart' (download in chunks) method ? Is it used in combination with the DownLoadFileInParts api method ?
Does this mean that checkout will generate error 1101 (DownloadFileSizeExceedsServerLimit) for large files as from version 2013 ? I experience this error since the upgrade to 2013, never have seen this message before on checkout.

Thanks in advance

Yes, you understanding is correct.  If you want to checkout a large file and download in the same call, you use the DownloadPart option.  The Checkout function will then give you the first part.  Call DownloadFilePart to get the rest of the file.

The SDK documentation for DownloadFilePart shows some sample code, but only for DownloadFilePart alone.  I don't have an example of Checkout + DownloadFilePart.   

Personally, I checkout and download as separate calls.  Checkout and Download are slow operations, so you don't gain much performance by combining them into one API call.

Hi Doug,

I have a Vault Professional 2014 API question that I hope you can help me out with?
I have a custom object created that allows me to create a identification number, somewhat like when a new item is created. What I would like to achieve is using the Vault API that will allow me to create this unique number that is associated with other file properties that will match up with this unique number. I am looking at the custom entity API would this API allow me to achieve this?
I have a DECO app that is currently used for to do this to create a new reference number. I would like to replicate this using the Vault API.

I look forward to your reply.
Many thanks,
Barry

<p><strong>Error 1:</strong>&#0160; There should be a check to see if userid is valid.&#0160; In the case of an anonymous connection, userid will be 0.&#0160; All valid User IDs are greater than 0.</p>
<p><strong>Error 2:</strong>&#0160; GetRolesByUserId will fail unless the user is logged in as an administrator.</p>
<p><strong>Error 3:</strong>&#0160; For non-English installs, the role name will probably not be “Administrator”.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #ff5a00;" />
<p>I’ll be the first to admit that correct code is not very elegant.&#0160; The core Vault framework doesn’t really have an administrator concept.&#0160; Instead it just understands that users have groups of permissions.&#0160; “Administrator” is a higher level concept, and is a collection of almost every permission.</p>
<p>So the permission set is what we need to look at, and we do that with GetPermissionsByUserId.&#0160; Non-admins can call this function as long as they are calling it for their own user ID.&#0160; Once we get the permission set, we check for a permission that only the admin group has.&#0160; Permission IDs don’t change between vaults, so this is one of the few cases where it’s OK hard-code an ID.</p>
<p>Here is the correct code:</p>

BODY:
<p><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/TipsAndTricks3.png" /></p>
<p>The question has come up a couple of times on how to associate Property Definitions with a Category.&#0160; So I thought I would write up the code and post it here.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2012/CategoryProperties/admindialog_scaled.png" /></p>
<p>The code is a bit hard to follow unless you understand a few things about Categories.&#0160; A Category is a <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2011/09/entities-and-behaviors.html" target="_blank">behavior</a> that is a container for other behaviors.&#0160; Things like property definitions, lifecycles and revision schemes can be thought of as living inside a category or set of categories.&#0160; So in the case of properties, we are adding a new property definition to a Category’s collection of behaviors.&#0160; So a lot of the code deals with Behavior objects, which is an abstract representation of our property definition.&#0160; The good news is that the code below can easily be re-purposed to associate revisions and lifecycles to a Category.</p>
<p>In this example code, I’m going to take a UDP I created, MyProp, and associate it to the Engineering category.</p>

Hi,
it would like to have two properties working on this way in data card:
if in the property 1 I select from list the item A -> in the property 2 I can only select B, C or D from list
or
if in the property 1 I select from list the item X -> in the property 2 I can only select Y, W or Z from list
I mean category and sub category or if you prefer family and sub family
category A -> sub category B,C,D
category X -> sub category Y,W,Z
e.g.
category A = hydraulics
sub category B= pipe
sub category C=valve
sub category D=hose
 
Any help will be appreciated.

Hi,
in the vault professional 2013 is it possible to have some properties cross referenced between project and files?
I have some files linked a different project.
For example the property X of the linked file 1 has the value AA in project AAA but the value BB in the project BBB.
Thanks

There is a way to put meta-data on a Link.  
AddLink() let's you create a Link, and the last parameter is for meta-data.  You can read this data back with GetMetaOnLinks().  Both functions are in the document service.

This is an API only feature.  You can't see this data through the default Vault Clients.  So you would need to write plug-ins or apps to get and set this data.

<p>For a while, I’ve been looking for a good way to detect if <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2010/03/file-transfer-as-binary-data.html" target="_blank">binary transfer</a> is set up properly for a Vault app.&#0160; I’ve finally found that way, and its name is <a href="http://fiddler2.com/fiddler2/" target="_blank">Fiddler</a>.</p>
<p>If you don’t know what Fiddler is, it’s a tool that lets you monitor HTTP traffic on your computer.&#0160; It’s the type of utility that has millions of uses, but I’ll be focusing only on using it to help with Vault programming.&#0160; Since Vault uses web services for server communication, you can use Fiddler to verify that your files are transferring properly.</p>
<p>One of the aspects of the Vault API is that you need to configure things very specifically in order to get files to transfer in a binary mode.&#0160; If you get a step wrong, then files get transferred as text.&#0160;&#0160; But your app still works, so it’s a tricky problem to locate.&#0160; I’ll show you how to use Fiddler to verify the binary transfer.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #ff5a00;" />
<p>Steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Install <a href="http://fiddler2.com/fiddler2/" target="_blank">Fiddler</a>. </li>
<li>Open Fiddler. </li>
<li>Run your app.&#0160; Make sure to have a real computer name as the Vault server; do not use “localhost” or “127.0.0.1”. </li>
<li>Upload or download a file.&#0160; The size of the file does not matter, but I suggest a binary file, such as an image. </li>
<li>In Fiddler, locate the entry that corresponds to the API call that performed the file transfer.&#0160; <ol>
<li>The left pane, shows all the HTTP requests.&#0160; Vault API calls will show the URL of the web service. </li>
<li>The right top pane shows the outgoing request.&#0160; For Vault API calls, this has the raw SOAP data, including the function name and parameter set. </li>
<li>The bottom right pane shows the incoming response.&#0160; For Vault API calls, this has the raw SOAP data, this has the function name and return values. </li>
<li>You can use either pane on the right to find the function name.&#0160; It’s best to use the Text View and scroll to the bottom of the pane.&#0160; The element directly inside &lt;soap:Body&gt; is the function name. </li>
</ol> </li>
<li>If you are doing an upload, you want to check the outgoing pane at the right-top.&#0160; If you are doing a download, you want to check the incoming pane at the right-bottom. </li>
<li>If you configured things correctly, there should be a section at the bottom indicating a MIME attachment.&#0160; There may also be a gibberish representation of the binary data.      <br />If you configured things incorrectly, there will be no MIME attachment.&#0160; The file data will show as a large text string in a function parameter or return value. </li>
</ol> 
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #ff5a00;" />

<p>In case you missed the news, we have officially launched our new PLM product.&#0160; Autodesk is now a PLM company!&#0160; It was an event so awesome that we had to add an extra day to February.</p>

I might show a demo of Revit working with Vault, but that's the extent of it.

It's mostly going to be introductory API stuff.  With the AEC audience, I'm not going to assume everybody knows what Vault is.

Dear Doug

I’ve watched your recent webinar “on-line” and must admit – the event was very helpful. Thanks.
Now I’ve figured out what our company need to have improved in Vault first of all.

We definitely need to use several CO routings, and as soon as particular routing could be set to new CO only on Creation by Change Requestor and can’t be switched later by others we need to force this action otherwise half of COs would be assigned to wrong (default) routing.

Could you recommend where to start from in our case?
Hide “Create new CO” command in client and replace it with custom «a bit modified» one?

Hiding the New CO command is a good place to start.  I'm not sure if it will work though.  The New commands have special behavior in the File menu and toolbar.  Also there are many ways to create a new CO, like from the Item context menu.

I don't think the event framework will help you.  Once the CO is created, only certain people can change the routing.

Another option is to create checker/fixer routines to handle incorrect COs.  That way the Vault admin has a easy way to fix things if something has incorrect data.

Doug, thanks for the answer.
Now I feel like sharing yor doubt regarding my initial idea.
Could you extend a bit the option you've mentioned ?
You mean that something could alarm vault admin every time somebody saves CO with "Default" routing choosen (and/or block its further submitting), right? 
And then vault admin would contact change requestor and help him to choose the correct routing?

There are many ways to go with this detector utility.  Here are some suggestions:

- It could be a scheduled Windows task or service that runs once a day and emails the admin and CO creator if there are any problems.

- It could be a Vault Explorer command that the administrator runs explicitly.  vLogic could be used to write this command.

Hi Doug,

I was curious about a comment you made in Part 1 @ 39:18, regarding Vault sign-in as "read-only".  Is this option available only through the Vault API, or is there a setting from within the Vault client to accomplish this??

Thanks!

From the Vault Explorer client, there is no read-only option.  You always log in with read/write access.
Through the web client, there is an option on for read only access.

Hi Doug,

Thanks for this. I am trying to use the
GetLatestFileAssociationsByMasterIds method to get the revision lable of the first chield.
This is going great. However if more children are present it seems to be random which chield it takes the revision from.

My problem is that I can only chose from all, attachments, dependencies or none.

Is there some way to specify that I need the revision from the 1st chield?

Hope you can help me out.

No. Vault doesn't order the attachments or dependencies.  So there is no guarantee on which child is the "first".
The recommended approach is to cycle through the list to find the child you want.

No.  If you have the file checked out, then JobProcessor can't check out the file.  The job will fail, but it won't affect your Inventor session.

It sounds like Job Processor is running on an engineer's machine.  If that is the case, then yes, you should run it after the user goes home.

The design intent of Job Processor is to run on a dedicated server machine.  That way it can perform large operations 24 hours a day without impacting performance.

There are several toolbars you can add your command to.  When you set the Location property on your CommandSite, choose a value with the word "Toolbar" at then end.

To display your command as an icon, set ToolbarPaintStyle to Glyph on your CommandItem you will also need to set the Image property too.  A few more details on command icons can be found at <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2010/03/command-icons.html">http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2010/03/command-icons.html</a>

<li>Commands can be updated without having to exit Vault Explorer. </li>
<li>Easy to share scripts or modify scripts from others. </li>
</ul>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #013181;" />
<p><strong>Requirements:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Vault Workgroup/Collaboration/Professional 2012 </li>
<li>Windows PowerShell (should already be part of your OS) </li>
</ul>

<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #013181;" />
<p><strong>To use:</strong></p>
<p>Run the install and start Vault Explorer.&#0160;</p>
<p>Under the Tools menu is the vLogic menu.&#0160; This is where you can run existing scripts or create new scripts.    <br />&#0160; <br />To create a new script, select Create New Command from the vLogic menu.&#0160; After giving your script a name, you will have to re-start Vault Explorer.&#0160; When the program re-starts, your command should show up in the vLogic menu.&#0160;</p>
<p>To edit a script, hold the shift key and click on the command.&#0160; The PowerShell ISE should pop up, allowing you to edit the script while Vault Explorer is running.&#0160; When you are done with your changes, save the file in the editor.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2012/vLogic/editor.png" /></p>
<p>To run a script, run the command from the vLogic menu.</p>
<p>To delete a script, go to %ProgramData%\Autodesk\Vault 2012\Extensions\vLogic and remove the .ps1 file.&#0160; You can also add commands by putting .ps1 files in this folder.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #013181;" />
<p>There are some downsides to vLogic.&#0160; If you are not familiar with PowerShell, then it’s basically a new language that you have to learn.&#0160; If you have complex operations or UI, then you are better off using Visual Studio.&#0160; As this moment, I have no good story for debugging a vLogic script.&#0160;</p>
<p>This is just my first pass at adding scripting to Vault.&#0160; There is lots of room for improvement for future releases.</p>

EXCERPT:
As promised, I came up with something for those of you who want to customize Vault through the use of scripts.  I decided to use PowerShell as the scripting engine since it has a lot of tools ready-to-use for this sort of thing.  If you are not familiar with PowerShell, you can find tons of information on the internet, including the Microsoft web site.

That's pretty cool Doug, keep up the good work!

Question: I realise it's very early days for this add in but are you planning on creating a library of common commands/samples for use with vLogic - in the same way that Inventor does within iLogic?

:)

I don't have any plans at the moment.  I'm going to wait and see how things evolve.  Having a script library is a good idea.  My hope is that a bunch of people start writing scripts and trading them online.  Then I can just gather up the good ones into a power pack or something.

<p>Put on your Ramones T-shirt and get out your beige box because it’s hacker time.&#0160; Not real hacking, of course, since I work for Autodesk.&#0160; This is more of a “programmer for a major software corporation posting to a blog” style of hacking.</p>
<p>Anyway, the goal is to display up a better message when our programs run across an error from Vault.&#0160; For example, instead of “303” as the error message, I’ll show you how to display “PermissionDenied” or whatever else you want.</p>
<p>There are over 800 error codes that the Vault server might return, and they always take the form of a number.&#0160; We want to display something human readable and we don’t want to spend all day typing.</p>
<p>Here are the hax0r tools you will need:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Vault SDK </li>
<li>Microsoft Excel </li>
<li>Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 </li>
</ul>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #ff5a00;" />
<p><strong>Step 1:&#0160; Get the error codes</strong></p>
<p>You can find the list of error codes in the SDK documentation.&#0160; Go to the “Error Codes – Server” page has our list.&#0160; It has all the codes, and it has text names of the codes.&#0160;</p>
<p>Right click on the page and click on “View Source.”&#0160; This will pop up the raw HTML.&#0160; Save the text as an HTML file.&#0160; Now we have the codes out of the CHM.&#0160; The codes are in table form, which is good, but we need to do more with this data.&#0160; So let’s fire up a spreadsheet program.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2012/BetterErrorMessages/CHM.png" /></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #ff5a00;" />
<p><strong>Step 2: Edit in Excel</strong></p>
<p>Open the HTML file in Excel, which will take the error code table and put it in spreadsheet format.&#0160; Feel free to delete everything outside the error code table.&#0160;</p>
<p>We need to put a text prefix in front of our error numbers.&#0160; Visual studio won’t like it if we have a number as our first character, so we are going to add the word “error” in front of all error number.&#0160; Select all the error numbers, right click, and choose “Format Cells.”&#0160; In the number tab, put in <strong>“error”0</strong> as the custom format.&#0160; Now we have a word in front of our error codes.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2012/BetterErrorMessages/formatCells.png" /></p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>Your error code table should look like this. <br /><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2012/BetterErrorMessages/excel.png" /></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #ff5a00;" />
<p><strong>Step 3: Copy into Visual Studio</strong></p>
<p>Inside of your Visual Studio project, create a new RESX file if you don’t have one already.&#0160; To create a new one, you need to add a new Resources File to your project.&#0160; If you are not familiar with the concept, a resources file is a place to store things in your program like images and string tables.&#0160; It’s the perfect place for this error code table.</p>
<p>In Excel, select the first two columns from our error code table.&#0160; Don’t select all rows, just the rows with error codes in them.&#0160; Copy these cells.</p>
<p>In Visual Studio, select your RESX file and go to the Strings part.&#0160; Run the paste command and it should put in all our data.&#0160; Now we have all our error codes in a format where it is easy to look up from our code.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2012/BetterErrorMessages/resx.png" /></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #ff5a00;" />
<p><strong>Step 4 (optional): Error handling with Invoke Events </strong></p>
<p>As I mentioned in my <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2011/12/web-service-invoke-events.html" target="_blank">Invoke Events article</a>, you have common hook point for handling all the errors coming back from the server.&#0160; So here is some example code that makes that happen…</p>

EXCERPT:
The goal for today is to display up a better message when our programs run across an error from Vault.  For example, instead of “303” as the error message, I’ll show you how to display “PermissionDenied” or whatever else you want.

That message is in the Comments column, which isn't necessarily supposed to be shown to the user.  In the case of error 1200, it should not even be in the API documentation.  

I recommend using the Name column to avoid cases like this.

<p>By default, Vault Explorer provides the View Properties Grid which provides a list of all property values for the selected object.&#0160; This is a nice default view, but us developers commonly want to have customized property views (aka. property pages).&#0160; So here is a quick primer on creating property pages in Vault Explorer.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong>&#0160; This article is basically a condensed version of Dan Leighton’s excellent AU 2011 class, <a href="http://au.autodesk.com/?nd=class&amp;session_id=9315" target="_blank">Manage Dozens of Autodesk Vault Workgroup Properties with Custom Forms and Reports</a>.&#0160; If you have the time, feel free to skip the rest of this post and view the video on the AU site.&#0160; Also, his handout is full of sample code!</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #ff5a00;" />
<p>The first step is to set up your project for writing a Vault Explorer extension.&#0160; You can read up on this in the SDK documentation.&#0160; Or you can just copy the HelloWorld example and build off that.&#0160;</p>
<p>Property pages in Vault Explorer most commonly take the form of custom tabs or custom dialogs.&#0160; I’ll be showing an example of a custom tab, which means we start by defining our own User Control (right click on your project and select Add –&gt; User Control).&#0160; Now we have a blank control.&#0160; Next you drag and drop controls from the Toolbox into your custom control.&#0160; Usually each property will have two controls, one to display the property name and one to display the property value. A Label control is usually used for the property name.&#0160; The value is usually represented by a TextBox, but there are tons of controls to choose from.&#0160; Other useful controls are ComboBoxes, CheckBoxes, DateTimePickers, RadioButtons, and so on.&#0160; For this example, I’ll keep it simple and just stick to TextBoxes.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2012/PropertyPages/control.png" /></p>
<p>Now that we have our controls in place, we need a way to map the specific property values to the correct controls.&#0160; Sure we could just hard code the mapping for each TextBox, but that doesn’t leave us with any reusable code.&#0160; It also doesn’t make things easy for us in the future if we have to make changes to our property page.&#0160; A better way is to add meta-data to our controls.&#0160; At runtime we route the property data to the correct control based on the meta-data.</p>
<p>There are a couple of ways to set the meta-data on a control.&#0160; In this example, I’ll use the “Tag” property.&#0160; I want to set my TextBox Tag values to something that will let me locate the Vault property.&#0160; You can use the display name of the Vault property if you are sure that it won’t change.&#0160; Otherwise, I suggest using the system name.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2012/PropertyPages/tagProperty.png" /></p>
<p>Now we have our control, and our TextBoxes are smart enough to know what Vault property they are supposed to display.&#0160; The next step is to write code that looks up the Vault properties on a File and routes those values to the correct TextBox…    <br />Or you could just copy my code from the examples below.</p>
<p><a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/Files/PropertyPages/FilePropertyPage.cs" target="_blank">Click here for C# code</a> <br /><a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/Files/PropertyPages/FilePropertyPage.vb" target="_blank">Click here for VB.NET code</a></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #ff5a00;" />
<p>Here is the final output.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2012/PropertyPages/output.png" /></p>
<p>If we ever need to display more properties on the page, it’s as easy as dropping in the new TextBox and setting the Tag value.</p>
<p>This is just a simple example to get you started.&#0160; More complex cases involve different data types, different control types and allowing the user to edit values through your property page.&#0160;</p>

Hi Doug,

Thanks again for this great and sample. Dan Leighton’s class was indeed fun & great to attend...!

I have two questions regarding the property pages:

1) Would it be possible to include some general code in an extension (pretty much similar to what included in this blog item), but instead of compiling an userform in the extension make a reference in the extension to a webpage? 

The workflow i am thinking of is to add a webpage to the IIS which is being used by Vault. Then add a detailpane tab with a WebBrowser control on it and load the webpage. 

The extension should load all the right properties into the controls which are placed on this webpage. This workflow would make it very easy to make changes to the properties shown and the positions of the controls without having to recompile the extension.

Would it be possible? Do you have any tips or concerns about this workflow? (I personally never did something with aspx pages)

2) In the current Vault API it is possible to add custom DetailPane tabs, but it's not possible to change the order of the tabs.. Could that be made possible in a future release? Or is that impossible to introcude? (I would like the Property Page for example to be before the History tab).

1) I don't have much experience programming web pages either, but in theory you can apply the same techniques as with a winform dialog.

Based on our own web client, I can say that managing the Vault security is one of the difficult aspects of this approach.  For example...
How do you maintain the Vault credentials?  How do you know when to log out of Vault?

2) It's not possible to control the tab order, and it's not on our roadmap.  But I'll keep the feature in mind.  Thanks.

I just stick to the Visual Studio default.  Microsoft Sans Serif is the font, I think.

Why do you ask?

<p>The third type of event we introduced in Vault 2012 is the Web Service Invoke Events.&#0160; If you want to read up on the other two types, you can go <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2011/04/faq-events.html">here</a> and <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2011/09/vault-explorer-command-events.html">here</a>.&#0160; The purpose of the Invoke events is to give you a single choke point for whenever <strong><em>your</em></strong> code invokes a web service call to the Vault Server.&#0160;</p>
<p>Notice that I stressed the word <em><strong>your</strong></em>.&#0160; This type of event is not for hooking to the existing Vault features.&#0160; That’s what the Web <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2011/04/faq-events.html">Service Command Events</a> are for.</p>
<p>The Invoke events just helps you manage your own code.&#0160; And because it’s limited to you code, there is a lot more you can do with it.&#0160; For example, you can alter parameters going in and out.&#0160; With all the other event types, you are just an observer.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #5acb04;" />
<p>So what is this good for?&#0160; Offhand, I can think of 4 uses:</p>
<p>1. <strong>Common Error Handling</strong> – I find that I want to handle Exceptions from the Vault Server in the same way most of the time.&#0160; I don’t want to have the same handler code sprinkled all over my app, so I can just put it all in an event handler.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Logging</strong> – Let’s say you’re a consultant, and you developed an app for a customer.&#0160; That app is not working properly, and you have to figure out why.&#0160; You can’t just run in the debugger on the customer’s machine.&#0160; So how to you get information on what is happening inside your app?&#0160; The solution is to sprinkle logging capability throughout your code so that you can get a nice trace from the customer.&#0160; Using Invoke events you now have a way to log every Vault server call.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Debugging</strong> – Even during the development process it’s good to have a print out of what is going on between your code and the Vault server.&#0160; If you code is very complex, it’s very difficult to keep track of which commands result in which API calls.&#0160; These events can help sort things out for you.&#0160;</p>
<p>4. <strong>Performance</strong> – If you app is slow, it’s helpful to know how much time is being used by calls to the Vault server.&#0160; Based on my past experience, slowness is usually due to redundant API calls or calls that can be optimized.&#0160;</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>Coming soon:&#0160; Sample code....</p>

<p>I was busy at AU last week, which is why there wasn&#39;t much activity from me online.&#0160; I&#39;m not going to repeat AU news that has already been <a href="http://underthehood-autodesk.typepad.com/blog/2011/11/what-happened-in-vegasau2011-diary-day-2.html">posted elsewhere</a> (PLM, Autodesk 360, etc), that&#39;s not what this blog is about.&#0160; I&#39;ll keep things focused on the Vault API and share some things I learned.</p>
<p>Yes, I learn things at AU.&#0160; Not things about the Vault API, but how people perceive and use the Vault API.&#0160; The more I understand my users, the better I can distribute information.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve known for some time that the API consumers fall into two camps, the professional programmers and the non-professional &quot;scripters&quot;.&#0160; Since I&#39;m a professional programmer myself, I&#39;m good at providing information targeted at the first group.&#0160; The second group is where I rely heavily on feedback.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #666666;" />
<p><strong>The Scripter persona</strong></p>
<p>Let me take a crack at describing the Scripter (feel free to let me know if I missed something).&#0160; This person wants to customize the Vault but doesn&#39;t want to spend days learning the entire Vault API.&#0160; Usually they want to write tools tailored to their own environment.&#0160; There is a task that they do over and over and they want to automate the process or reduce mouse clicks.&#0160; The best-case scenario for them is to find a similar tool that they can tailor to their own needs.&#0160; Having to start from scratch is a big pain and sometimes a show stopper.</p>
<p>Cost of entry is also a big factor.&#0160; It&#39;s very important that a scripter can get something working early on, even if its just a Hello World example.&#0160; Spending hours figuring out how to get a command to load is not acceptable.&#0160;</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #666666;" />
<p><strong>Feedback</strong></p>
<p>Most of the feedback I get from scripters is positive so I&#39;d like to share that with you.&#0160; I don&#39;t get much feedback on things that aren&#39;t working, but I do get questions like &quot;Do you have an app that does X?&quot;</p>
<p><strong>The good:</strong>&#0160; <strong>SDK Samples</strong> <br />These examples are easy to read and easy for scripters to modify.     <br /><strong>How to make it better:</strong>&#0160; More samples in the same style.&#0160; In other words, samples that illustrate one useful concept in a clear and simple way.&#0160;</p>
<p><strong>The good:</strong>&#0160; <strong>.NET</strong> <br />It&#39;s an easy-to-use and powerful programming platform.&#0160; It&#39;s free and supports VB.     <br /><strong>How to make it better:</strong>&#0160; Get rid of the &quot;compile&quot; step.&#0160; This goes back to reducing cost-of-entry.&#0160; The less steps equals lower cost-of-entry.&#0160; And, technically, scripting means that the code does not need to be compiled.&#0160; There are a couple of techniques that can help with this goal, such as PowerShell and run-time compilation.&#0160; I haven&#39;t yet taken a serious look at these techniques, but it&#39;s on my agenda.</p>

<p>Update:&#0160; <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2012/05/q-tools-and-watch-folder-2013.html" target="_self">Watch Folder 2013</a> is now available.</p>
<p>Looking for that perfect gift to give this year?&#0160; Why not give the gift of Watch Folder?!&#0160; I just updated it to work with Vault 2012, and I added in support for HTML style emails.</p>
<p>In case you aren&#39;t familiar with it, Watch Folder is an app that allows you to &quot;watch&quot; a set of Vault folders so that you receive email notifications when files get added or updated in those folders.&#0160;</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2011/WatchFolder/Inbox.png" />&#0160;</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #013181;" />
<p><strong>Requirements:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Vault Workgroup/Collaboration/Professional 2012 </li>
<li>Job Server enabled </li>
<li>An SMTP server somewhere on the network </li>
</ul>
<p>NOTE:&#0160; This isn&#39;t something you can just download and run.&#0160; The Vault administrator needs to set up some server components before this feature can be used.</p>
<p><a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/Apps/WatchFolder/WatchFolder-2.0.1.0-bin.zip">Click here to download the application</a> <br /><a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/Apps/WatchFolder/WatchFolder-2.0.1.0-src.zip">Click here to download the source code</a></p>
<p><a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/Apps/WatchFolder/WatchFolder-Hotfix-2.0.3.0.zip" target="_self">Click here for the 2.0.3.0 hotfix</a> - Applies only to the Job Processor component.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #013181;" />
<p><strong>To use</strong></p>
<p>For Vault users, download the application and run the installer.&#0160; Just make sure that the administrator has set up the Vault environment first.&#0160; Next, start up Vault Explorer and right-click on a folder that you want to watch.&#0160; Select the Watch Folder command and decide how frequently you want notifications.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2010/WatchFolder/menuCommand.png" /></p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2010/WatchFolder/dialog.png" /></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #013181;" />
<p>For Vault administrators, download the application and run the installer.&#0160; Next follow the instructions in the readme file in the install folder (%ProgramData%\Autodesk\Vault 2012\Extensions\WatchFolderCommand).</p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A watch on a folder will automatically apply to any sub-folders. </li>
<li>Removing a watch will also remove watches on sub-folders. </li>
<li>You can&#39;t have an immediate watch and a summary watch on the same folder.&#0160; Setting a folder to one type overwrites the existing setting. </li>
<li>You need to be at least Document Editor (level 1) in order to set up a watch on a folder. </li>
<li>You need to have a valid email address in your Vault user settings. </li>
<li>The contents of the email can be customized by the Vault administrator.&#0160; See readme file. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Migrating from version 1:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The admin install is still a lot of steps.&#0160; I did a bit of consolidation, the Job Processor plug-in and the Vault Explorer plug-in have been combined.</li>
<li>All the settings files from R1 can still be used, just copy over WatchCollection.xml, WatchSettings.xml and WatchEmailBody.txt over to the install folder.</li>
<li>I recommend updating WatchSettings to use an HTML file instead of a text file.&#0160; There are more formatting options and you can have hyperlinks.</li>
<li>More file informaiton can be provided in the email.&#0160; See readme for more details.</li>
</ul>
<ul>

Hi Doug,

i installed watch folder 2012, and edited the jobprocessor.exe.config like you described in your readme, when i start the jobserver and check the jobtypes, there are only the default jobtypes listed.
In the jobprocessor.log i get the following error:

Error 6/12/2012 6:30:03 PM
Value cannot be null.
Parameter name: key 
Exception: System.ArgumentNullException: Value cannot be null.
Parameter name: key
   at System.ThrowHelper.ThrowArgumentNullException(ExceptionArgument argument)
   at System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary`2.FindEntry(TKey key)
   at JobProcessor.HandlerManager.LoadHandlerTypes()
----------------------------------------


could you help me?

Sorry, I think there is a typo in the readme.
The assembly "WatchFolderJobHandler" was renamed to "WatchFolderCommand" and I don't think everything was updated.

Try using these settings in JobProcessor.config.exe:

  &lt;jobHandler class="Autodesk.WatchFolder.SettingJob" handler="WatchFolderCommand.HandlerClass, WatchFolderCommand"/&gt;
  &lt;jobHandler class="Autodesk.WatchFolder.NotificationJob" handler="WatchFolderCommand.HandlerClass, WatchFolderCommand"/&gt;

Serches could be saved as folders, right?
Could WatchFolder be used to subscribe to folder-type search results changes? Or if there any other way to achieve the desired?
Thanks in advance.

Couple issues found:
1. Subject shows only "N" while it is left default in WatchSettings.xml
2. Link that is included in message fails to open because of Cyrrilic chars that Russian Vault creates by default.

No.  Saved searches are not real folders, they just look that way.  Saved searches are stored client-side, so there is no easy way to do achieve you want.

Hi Doug

I am wondering if watch folder could be used to monitor users doing a get of files in a folder?

Thanks

No.  Vault doesn't track downloads, so there is no way for an app to query for that information.

<p>Many people have noticed that with Web Service Command Events, there is no way to tell the name of the Vault you are connected to.&#0160; You can get a context to make API calls, but the Vault name is not part of the context.&#0160; It&#39;s a limitation of the architecture.</p>
<p>So here is my suggested workaround:&#0160; Create a Vault Option called &quot;VaultName&quot; and store the name there.&#0160; That way, your code can call KnowledgeVaultService﻿.GetVaultOption(&quot;VaultName&quot;) to get the Vault name.&#0160;</p>
<p>Of course, the option has to be set up ahead of time, like during the install or the initial configuration of your app.</p>

<p>If you ever come across errors 1092, 1387, or 1633, you need to look at the restriction codes to figure out what the problems are.&#0160; Basically these codes are telling you, &quot;We can&#39;t fully describe the problem with a single error code so we provided extra information.&quot;</p>
<p>Error codes are limited by the fact that there can be only one of them when something goes wrong.&#0160; For cases where multiple things go wrong, extra data is contained in the restriction codes.&#0160;</p>
<p>This mechanism comes in handy when an operation is being done on multiple objects at once or multiple things can go wrong.&#0160; That way everything can be presented to the user at once instead of making them fix things one at a time.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #ff5a00;" />
<p>As a programmer, you probably just want some code that you can copy and paste into your project.&#0160; So here you go.&#0160; As always, I&#39;m eager to please.&#0160; If the Exception is coming from the vault server, the following function will return both the Vault server error code and any restriction codes.</p>

If you ever come across errors 1092, 1387, or 1633, you need to look at the restriction codes to figure out what the problems are.  Basically these codes are telling you, "We can't fully describe the problem with a single error code so we provided extra information."

Doug,

I have used your code above succesfully to trap an exception.

The exception generates a RESTRICTION ERROR of 1633. The generated child RESTRICTION CODE is 3000.

Do you have any tables that shine light on what the restriction code mean. In my case the 3000?

It's in the SDK documentation.  The .chm has a page called "Restriction Codes"

Doug,

The code I'm getting is 1008, and the .chm skips from 1007 to 1009.  Any ideas what 1008 is?

<p>So... you have your application ready, and you want to deploy it.&#0160; Which DLLs do you deploy?&#0160; This is one of those questions that can be difficult if you let it.&#0160; My job is to not let that happen.&#0160; So I&#39;ll break it down into one rule:</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" width="470">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="470"><strong>Any assemblies you reference in your project need to be available to the executing application at runtime.</strong></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>This rule applies to every piece of software in the universe.&#0160; But let&#39;s take a closer look at what this means for the various types of Vault customizations....</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #ff5a00;" />
<p><strong>You are building an EXE</strong></p>
<p>If your project output is an EXE, then it needs access to everything referenced in the project.&#0160; The simplest way to do this is to just put the referenced DLLs in the same folder as your EXE.&#0160; Visual Studio does this automatically, so you can just package up the program output and call it a day.</p>
<p><strong>You are building a Vault Explorer extension</strong></p>
<p>In the case of a custom command or tab view, you want to deploy everything that is referenced in your project <em>that Vault Explorer doesn&#39;t already have access to</em>.</p>
<p>If you look in your Vault Explorer folder (the Explorer folder under your client install location), you&#39;ll notice it already has some of the SDK DLLs, such as Autodesk.Connectivity.WebServices.dll.&#0160; However, not all the SDK DLLs are there, WebServicesTools for example.&#0160; So, you need to deploy the assemblies that are referenced by your project that are not in the Explorer folder.&#0160; When you deploy, the DLLs should be in the same folder as your extension DLL.</p>
<p><strong>You are building a Job Processor extension</strong></p>
<p>The rules are exactly the same as when building a Vault Explorer extension.&#0160; In fact, JobProcessor.exe is in the same folder as Vault Explorer, so list of available DLLs is also the same.</p>
<p><strong>You are building a Web Service (event handler) extension</strong></p>
<p>In this case, you don&#39;t know which app you are running in.&#0160; There are only 2 DLLs guaranteed to be available to the hosting app:&#0160; Autodesk.Connectivity.WebServices.dll and Autodesk.Connectivity.Extensibility.Framework.dll.&#0160; All other references should be deployed in the same folder as your extension.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #ff5a00;" />
<p>If you deploy a DLL that is already in the application&#39;s folder, you won&#39;t hurt anything.&#0160; .NET loads first from the folder that the application is running in.&#0160; So your deployed DLL will never be used in this case.</p>
<p>If multiple extensions deploy the same DLL, the only one of them will be loaded at runtime.&#0160; There is no way to know which one that will be ahead of time.</p>

So... you have your application ready, and you want to deploy it.  Which DLLs do you deploy?  This is one of those questions that can be difficult if you let it.  My job is to not let that happen.  So I'll break it down into one rule:

Any assemblies you reference in your project need to be available to the executing application at runtime.

This rule applies to every piece of software in the universe.  But let's take a closer look at what this means for the various types of Vault customizations....

<p>Usually, I try to present information in a clear, organized manner.&#0160; However, that&#39;s not the way I work on a day to day basis.&#0160; My thoughts are usually organized in brain dumps.&#0160; Basically it&#39;s a bunch of idea fragments loosely tied around a central concept.</p>
<p>As the Vault API matures, certain patterns emerge on how add-ins should work.&#0160; I&#39;ve been making notes on these patterns, but I don&#39;t have anything well organized yet.&#0160; So here is my current brain dump.&#0160; This is a bit of an experiment.&#0160; Maybe some people will find this useful. Or maybe not, in which case I&#39;ll abandon the format in future posts.</p>
<p><strong>Application Patterns      <br /></strong>What are the common patterns in Vault customizations?</p>
<p>Admin-specific vs user-specific features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Customizations usually have a mix of commands, some for the Vault administrator and some for the end user. </li>
<li>Admin commands are usually related to configuration.</li>
<li>User commands are usually the things that do the real work. </li>
<li>Admin steps are sometimes needed before user features are available.      <br />For example, Vault Web View can&#39;t be used until the Vault admin designates a URL property. </li>
<li>Admin settings are best stored in the vault.&#0160; Vault Options are a good way of doing this.</li>
<li>User settings are best stored on the local computer.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other:</p>
<ul>
<li>Custom tabs are always shown for a given object type.&#0160; This aspect limits it&#39;s use.&#0160; For example, a tab that shows layer information about a DWG is useless for every other file type, resulting in UI clutter.</li>
<li>Custom jobs are usually what you use when you want an operation to happen &quot;on the server&quot;</li>
<li>Job processor extensions are usually double sided.&#0160; You have the customization that adds the job to the queue and you have the job handler that executes the job.&#0160; These two components will almost always have code to share. </li>
<li>It doesn&#39;t matter how cool your blog is or how many emails you send out,&#0160; you still have to keep reminding people that you already wrote an app for that. </li>
</ul>
<p>Got more to add?&#0160; Drop me a comment.</p>

<p>If you have developed an extension to Vault Explorer, you probably noticed the HiddenCommands() function in the IExtension interface.&#0160; The theory behind this function is that your extension can overwrite a command by hiding it from the menus and providing a replacement command.&#0160; It&#39;s a good theory on paper, but does it hold up in practice?</p>
<p>I&#39;ve written two apps that make use of this feature, with varying degrees of success.&#0160;</p>
<p><a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2010/06/the-recycle-bin-20.html">Recycle Bin 2.0</a> hides the Delete command in an attempt to force a new process.&#0160; Things didn&#39;t work out too well when I deployed this on our internal Vault.&#0160; Delete is a pretty fundamental operation.&#0160; If you are going to remove something like that, you&#39;d better have something good as a replacement.&#0160; Unfortunately, Recycle Bin wasn&#39;t up to the challenge, and I reverted things after a few weeks.</p>
<p><a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2011/06/hyperlink-maestro.html">Hyperlink Maestro</a> hides the Copy Hyperlink command and replaces it with a better one.&#0160; This time things worked out better.&#0160; Mainly because the new function does everything the old one does and more.&#0160; So end users are not losing anything by having the extension installed.&#0160; Personally, I can&#39;t go back to the default command.&#0160; I&#39;m hooked on Maestro.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #ff5a00;" />
<p>Here are some alternatives to hiding a command:</p>
<ul>
<li>Place your new command alongside the default command.&#0160; </li>
<li>Use events to work with the existing command instead of trying to hide it. </li>
</ul>
<p><br />If you still want to use the hidden commands feature, here are some best practices:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don&#39;t hide a function unless you can provide a superior replacement. </li>
<li>Don&#39;t override a function unless you fully understand it&#39;s functionality.&#0160; Even something that seems simple, like Delete, can have uses that you didn&#39;t consider. </li>
<li>Most functions are too cost prohibitive to override.&#0160; Copy Hyperlink was easy to do, but something like Copy Design would take months to write. </li>
</ul>

Doug - pretty old post, but I'm discovering something that's also worth noting here...

HiddenCommands() gets called very early in the process - before you have logged in. So there's no way of using it for "runtime" turning off of commands, i.e. hide "config" commands unless you're an admin.

Does this sound correct?

You are right that there is no runtime hiding of commands.  And you can't hide commands based on the current user's access level.

All Vault Explorer commands have this limitation, not just custom commands.

<p>I finally completed a connector between Vault and <a href="http://bluestreak.autodesk.com/">Bluestreak</a>.&#0160; A while back I <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2011/07/bluestreak-and-vault-you-design-it-i-code-it.html">asked for feedback</a>, and the response was pretty minimal.&#0160; But, there was a common theme: file upload.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2011/VaultHeartBK/UploadCommand.png" /></p>
<p>In addition to the upload feature, my extension will add items to your activity stream in Bluestreak.&#0160; It will log activities whenever you move a file or item to a released state.&#0160; It will also log all change order state changes.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2011/VaultHeartBK/ActivityStream.png" /></p>
<p>That&#39;s about it for now.&#0160; This is just a first pass at something between Vault and Bluestreak.&#0160; There is a lot of room for new features and improvements.&#0160; If the response to this app is good, there may be updates in the near future.</p>

I have no plans to update this application.  There was not much response when I released it, and there hasn't been much interest in an update.
<a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2012/09/survey-what-apps-should-i-update.html">http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2012/09/survey-what-apps-should-i-update.html</a>

A workaround is to use the Vault 2012 client for all your Bluestreak activities.

Can I ask what you use Vault Heart Bluestreak for.  What features do you use?

Doug, thank you for your answer.
 I see Vault Heart Bluestreak as a wonderful tool for the registration Vault users' actions in  Bluestreak, and also as a tool that helps to share files with subcontractors and clients.
May be you know a better tool for these goals?

<p><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/Concepts3.png" /></p>
<p>Vault 2012 was a very eventful release for the API in the sense that we added a 3 event engines for you to hook to in your programs.&#0160; I&#39;ve already talked about <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2011/04/faq-events.html">Web Service Command Events</a>, which is the most complex of the 3.&#0160; Now let me switch to the most simple type, Vault Explorer Command Events.</p>
<p>Whenever any UI command is invoked in Vault Explorer, it will fire a pre and a post to anyone that subscribes.&#0160; The UI command is basically everything in the main menu, toolbars, and context menus.&#0160; In your handler, you get passed in the key string for that command.&#0160; And that&#39;s it.&#0160; You don&#39;t get the selection context and you don&#39;t get any information about what happened during the command.</p>
<p>It told you it was simple.&#0160;&#0160; But don&#39;t worry, I can stretch this out to a full article.&#0160; Just because a feature is <em>simple</em> doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s <em>useless</em>.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #5acb04;" />
<p>Here are a couple of uses to get things started...</p>
<p><strong>Use #1:&#0160; Cache clearing</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes I find myself building up a cache in my custom command.&#0160; For example, I&#39;ll need to read all the file Property Definitions.&#0160; I don&#39;t want to read these objects each time my command is invoked, so I save the data in memory.&#0160; But what if I want to keep my cache up-to-date?&#0160; I just need to check for the Refresh or Admin Settings command and clear the cache at that point.</p>
<p><strong>Use #2:&#0160; Event combo</strong></p>
<p>Just like in video games, you make use of combos to get the best results.    <br />Web Service Command events are good at knowing what work is being done but only in isolation.&#0160; They don&#39;t know what overall command is being done.&#0160; Vault Explorer Command events are just the opposite.&#0160; If you combine the two, you have a fairly complete picture.</p>
<p>Here is the timeline of a Copy Design operation that creates 3 files.&#0160; The top blue lines are the Vault Explorer events, the bottom blue lines are the web service events, and the red lines are the web service function calls.&#0160;</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2011/VECommandEvents/Timeline.png" /></p>
<p>We can make good use of all these events.&#0160; For example, you can send out an email report after a copy design is completed.&#0160; Here is how you would do it:</p>
<ol>
<li>In the Vault Explorer pre event for Copy Design:&#0160; Create a new List. </li>
<li>In the DocumentService AddFile post event:&#0160; Add the File to your List. </li>
<li>In the Vault Explorer post event for Copy Design:&#0160; Use the entries in the List to send out the email report explaining which files were added via Copy Design. </li>
</ol>
<p>Now you&#39;re playing with power!&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #5acb04;" />
<p><strong>Cheat Code:</strong>&#0160;</p>
<p>You will probably want to know the key string values for the various UI commands.&#0160; This information isn&#39;t documented anywhere.&#0160; But here some code that you can use to build your own dev app that displays the key value each time you invoke a command in Vault explorer.</p>

EXCERPT:
Vault 2012 was a very eventful release for the API in the sense that we added a 3 event engines for you to hook to in your programs.  I've already talked about Web Service Command Events, which is the most complex of the 3.  Now let me switch to the most simple type, Vault Explorer Command Events.

It's part of the IExtension interface that you use for writing custom commands.  OnStartUp runs when Vault Explorer starts up.

Solved the Problem Doug by checking the CommandId Property of each command..

Above Copy Design sample is for old Copy Design. For new Copy Design, which is a modeless dialog, CommandEnd event will be fired once the dialog is shown. However, there is another Autodesk.DataManagement.Client.Framework.Vault.Forms.Library.CopyDesignDialogClosed event which is fired when new copy design dialog is closed. So it could be a replacement of the CommandEnd event here.

<p>Today is the 2 year anniversary of this blog.&#0160; So I would like to do a recap of some of the highlights from the past year.</p>
<p><strong>App Mania</strong></p>
<p>Not surprisingly, the free apps continue to be very popular.&#0160; This year it wasn&#39;t just me writing all the apps.&#0160; Other Autodesk developers got in the act with awesome apps like, <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2011/06/drawing-compare.html">Drawing Compare</a>, <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2011/04/vault-gadget.html">Vault Gadget</a>, and a <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2011/03/google-map-extension.html">Google Map plug-in</a>.</p>
<p>The downside is that there are <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2011/04/help-too-many-sample-apps.html">too many legacy apps to upgrade</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Videos</strong></p>
<p>I try to do a webinar series each year.&#0160; Back in December I did a <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2011/01/webinar-videos.html">set of case studies</a> using some of my apps as examples.&#0160; The result is almost 4 hours of video where I talk through my own source code.&#0160; At first I was hesitant, thinking that audiences would find it too boring.&#0160; But the webcasts were well received, so I&#39;ll probably use the &quot;case study&quot; format more in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Advanced Content</strong></p>
<p>A lot of my blog articles are focused on specific features, such as <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2011/04/faq-events.html">Events</a>, <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2011/04/goodbye-shares-hello-links.html">Links</a> and <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2011/05/file-resolution.html">File Resolution</a>.&#0160; Although articles like that are useful, they are a bit on the dry side.&#0160; It&#39;s like writing a textbook chapter.</p>
<p>It&#39;s nice when I can break out of that format and go deeper that just a single feature.&#0160; <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2011/03/coding-for-performance-getting-all-files.html">Coding for Performance</a> articles.&#0160; I hope to continue the series this year, and maybe I&#39;ll be able to come up with another series along those lines.</p>
<p><strong>Tech Support</strong></p>
<p>Vault 2012 marks the first time there were bugs in the API itself.&#0160; In those cases, the blog became a mechanism for communicating <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2011/04/issues-with-the-vault-2012-api.html">workarounds</a> and <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2011/06/2-api-related-hotfixes.html">hotfixes</a>.&#0160;</p>
<p>And there&#39;s the comments sections, which have been used for tech support from time to time.&#0160; However, the new <a href="http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/Autodesk-Vault-Customization/bd-p/301">Vault API newsgroup</a> is usually the better way to get API support.&#0160; Either way, the odds are good that you will get a response from me.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/TipsAndTricks3.png" /></p>
<p>I&#39;ve been getting a lot of questions about Autodesk.Connectivity.Explorer.ExtensibilityTools.dll so I thought I would explain a bit about it.&#0160; On the surface it looks like a collection of useful functions, but there&#39;s more to it that you should be aware of.</p>
<p>Most importantly, you need to be aware of two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using this DLL creates a mini Vault Explorer within your process. </li>
<li>There is a significant memory and performance cost with these tools.&#0160; <br />For example, Downloading a small Inventor file will cause about 60 MB of DLLs to be loaded.&#0160; The initial load may take about 1.5 seconds. </li>
</ul>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #ff5a00;" />
<p>The concept behind ExtensibilityTools is simple enough.&#0160; Provide some functions which do client-side operations.&#0160; The web service API is only concerned with server features.&#0160; By design, it can&#39;t do anything related to client-side data.&#0160; Meanwhile the Vault Explorer client performs a lot of client-side operations, seemingly with ease.&#0160; People would frequently ask me for these features and indicate that &quot;it should just work like Vault Explorer&quot;.</p>
<p>The trick is that a lot of the Vault Explorer features are not easy at all.&#0160; Update Properties, for example, is very hard if the property is mapped to a property in the CAD file.&#0160; In these cases, the CAD API needs to be loaded in order to update the CAD file on disk.&#0160; So that implies that A) you have a bunch of CAD API&#39;s handy and B) you have a way to determine which one to use.</p>
<p>If all that logic were placed directly into the SDK, it would become huge because you would have to re-distribute the CAD APIs along with it.&#0160; Instead, ExtensibilityTools just acts as a gateway to Vault Explorer, which already has all the supported CAD API&#39;s.&#0160; This keeps the SDK small and re-uses an existing product.&#0160; The downside is that Vault Explorer was never intended to work in this mode.&#0160; It&#39;s optimized for UI workflows, and not meant to be a utility library.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #ff5a00;" />
<p><strong>Best practices:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If possible, try to load IExplorerUtils only once and hold on to the reference. </li>
<li>Keep in mind that there are no easy ways to unload .NET assemblies.&#0160; To the memory cost is not temporary. </li>
<li>The ideal case is if you are a Vault Explorer customization.&#0160; In that case, you there is no load cost because Vault Explorer is already loaded.&#0160; In these cases, make sure to call ExplorerLoader.GetExplorerUtil instead of LoadExplorerUtil. </li>
</ul>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #ff5a00;" />
<p><strong>Known issues:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Doesn&#39;t work with base Vault</strong> - You need Workgroup, Collaboration or Professional. </li>
<li><strong>Doesn&#39;t work inside Inventor</strong> - Vault Explorer uses Inventor Apprentice, which can&#39;t run inside of Inventor.exe. </li>
</ul>

Does UpdateFileProperties in Autodesk.Connectivity.Explorer.ExtensibilityTools.dll, in an (full SQL replication) replicated environment, if neccessary take ownership of the file before property update?

Thanks

It works just like the property edit feature in Vault Explorer.  So I believe that you do need to take ownership first before attempting to update properties.

<i>Doesn't work inside Inventor - Vault Explorer uses Inventor Apprentice, which can't run inside of Inventor.exe.</i>


I spent 1 day moving my (working) application into an Inventor addon, until I found out, that it won't work there.

- Is there a way to bypass this issue?
-Can this Information be added to Help file?
- Is it still there with Version 2015? (2014 is not working in my case?

Thanks

- The Vault add-in gets around this issue by spawning a new process.

- Yes, this DLL is still around in 2015 but "UpdateFileProperties" is the only function it does.  The rest of the features have been moved to other parts of the API.
If you use the 2015 DLL, then you will need the Vault 2015 client installed as well.

"It works just like the property edit feature in Vault Explorer."


Nope. In the property edit feature I can modify values for mapped UDPs. The UpdateFileProperties will not throw any error but just will not do that. At least that's for Vault 2014 SR1 SP2.

<p>Last year, I tried to explain the Entity concept in the Vault API, and I never felt that I did a good job.&#0160; Read <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2010/05/entities.html">the article</a> at your own peril.&#0160; In true software developer form, here is the hotfix to my bug-filled earlier article.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #5acb04;" />
<p>There are 2 concepts in the Vault API:&#0160; Entities and Behaviors.&#0160; The two concepts are intertwined; you can&#39;t describe one without describing the other.</p>
<p>An <strong>Entity</strong> is an <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>object</em></span> that can have behaviors on it.     <br />A <strong>Behavior</strong> is a <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>feature</em></span> that can be applied to entities.</p>
<p>The driver behind these concepts is something every programmer should already be familiar with: re-use.&#0160; By having features that can work with multiple object types, Vault has less code, a cleaner API, greater stability, and so on.</p>
<p>Files and Folders are examples of entities.&#0160; Properties and Categories are examples of behaviors.&#0160; Not every object in Vault is an entity, and not every feature is a behavior.&#0160; It&#39;s also important to know that a given entity type may not support every behavior.&#0160;</p>
<p>For example, here is a table explaining which entities have which behaviors in Vault Professional 2012.</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" width="467">

</table>
<p>Note:&#0160; Even though Items and Change Orders have lifecycles, the feature cannot be applied to other entity types.&#0160; The File lifecycle engine is the only one that is entity-based.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #5acb04;" />
<p>The web services in the API is structured according to the entity/behavior model as shown in the table below.&#0160;</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" width="470">

</tbody>
</table>
<p>The behavior services are easiest to spot because the functions have parameters like &quot;entityId&quot; and &quot;entityClassId&quot;.&#0160; In the entity-based services, the functions usually take more specific IDs, such as &quot;fileId&quot;.&#0160; Let&#39;s focus more on the terminology used in the behavior services.</p>
<p><strong>EntityId</strong> - Each entity has an ID that uniquely identifies it.&#0160; Usually this is the &quot;Id&quot; property on the object.&#0160; For example:&#0160; File.Id</p>
<p><strong>EntityMasterId</strong> - If the entity can be versioned, then there is a master ID, which is used to refer to the entire collection of versions.&#0160; Usually this is the &quot;MasterId&quot; property on the object.&#0160; For example:&#0160; File.MasterId     <br />If a function is asking for an EntityMasterId, but the object doesn&#39;t have one, just pass in the ID value.&#0160; For example:&#0160; Folder.Id</p>
<p><strong>EntityClassId</strong> - This is a string value containing the type name.&#0160; Call AdminService.GetServerConfiguration() to see the list of legal values.&#0160; For your convenience, I will list them out here.</p>

<p>Update:&#0160; <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2013/09/vault-web-view-2014.html" target="_self">Vault Web View 2014</a> is now available.&#0160; Sorry, there is no 2013 version.</p>
<p>Here is my update of <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2010/08/vault-web-view.html">Vault Web View</a>.&#0160; It&#39;s basically a web control embedded in a Vault Explorer tab.&#0160;</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2010/VaultWebView/screenshot-scaled.png" /></p>
<p>To use it, your Vault administrator sets up a Vault property which will contain the URL information.&#0160; After that, whenever you select a Vault object that contains the property, the Web View tab will browse to that URL.&#0160; The URL can be set and updated using Vault&#39;s property editor.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #013181;" />
<p><strong>Requirements:</strong> <br />Vault Workgroup/Collaboration/Professional 2012</p>
<p><a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/Apps/VaultWebView/VaultWebView-2.0.1.0-bin.zip">Click here to download the application</a> <br /><a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/Apps/VaultWebView/VaultWebView-2.0.1.0-src.zip">Click here to download the source code</a></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #013181;" />
<p><strong>Enhancements:      <br /></strong>In version 1.0 a custom command was needed to set and update a folder URL.&#0160; In Vault 2012, folders can have property values, so Web View was updated to use properties instead of a custom command.&#0160; Version 2 also allows you to set URL data on all main entity types (files, folders, items and change orders).&#0160; Lastly, you don&#39;t need to be an administrator to set the URL.&#0160; Anyone who can set property data, can set the URL.&#0160; I&#39;m not sure if this is good or not, but it&#39;s a result of using Vault property data.</p>

Hi Doug,

I ran the installer for Vault Web View 2.0 on my test server for Vault Professional 2013 as well as on a client computer.  The installer completed successfully and even shows up in Add/Remove Programs but I don't see any new UI elements in Vault Pro 2013.  I was expecting to see the new tab and property values and a Configure Web View command.  Do you know what I might be missing?

Thanks,
Michael

This version only works with Vault 2012.  There is no 2013 version of Vault Web View.

If you want to use this app with Vault 2013, you or somebody who knows how to program will have to download the source code and port it over to the Vault 2013 SDK.

<p>That&#39;s it.&#0160; I&#39;ve had it.&#0160; I&#39;m sick of constantly creating arrays with one object in them just so I can call Vault API functions.&#0160; No more, I say!&#0160; Thanks to the <strong>extension method</strong> feature of .NET, I can now create a method on <span style="color: #0000ff;">object</span> to easily do this for me.&#0160;</p>
<p>LINQ already gives me FirstOrDefault that lets me convert an array to a single value.&#0160; Here is a function that does the inverse.</p>

<p>Looking at the code, it doesn&#39;t look like one is better than the other.&#0160; But when you are <em>typing</em> the code out, the extension method makes things much easier.&#0160; You don&#39;t have to fiddle with []{} characters and intellesense will type most of the function name for you.</p>
<p>This is just a basic example of a powerful feature.&#0160; There are tons of uses and misuses for extension methods, so make sure to read up on it in MSDN.&#0160;</p>

<p>For Vault 2011, I told you <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2010/10/signing-the-webservices-dll.html">how to sign and unsigned DLL</a>.&#0160; Those steps worked great if you have a single, isolated DLL.&#0160; For Vault 2012, there are multiple interlinked DLLs, so the steps get much more complicated.</p>
<p>Instead of going over complicated steps, I&#39;ll just post the strong-named versions of the DLLs.&#0160; These DLLs are not officially supported, but they are the same ones used in the Vault SharePoint integration.&#0160; So some level of testing has been performed.</p>

<p>The Vault 2012 API has a formalized concept of an Extension.&#0160; In the Vault 2011, the concept was there, but there was no clear set of rules or behaviors.&#0160; By defining things more clearly in 2012, the concept is easier to understand, and the groundwork is laid for future API enhancements.</p>
<p><strong>The Definition:      <br /></strong>A Vault Extension is a component that doesn&#39;t run on its own, but gets loaded by the Vault framework.     <br />Currently, there are 3 types:&#0160; Vault Explorer extensions, Job Processor extensions, and Web Service Command extensions.</p>
<p><strong>The Rules:      <br /></strong>There is a common set of rules that all extensions must follow.</p>
<ul>
<li>They are all .NET assemblies.</li>
<li>They must have values for 5 specific assembly attributes:&#0160; AssemblyCompany, AssemblyProduct, AssemblyDescription, ExtensionId, and APIVersion.      <br />The first three are put in by Visual Studio.&#0160; The last two are from the Vault API. </li>
<li>They must be deployed with a .vcet.config file. </li>
<li>They must be deployed to a folder under %programData%\Autodesk\Vault 2012\Extensions.&#0160; 1 Extension per folder. </li>
<li>They must have a single, public class that implements the interface for that extension type. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The interfaces:</strong></p>
<p>The interface implementations are important because the Vault framework uses that class as the entry point into your customization.&#0160; The interface is how the Vault sees your code, and Vault is not concerned with anything underneath.</p>

</table>
<p><strong>Mixing and matching:      <br /></strong>It&#39;s possible to have a DLL to implement more than 1 extension type.&#0160; In fact, this works really well with the Job Processor and Vault Client extension types.&#0160; Mixing the Web Service extension type with other types is trickier because you don&#39;t know the application context.&#0160; As a result, the DLLs from the other extension type might not be available to the running application.&#0160;&#0160; <br />Job Processor and Vault Client work well together because they have the same working folder, and therefore, have access to the same DLLs.</p>

hi!this is my first post in just one and zeros, i was wondering how to handle a multiple plug in scenario
where those plugins shares a library who's not in the GAC but it's strong named.
Whould it be possible to do an assembly load somewhere ?

to add more details,
I'm talking about the 2013 API and to me looks like adding to the class that implements the iExtension interface a constructor, that will be called.
BUT unfortunately seems like that vault checks for all the reference the plugIn needs and if he can't find all of them just does not load the plugin so no custom load is allowed ... kinda of frustrating :(

First, there is a way to see the load errors.  <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2012/07/extension-loading-error-logging.html">http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2012/07/extension-loading-error-logging.html</a>

Next, if your DLL references another DLL not in the GAC, you have a couple of options.  
You can copy the referenced DLLs to the same folder as your extension.  But this only works if there are a few small DLLs.
If you are dealing with a large API framework, you will have to remove all direct references in your project, and use one of the Assembly.Load functions instead.  This makes your code much harder to work with, but it allows your DLL to load first before loading the references.

I'm aware that DLL load paths are an issue, and the issues is being worked on.

Actually i found a dirty solution, Since the nice ones where not working!
I've created a new plugin who bind the appdomain.AssemblyLoad event to a function who scan what is being loaded and i managed to get it loaded first, when Vault try to load my plugin i do an assembly load of my libs...
I think would be nice to understand if it is vault who's checking for dependency to prevent crashes during later use (i think this is probable) or it's the clr, so maybe in the next API the could give us an overridable function called LoadAssemblies who get called before the check... maybe
Or a list of dll paths who vault can try to load and skip the plugin loading if some fails

It's the CLR that is preventing the load.  The Vault framework attempts to fix things by manually loading from known locations, but it could be more robust.

If you want to see what is being planned, sign up for the Beta and we can chat more.  I put the invite link in today's posting.

Hello,

As I understand Web Service Command Extension is loaded on any application which is using Autodesk.Connectivity.WebServices.dll.

I have created such extension and it does load when Vault client is launched.

But my extension doesn't load when Inventor with Vault addin is launched.

What can be wrong?
Is Vault addin for Inventor use Autodesk.Connectivity.WebServices.dll?

Regards,
Kamil

My first guess is that is a version issue.  Events only work for a specific version.  So if you build event handlers with the 2015 SDK, it will only work with the 2015 clients.
See this article for more details:  <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2012/09/events-and-multiple-client-versions.html">http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2012/09/events-and-multiple-client-versions.html</a>

If that's not the problem, have a look at this article on how to get more information.  <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2012/07/extension-loading-error-logging.html">http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2012/07/extension-loading-error-logging.html</a>

And yes, Inventor uses Autodesk.Connectivity.WebServices.dll.

<p>I&#39;ve had some requests to write a Vault extension that talks to <a href="http://bluestreak.autodesk.com/">Bluestreak</a>.&#0160; There is only one problem, I have no idea how the thing would work.&#0160; Sure, I could talk with some of the Vault product designers and the Bluestreak team to get more information.&#0160; But I&#39;m going to try something experimental.&#0160; I&#39;m going to let <strong>you</strong>, my readers, design the thing.</p>
<p>If you have an idea, sent it to doug.redmond AT autodesk.com.&#0160; Feel free to include things like features, workflows and even rough UI sketches.</p>
<p>Some things to note:</p>
<ul>
<li>My time is limited.&#0160; Just like with all my other sample apps, this is a side project.&#0160; So don&#39;t get too complex in your feature requests.</li>
<li>I reserve the right to not implement your request for any reason.&#0160; Try not to take it personal. </li>

Great I can't wait to see how this pans out. I don't think i know enough to really offer usable features in time for your speedy coding. But Collaboration through Vault with users who don't have vault offsite would be extremely handy. I would like it to play nicely with Inventor data & workflows

How about I answer it right here?  The discussion groups are acting very buggy right now.

Yes, you can install Q-Tools on the ADMS server.  It can actually be installed anywhere on the network as long as it can connect to all the Vault sites.

Doug - I saw a post from you from back last year saying that the tool was only designed to run on a multi-workgroup environment.  We have a filestore only replicated environment, has this tool been updated recently to cater for that? Reason I ask is that the Q-Tools service won't start unless I chose false to having a central queue.

First, check your version.  If you don't have version 2.0.2.0 then you can download it from the links in this post.

If that's not the problem, send me your settings.xml file.  It's probably best to post it to the Vault Customization newsgroup:

Hi,

We have a multi site replicated vault environment and your application look like it will solve our job processor issues.  I have installed and set-up so that we have one central job queue, I am running into an issue that when the job processor runs I am getting an error stating that the file is locked.  I suspect this is because the server the job queue is running on is not the "owner" of the file?  do you have any thoughts of how to resolve this?

Thanks

In Vault 2013, we put in a feature that should automatically switch ownership when possible.

In Vault 2012, fixing this issue requires custom programming.  You need to either modify QTools or create your own tool to transfer file ownership.

It should be fairly easy to update this app since it's not a plug-in.  Here are the basic steps:

1. Download the source code.
2. Open the project in the latest Visual Studio version.
3. Set the references to the 2015 or 2016 Vault SDK DLLs.
4. Fix any compile errors that may arise from changed APIs.  See the "Changes" pages in the SDK documentation.

<p>Although the web service events feature was designed to hook to all Vault clients on a computer, it doesn&#39;t meant that it is<em> required</em> to hook to them all.&#0160; Sometimes you want to hook to an event for just one application, and that&#39;s fine too.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll refer to the <strong>scope</strong> of the event as the set of applications that you are interested in receiving events from.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #ff5a00;" />
<p><strong>Scenario 1:&#0160; Global scope</strong></p>
<p>If you want to get events from all Vault clients on a computer, you can follow the instructions in the SDK documentation.&#0160; The &quot;Web Service Command Events&quot; page in the Getting Started section goes over all the details.&#0160; Here is a basic summary:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a DLL project. </li>
<li>Create a class that implements the IWebServiceExtension interface. </li>
<li>Subscribe to events in the OnLoad() function. </li>
<li>Write your event handler logic. </li>
<li>Set your &lt;extensionType&gt; to WebService in the .vcet.config file. </li>
<li>Deploy to the ProgramData folder. </li>
</ol> 
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #ff5a00;" />
<p><strong>Scenario 2:&#0160; Vault Explorer scope</strong></p>
<p>Let&#39;s say you only care about events within your Vault Explorer plug-in.&#0160; For example, you have a custom command or tab view that needs to know about these events.&#0160; The steps are different in this case:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open up the DLL project for your Vault Extension. </li>
<li>Do not implement the IWebServiceExtension interface. </li>
<li>Subscribe to events in the OnStartup() function for your IExplorer implmentation. </li>
<li>Write your event handler logic. </li>
<li>Your &lt;extensionType&gt; is still VaultClient in the .vcet.config file.&#0160; No changes or additions are needed. </li>
<li>Deployment is still to the ProgramData folder.&#0160; Again, no changes. </li>
</ol> 
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #ff5a00;" />
<p><strong>Scenario 3:&#0160; CAD application scope using a plug-in</strong></p>
<p>If you are plugging into a CAD app, the steps are very similar to scenario 2.&#0160; The main difference is that your plug-in will have a different set of rules on how to set up and deploy.&#0160; Here are the steps, at a high level:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open up the project for your CAD plug-in. </li>
<li>Do not implement the IWebServiceExtension interface. </li>
<li>During startup, subscribe to the web service events from the Vault API.&#0160; This assumes that the CAD API framework lets your code run during startup. </li>
<li>Write your event handler logic. </li>
<li>Deploy according to the rules of the CAD framework. </li>
</ol>
<p>This technique will allow you to hook to all the Vault web service events for that CAD application, even if another plug-in fired them.&#0160; For example, you can write your own AutoCAD plug-in which responds to events from the default Vault plug-in.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #ff5a00;" />
<p><strong>Scenario 4:&#0160; &quot;Application X&quot; scope without using a plug-in</strong></p>
<p>If you want to scope your event to an application, but you can&#39;t write a plug-in, there is still an option.&#0160; All you need to do is follow scenario 1.&#0160; In step 4, when you are writing your event handler logic, check the name of the running process.&#0160; If it&#39;s not an application you want events from, exit the function.</p>
<p>There is no perfect way I know of to get the name of the current process.&#0160; The safest ways is probably to can use the first value from System.Environment.GetCommandLineArgs() to find the application name.&#0160; You can also use System.Diagnostics.Process.GetCurrentProcess().ProcessName, but it might throw security exceptions depending on the user permissions.&#0160; System.Windows.Forms.Application.ExecutablePath is also unreliable because it only works for Windowed applications.</p>
<p>The nice thing about this technique is that you can allow multiple applications.&#0160; Or you could use it to <em>exclude</em> specific applications.&#0160; For example, you exit the event handler if the application name is &quot;JobProcessor.exe&quot;.</p>

BODY:
<p><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/Concepts3.png" /></p>
<p>Some people have noticed that there is a new job queue column called Priority.&#0160; This is an API feature, at least for now.&#0160; So you have to use custom programming if you want to make use of this value.&#0160; From Vault Explorer, you can see the value, but you can&#39;t do anything with it.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2011/Priority.png" /></p>
<p>Let me start by explaining how NOT to use the priority feature:</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" width="470">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="470">You have 3 tasks (A, B and C) which you want to complete in order.&#0160; So you queue up all three jobs at once, giving A a priority of 1, B a priority of 2 and C a priority of 3.&#0160; Now you are guaranteed that they will get executed in order, right?         <br /> <br /><span style="color: #ff0000; font-size: x-large;">Wrong           <br /></span> <br />Because there may be multiple Job Processors running and because Job Processors can be specialized by type, you are not guaranteed the order.&#0160; It&#39;s technically possible for C to get executed first, with B second and A last.&#0160; Or any other permutation.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Now let&#39;s move on to the intended use:</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" width="470">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="470">You are doing a batch operation using the job queue.&#0160; This operation will take several days, involving thousands on jobs on the queue.&#0160; In the meantime, the vault is still in use by end users.&#0160; You want don&#39;t want the batch operations to interfere with user-driven operations.&#0160; So you queue the batch jobs with a low priority while user jobs get a high priority.         <br /> <br /><span style="color: #008000; font-size: x-large;">Correct           <br /></span> <br />The priority feature lets you move jobs to the front of the line if needed.&#0160; Likewise, you can indicate jobs that should run in the background.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The way it works is pretty basic.&#0160; The priority value is an integer.&#0160; The lower the number, the higher priority, with 1 being the highest possible priority.&#0160; When the Job Processor reserves a job, it will reserve the job with the lowest priority for a type that the Job Processor supports.&#0160; If there are 2 jobs with the same priority on the queue, then the first one added is the first one processed.</p>
<p>Jobs with types that are not supported by a Job Processors are basically invisible to that process.&#0160; So the priority is based on only visible jobs.&#0160; For example, the Job queue consists of job A (priority 1) and job B (priority 7).&#0160; The Job Processor supports only type B.&#0160; The result is that job B is read off the queue next.&#0160; Job A will not get processed by this Job Processor since it is a unsupported type.</p>
<p>When deciding what priority your custom jobs should have, it helps to have some context.&#0160; Vault Explorer and the CAD plug-ins use 10 as the default priority value for jobs.&#0160; Autoloader uses priority 100 when it queues jobs.&#0160; Jobs triggered automatically via a lifecycle state change are also queued as priority 100.</p>
<p>Once a job is on the queue, it&#39;s priority cannot be changed.&#0160; The workaround is to remove it from the queue and re-add it with a different priority.&#0160; This can easily be done through the API, but there is currently no UI command to do this task.</p>

<p>Normally I don&#39;t comment on <a href="http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20110629005584/en/Autodesk-Vault-Works-Microsoft-SharePoint-2010-Provide">press releases</a> or <a href="http://underthehood-autodesk.typepad.com/blog/2011/06/new-videos-autodesk-vault-and-microsoft-sharepoint-2010-integration.html">demo videos</a>, but the SharePoint integration is different.&#0160; I was personally involved in this project, so I&#39;d like to share some of the technical details.</p>
<p><strong>The Project:</strong></p>
<p>This integration was a joint effort between Autodesk and Microsoft.&#0160; Overall, I loved working with the Microsoft team.&#0160; After all, my last name <em>is</em> Redmond.&#0160; They helped develop some of the features and were great at getting me up to speed on SharePoint development.</p>
<p><strong>The Architecture:</strong></p>
<p>The Vault integration is built on a SharePoint API piece called Business Connectivity Services (BCS).&#0160; The quick definition is that BCS makes data from an outside system look like SharePoint data so that the SharePoint framework can work with it.&#0160; In this case, Vault is the outside system.</p>
<p>The Vault integration contains no web parts.&#0160; Everything is done through BCS and standard SharePoint components.&#0160; This means that the Vault data can hook into existing SharePoint features.&#0160; As shown in the videos, this feature hooks into the list and workflow features.&#0160; The end users may not even realize that they are working with Vault data.</p>
<p><strong>Making it Your Own:</strong></p>
<p>Autodesk Vault for SharePoint 2010 comes with some basic functionality out of the box.&#0160; But the real power will probably come from customizations.&#0160; SharePoint has a dizzying amount of customization features from simple to complex.&#0160; By using BCS technology, Vault data can hook into many types of customizations, from basic lists to complex web parts.</p>

Hi Doug,

 Is it possible to publish from Vault to a sharepoint server that is hosted externally (i.e. on Office365.com)?

Thanks!

I should have clarified that this integration with SharePoint 2010 has nothing to do with the existing "Publish to SharePoint" feature in Vault Explorer.

Publish to SharePoint creates a copy of Vault files which gets uploaded to SharePoint.  The new BCS integration doesn't copy anything.  It just provides a view into Vault data from the SharePoint UI.

Anyway, the BCS component will not work with an externally hosted SharePoint, which has restrictions on third-party software.
I'm not sure about the publish to SharePoint command.

I'm not sure what you are asking.  Are you saying that you want Federated Search to return the results as a SharePoint grid?
That's not possible.  The SharePoint search framework doesn't work that way.

The closest workaround is to use the "search" view on the vault lists.  When you modify the view one of the filter options is a search string.  This is useful if you want to run the same search over and over and display the results as a list.

I just had a demo of Vault from Autodesk and we currently use SharePoint 2010. The way they positioned the Vault product was as a replacement for SharePoint. Is this true?

The Federated Search does not use BCS.  The search results are based on the Vault user that SharePoint uses to communicate with Vault.

<p>Anyway, I&#39;ve updated Link Maestro to work with Vault 2012.&#0160; The &quot;Copy Link&quot; command in Vault 2011 has been renamed to &quot;Copy Hyperlink&quot; in Vault 2012, so my app is now called Hyperlink Maestro.</p>
<p>This version contains all the cool features from <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2011/01/link-maestro.html">version 1</a> (web client hyperlinks, multisite hyperlinks, etc).&#0160; Plus, I added a new feature:&#0160; <strong>HTML formatted hyperlinks</strong>.</p>

No you can't modify the export function.  However, if you are a programmer, you can write a tool that edits the .csv file once it's written.

Can't find info about format of links to ojects (ex.Items) in webclient.
Let say we do know name of server, name of vault and Item Number. is it enough to generate direct url?
I see the way to gnerate search based url
<a href="http://SERVER_NAME/AutodeskDM/webclient/AdvancedSearchForm.aspx?SearchType=items&SearchText=ITEM_NUMBER">http://SERVER_NAME/AutodeskDM/webclient/AdvancedSearchForm.aspx?SearchType=items&SearchText=ITEM_NUMBER</a>
but to use it user should choose the particular vault manually.
Is there any better name?

Doug,

Is there a version of this that works with 2013?  Specifically we are looking for a way to link a watermarked ITEM to our ERP Inventory system.  We want anyone searching a part number to see the Item in Vault in whatever it's current lifecycle state is.

<p>If you are working with custom Vault Explorer commands or tabs, then you probably deal with <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2010/12/selection-sets-in-vault-explorer.html" target="_blank">selection sets</a>.&#0160; Vault 2012 adds some cool new features to make your customizations even better.</p>
<p>There is a new SelectionTypeId value in Vault 2012.&#0160; It&#39;s called FileVersion, and if it&#39;s in the selection set, it means that a specific version of a file has been selected.&#0160; Don&#39;t confuse this with SelectionTypeId.File, which means a file is selected, but you don&#39;t know the version.</p>
<p>Files in the main grid will have SelectionTypeId.File, whereas selections in the history tab will show up as SelectionTypeId.FileVersion.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2011/SelectionSets2012/FileSelections.png" /></p>
<p>The meaning of the ID is different depending on the selection type.&#0160; For example, if you want to get the File object from the server, you will call either GetFileById or GetLatestFileByMasterId depending on the selection type.</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" width="450">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="225"><strong>TypeId</strong></td>
<td valign="top" width="225"><strong>Id meaning</strong></td>

<td valign="top" width="225">Not used</td>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>In practice, you usually want to handle both types when dealing with files.&#0160; If you have a file command, you set the type as both File and FileVersion.&#0160; When you read in a selection set, you check for both File and FileVersion entries.&#0160; See <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2011/03/google-map-extension.html" target="_blank">Google Map Extension</a> for sample code.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #ff5a00;" />
<p><strong>Links</strong></p>
<p>If you have a link to an entity, it shows up in the selection set as the entity itself.&#0160; In other words, your code has no idea it&#39;s a link.&#0160; A link to a file shows up as a file in the selection set.&#0160; Also, you can add links to folders, items and change orders.&#0160; So for a given folder, it&#39;s possible to have links to many different types of objects.&#0160; You can no longer assume that it will always be files like in Vault 2011.&#0160;</p>
<p>It&#39;s possible for a single selection set to contain a mix files, folders, items and change orders.&#0160; So you <strong>always</strong> want to check the type on the ISelection object before you do anything with the Id value.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2011/SelectionSets2012/LinkSelections.png" />&#0160; <br />In the above example, the selection set will contain 4 items, one of each entity type that can be a link target.&#0160; The rows that indicate the entity type do not show up in the selection set.</p>

First, you call GetFilesByMasterId to get the complete version history.  Next, you scan through the versions and pick a single version from each revision.  That will give you the revision history.

There are 2 main ways to pick the version for a revision.  You could just pick the one with the highest version number.  Or you could do the "released biased" view where you pick the highest version in a released state.  If there is no released state, you just pick the highest version.

Here is an article with some diagrams, which may of help.  <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2009/10/file-associations-part-2.html">http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2009/10/file-associations-part-2.html</a>

<p>This post is for cases where you come across error 303 (PermissionDenied) but are <em><strong>sure</strong></em> that your user has adequate permissions.</p>
<p>One thing you should check is the function you use to sign in.&#0160; If you are using SignInReadOnly, it may be causing the error, even if you are not calling an edit function.</p>
<p>SignInReadOnly works by signing you in with a reduced set of permissions.&#0160; As you may already know, each web service function has a permission requirement.&#0160; If your signed-in user doesn&#39;t meet that requirement, it&#39;s an error 303.</p>
<p>SignInReadOnly will remove every permission that is related to editing, but there are some cases where a Get function requires one of these permissions.&#0160; As a result, the Get fails even though it is technically a read-only function.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there is no way for you to see your active permission set.&#0160; AdminService.GetPermissionsByUserId(..) will only tell you your permission set under normal sign in conditions.&#0160; The best thing you can do is try a regular sign in and see if that fixes things.</p>

Hi Doug,

I'm fairly new to the Vault API; (having previously worked with AutoCAD, and more recently Inventor) Do you have a definitive list of "Must-have" Addins for Vault - things you can't do without and recommend for users old & new?

Thanks,

Alex.

Good question.  You can see a full list of apps from the sitemap link at the top of the page.

Effective Folder Permissions is one I would consider a must-have for Vault administrators.

Beyond that, there are apps that are must-have in specialized cases (Q-Tools), but are not as useful to the generic Vault install.  There are also a bunch of apps that I think are cool (Watch Folder, Link Maestro, Vault Gadget) but I'm not sure if they are must-have.

I recommend scanning through the list of apps and seeing which ones seem useful to you.  I'd love to hear your feedback.

I assume you mean .idw files.  And yes, if the .idw files have DWFs associated with them, it should be able to run the compare.

Any Chances to have this lovely app migrated to 2014?

Doug,

Noticed that the Drawing Compare App (and the original drawing compare function in Autodesk Design Review) has a limitation of not being able to compare tabular data and metadata.  I assume that also means that neither will catch metadata that is listed as text on the drawing itself (not just the property in the DWF)?

I don't know offhand.  You will have to test it out yourself.  But you are probably right that the feature is not supported.

<p><strong>Update</strong>:&#0160; The 2013 version is available from the <a href="http://apps.exchange.autodesk.com/VLTC/Home/Index" target="_self">Vault App Store</a>.</p>
<p>Design Review has this cool feature where you can compare drawings.&#0160; Through the magic of API programming, Jan Liska from Autodesk Consulting has hooked this functionality to Vault.&#0160; The tool is called Drawing Compare and it easily lets you compare two drawings or two versions or revisions of a drawing from within Vault.&#0160;&#0160;</p>

I have wanted such a functionality for a long time..
Seems to work great on file revisions.

But I just have to ask. Could you tweak a version to work with versions as well? (For comparing when not using revisions, and for comparing item revisions)

This is a great feature, very important to analyze and compare drawings.

This feature work with only revisions scheme? If work with version too will be cool, is possible?

I agree with the above, will be extremely handy for pre-release drawings. Management of pre-released files (including revision tables) is just as important as released ones.

Works well except my additions and deletions show as red and a dashed square instead of red and green.  Are there options to control these?

Is it possible to compare 2 DWFx? all my files are published as DWFx for IE clients.

<p>Recently there have been some hotfixes released to address Vault 2012 API issues.</p>
<p><a href="http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/ps/dl/item?siteID=123112&amp;id=17136349&amp;linkID=9261341" target="_blank">API Log In Hotfix</a> <br />This gives you a new Autodesk.Connectivity.WebServicesTools.dll which contains a WebServiceManager that doesn&#39;t log out at incorrect times.&#0160; I still recommend using the <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2011/04/issues-with-the-vault-2012-api.html" target="_blank">bugfix credential classes</a> because, if there are multiple extensions, some of them may contain the old DLL.&#0160; There is no way know which version of WebServicesTools gets loaded at runtime.</p>
<p>Because the SDK is distributed as an installer, the hotfix updates that installer.&#0160; You need to re-install your SDK to get the updated DLL.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #ff0000;" />
<p><a href="http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/ps/dl/item?siteID=123112&amp;id=17171058&amp;linkID=9261341" target="_blank">API Working Folder Hotfix</a> <br />IExplorerUtil had an issue with the GetWorkingFolder function which caused it to return the incorrect path.&#0160; That issue had a ripple effect causing GetLocalFileStatus and DownloadFile(File, Folder) to also be incorrect.&#0160; This hotfix corrects the problem, so all 3 functions should work properly now.</p>
<p>The fix is in one of the Vault Explorer DLLs.&#0160; The SDK itself does not get updated.&#0160; If you are using IExplorerUtil, you do not need to change anything, nor do you need to re-compile code.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe it&#39;s hard to update your code to the Vault 2012API, but it&#39;s something that needs to be done.&#0160; And in this day and age, if it&#39;s worth doing, it&#39;s worth making a video and posting it online.&#0160; So here it is, a video of me updating a Vault 2011 application to the Vault 2012 API.&#0160;</p>
<p><a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/Videos/updatingToVault2012.wmv" title="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/Videos/updatingToVault2012.wmv">http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/Videos/updatingToVault2012.wmv</a></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #810116;" />
<p>NOTE:&#0160; The app in the video is Effective Folder Permissions, which I was planning on updating myself.&#0160; However someone else beat me to it, so the code in the video is not the code used by <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2011/05/effective-folder-permissions-3.html" target="_blank">Effective Folder Permissions 3</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Updated for Vault 2012</strong>: New image types are now supported for thumbnails.&#0160; In Vault 2011 and earlier, Metafile was the only image type.&#0160; In Vault 2012, anything that can be streamed into System.Drawing.Image is supported.&#0160;</p>
<p>This post contains the updated code.&#0160; <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2009/09/viewing-thumbnails.html" target="_blank">The old code can be found here</a>.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #ff5a00;" />
<p>Basically there are two possible algorithms, and you don&#39;t know which one to use upfront.&#0160; So the code tries one algorithm.&#0160; If it fails, the second algorithm is run.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/SampleApp2.png" /></p>
<p>Update:&#0160; The <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2012/08/project-thunderdome-2013.html" target="_self">2013 version</a> is available.</p>
<p>Here is the new version of <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2010/11/project-thunderdome.html" target="_blank">Project Thunderdome</a>.&#0160; It&#39;s mostly the same app as before, but now updated to work with Vault 2012.</p>
<p>It still pulls down updates.<img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2010/Thunderdome/UpdatesFound.png" /></p>
<p>It still has the &quot;Users Folder&quot; concept.   <br /><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2010/Thunderdome/UsersFolder-normal.png" /></p>
<p>And you can still backup your settings.   <br /><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2010/Thunderdome/backupCommand.png" /></p>
<p>There are some minor fixes.&#0160; For example, if an extension gets installed, a menu reset is performed.&#0160;</p>
<p>If you have a Web Service event handler, Project Thunderdome can pull that down too.&#0160; Vault 2012 has the concept of an <strong>Extension</strong>, which encompasses both custom commands and web service command event handlers.&#0160; Thunderdome will pull down an extension, regardless of type.</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p><strong>Requirements:</strong> <br />Vault Workgroup/Collaboration/Professional 2012</p>
<p><a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/Apps/Thunderdome/ProjectThunderdome-2.0.2.0-bin.zip" target="_blank">Click here to download application</a> <br /><a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/Apps/Thunderdome/ProjectThunderdome-2.0.2.0-src.zip" target="_blank">Click here to download source</a></p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong>&#0160; The tool has been updated to fix an issue where settings files were being set as read-only.&#0160; The links above are to version, 2.0.2.0, which has the fix.</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p><strong>Upgrading from Vault 2011</strong></p>
<p>The settings are different from Vault 2011 and Vault 2012.&#0160; So if you are pushing out settings and extensions, make sure they are synced to Vault 2012.</p>
<p>Likewise if you have saved settings, you will might want to clear those out and re-save with your Vault 2012 settings.</p>

Doug,

I'm trying to set this up, but i get the following message when I try to backup my settings. <a href="http://screencast.com/t/ef6BICOMrjy">http://screencast.com/t/ef6BICOMrjy</a>

Also if i backup my settings, as Administrator, and then try to copy those settings to the Default folder, then this will create duplicate file names in Vault. How do you get around this?

Cheers

Scott

Error 1058 is UniqueFileNameRequiredViolated, which means you have the "Enforce Unique File Names" setting turned on and you tried to add a file with the same name as another file in the Vault.

Basically, the backup feature in Thunderdome is not compatible with the Unique File Name feature.  The reason is that everyone's backup files will have the same name.  
The only options are either turn off the Unique File Name feature or don't use the backup command in Thunderdome.

Ok but doesn't that mean I can't push the config settings to the users at all? Simply because the same filename would exist in each user folder....

You can still push settings as long as each file has a unique name.  The push goes directly from the default folder to the user's local folder.  The user does not need their own Vault folder in order for the push to work.

my confusion is this: the ViewStyles.xml file would have the same file name for every user, therefore duplicating the file throughout the user folders from one user to the next.

ViewStyles.xml would live in Vault under Thunderdome's "default" folder.  That would be the only place that file exists in Vault.  When Thunderdome pushes the file to users, ViewStyles gets downloaded directly to the client computer (for example, somewhere under C:\Users\myusername\AppData\Roaming).

So each user will have a copy of ViewStyles on their own computer, but this is fine since there is only one copy in Vault.

Ok great, cheers for clarifying.

I have noticed the add-in has created a folder for each user that is enabled in Vault. Are these folders created upon install of the add-in? I just can't remember if its as a result of trying to run the backup or not.

Also when you select don't ask me again (re, syncing the profile data) how do you get it to ask again or sync again at a later date? Do you have to reinstall the add-in?

cheers for you help doug

If you go to the location of the vault extension (%programData%\Autodesk\Vault 2012\Extensions\ProjectThunderdome) there should be a readme file explaining how to get that dialog back. 

The quick answer is to delete the "settings.xml" file from the ProjectThunderdome folder.

cheers doug. I was wondering if there was a Readme, I should have thought about looking there before hand.

<p>Here is how you can solve the &quot;Four Eyes&quot; problem with the new events feature in the API.&#0160; First, I should define the Four Eyes so we are all on the same page.</p>
<p><strong>The Four Eyes Problem:     <br /></strong>Anyone on the Engineering group can change the lifecycle state of a file from &quot;Work In Progress&quot; to &quot;For Review&quot;.&#0160; Any engineer can also change the lifecycle state from &quot;For Review&quot; to &quot;Released&quot;.&#0160; However, you don&#39;t want the same person to do both these transitions for a given file.&#0160; In other words, you want &quot;four eyes&quot; to see the file before it gets released.</p>
<p>Using the default Vault features, you can&#39;t solve the problem.&#0160; But with events, you can.&#0160; By hooking to the UpdateFileLifecycleStateEvents event, you can check the file history and add a restriction if you detect only &quot;two eyes&quot; on the file.</p>

<p>I was going to just paste the code in-line with this post, but it turned out to be more code than I expected.&#0160; This is one of those things that the human brain has no problem with, but it takes a huge amount of work to put it into computer terms.&#0160; I can&#39;t complain though since that&#39;s how I stay employed.</p>

<p>Aside from the large amount of code, there are a few other ugly, yet unavoidable, aspects to this solution.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Redundant API calls</strong> - It would be nice to save off the reviewState and releaseState LfCycDef objects once we look them up.&#0160; We can&#39;t do that because we can&#39;t assume we are communicating with the same server or vault between events.&#0160; So, we are forced to look up the LfCycDef objects each time.</li>
<li><strong>Requires consecutive versions</strong> - There is no easy way to pinpoint which version is the one with the lifecycle state change.&#0160; We are forced to order all the versions and cycle through the set.&#0160; We compare version N with version N-1 and see if the lifecycle state is different.&#0160; If a purge creates gaps in the version history, it may be impossible to figure out who changed the state on the file.</li>
<li><strong>File.FileLfCyc.LfCycStateId and File.FileLfCyc.LfCycStateName</strong> - This one tricks me every time I run into it.&#0160; The LfCycStateId has the lifecycle state ID of the <em><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">latest</span></strong></em> file in the revision.&#0160; The LfCycStateName has the lifecycle state name of the <em><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">current</span></strong></em> file version.&#0160; That&#39;s why the code compares state name instead of the ID.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Update:</strong>&#0160; There is <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMqn_kSlHH8&amp;feature=player_profilepage" target="_self">a great video</a> explaining the end-user experience of this feature.&#0160; Contine reading for the technical details that make this feature possible.</p>
<p>File Associations have gone through some changes for Vault 2012.&#0160; Most of the changes are around a new feature which I will refer to as <strong>File Resolution</strong>.&#0160; Basically, the feature is about fixing up broken file references if a file is moved or renamed.</p>
<p>To enable this feature, we needed to add extra meta-data to file associations.&#0160; This meta-data is used to A) detect when a reference is broken and B) provide information necessary to fix the reference.</p>
<p>The first change you will notice is that AddFile and CheckinFile methods are different.&#0160; Instead of passing in 4 parameters (dependFileIds, dependSources, attachFileIds, attachSources) related to file associations, there is now only 1 parameter (associations).&#0160;</p>
<p>The association parameter is an array of FileAssocParam objects.&#0160; The FileAssocParam class contains the child file ID, the source meta data and the association type (attachment or dependency).&#0160; So it contains all the information from before, just in a different form.&#0160; The new pieces of information are the <strong>RefId</strong> and the <strong>ExpectedVaultPath</strong> properties.&#0160;</p>
<p>RefId is metadata indicating how to locate the reference within the parent file.&#0160; This data is file-type specific and is not something you want to set yourself.&#0160; The CAD plug-in will set this up when files are added in.&#0160; If you are doing an update, you need to re-specify the associations at check in, so just pass in the RefIds from the associations on the previous version.</p>
<p>ExpectedVaultPath is the vault location of the child file.&#0160; This piece is used to detect when moves or renames happen.&#0160; The word <em>expected</em> is there because you can never be 100% sure of that location.&#0160; Because Vault is a multi-user environment, it&#39;s possible that someone else renamed that child right before you do yout check-in.&#0160; The system is architected so that you don&#39;t need to know the exact path at the moment of check-in.&#0160; You just need to know the path that the parent is <em>expecting</em> the child to be in.&#0160; The File Resolve framework will do the rest.</p>
<p>If you are reading file associations on existing file, there some new parameters on FileAssoc.&#0160; The ExpectedVaultPath shows up here.&#0160; There is also a new property called VaultPathChanged.&#0160; This property is a boolean that indicates that broken reference has been found.&#0160; If the current Vault path is not equal to the expected Vault path for either the parent or the child, the value will be TRUE.&#0160;</p>
<p>When broken references are detected, components called Resolvers are in charge of fixing up the references.&#0160; Resolvers run <strong>client-side</strong> and are file-type specific.&#0160; Currently we only have resolvers for AutoCAD, Inventor and Navisworks files.&#0160; All other files cannot participate in the file resolution feature.</p>
<p>A Resolver is not something you should be dealing with directly. The new utility Autodesk.Connectivity.Explorer.ExtensibilityTools.IExplorerUtil contains DownloadFile() functions that will do the download and run the Resolver.&#0160; However, the older function Autodesk.Connectivity.WebServices.DocumentService.DownloadFile() will <strong>not</strong> run the resolver.&#0160; The reason is that the WebServices DLL is about server communication, not client-side operations.&#0160;</p>
<p>If you used checksum in the past to locate files, that&#39;s no longer a good mechanism.&#0160; Because the files are modified client-side, the checksum will no longer match the Vault checksum.&#0160; So you need to use things like filename, path, and last modified date to match between local and Vault files.&#0160; If you feel you absolutely need checksum capability, let me know and I will find you a workaround.</p>
<p>The File Resolution feature is a difficult one to consume from an API standpoint, but the end user experience is a very positive one.&#0160; In earlier versions of vault it was very difficult for a user to move and rename files, especially if a file was used in many places.&#0160; Under the new model, files can be easily and quickly moved and renamed.</p>

Hi Doug,

But if we are importing dwg's with xrefs in bulk using the SDK, what value for RefId would we set, so AutoCAD can resolve broken xref links?

And would ExpectedVaultPath be the path to the file, or the path to the folder the file is in?

Thanks in advance

Officially, the best way to add AutoCAD data is through the AutoCAD plug-in or Autoloader.

That being said, I believe that the xref block name is the RefId.  You can test this out by adding DWGs through the plug-in then reading the FileAssoc data through the Vault API.

Expected Vault Path is the full Vault path, folder and file name.  Example:  "$/folderA/fileB.dwg"

Hi Doug,

I have checked the RefID and it is not the xref block name. It is a number but it is not equal to the FileID or the MasterID of the xref DWG or parent DWG. And i can not see what kind of number it is yet.

Do you have any other ideas to look for?

Thanks in advanced!

I am moving from Vault 2011 to Vault 2013 Basic.  I build brand new Inventor assemblies through the API, so I don't have a previous version to get the RefID from.  How can I set the RefID?  If I set it to nothing, I lose the resolution feature, right?

<p>I&#39;m seeing a lot of people having issues loading their Vault 2012 extension, so here is an updated deployment checklist.&#0160; The <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2011/01/custom-command-deployment-checklist.html" target="_blank">2011 version of the checklist is here</a>.&#0160;</p>
<p>For all extension types (custom commands/tabs, job handlers, event handlers):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Is your project </strong><strong>using .NET 3.5 or earlier?       <br /></strong>(<em>.NET 4.0 is not supported for extensions. <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2011/02/net-40.html" target="_self">Click here for instructions</a></em>.) </li>
<li><strong>Are you using Vault Workgroup, Collaboration or Professional? </strong> <br />(<em>extensions are not available in base Vault</em>) </li>
<li><strong>Did you deploy to %ProgramData%\Autodesk\Vault 2012\Extensions\[myExtension]? </strong></li>
<li><strong>Did you include a .vcet.config file? </strong></li>
<li><strong>Does the .vcet.config file have the correct Assembly name? </strong> <br />(<em>it should be your DLL name without the &quot;.dll&quot; at the end</em>) </li>
<li><strong>Does the .vcet.config file have the correct Extension Type? </strong></li>
<li><strong>Does your extension have values set for AssemblyCompany, AssemblyProduct, AssemblyDescription, ApiVersion and ExtensionId assembly attributes? </strong></li>
<li><strong>Do you have &quot;4.0&quot; as the attribute value for ApiVersion?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Does your IExtension, IJobHandler or IWebServiceExtension implementation have a public default constructor? </strong> <br />(<em>a default constructor is a constructor with no arguments, if no constructor is in the code, the compiler will create one</em>) </li>
</ul>
<p>Custom commands only:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Did you reset your menus in Vault Explorer? </strong> <br />(<em>either delete Menus.xml or right-click on the menu bar and select Customize</em>) </li>
<li><strong>Do your CommandSite objects have non-empty Label values? </strong> <br />(<em>the label can&#39;t be null or empty, even if you are not displaying a sub menu</em>) </li>
</ul>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p><strong>Testing the load:</strong></p>
<p>If you are still having trouble, I wrote a test loader that you can use.&#0160; It will display more detailed information about why you extension is not loading.</p>

Hi!
The problem with the validation check (we are talking JobServer)  is that it checks every file in the directory. Autodesk should change it to just check the mentioned file in the .vcet.config-file and not any relatives. I’ve been struggling the whole day and the reason was a dll from a third party supplier that I needed.

By the way, thanks for your program, it helped me in the right direction, after 8 hours I feel relieved.

The .NET framework is what is pulling in all the referenced DLLs.  I don't think JobProcessor.exe itself is trying to load every file in the directory.

Anyway, good to know things are working for you now.

Hi Doug,

I am trying to build the PropertyPageSample app.  I am getting the "Error loading extension PropertyPageSample" error on starting Vault.

I tried running the Load Tester utility, and it said that it could not find the  Autodesk.Connectivity.Extensibility.Framework version 16.0.56.200.  I checked my project References and I had that DLL, but it was version 16.1.58.0.

Is that really the problem?  How should I approach fixing it?

Hotfixes should not affect API applications.  They don't have strong names, so you should be able to swap in different versions without causing errors.

Anyway, post your app to the Vault customization discussion group and I'll take a look:

Vault 2013 has an error logging feature.  So, I'm hoping that a 2013 test loader isn't needed.

<p>In Vault 2012, the shares feature has finally been removed.&#0160; We&#39;ve been slowly deprecating it over the past few releases, but now it&#39;s final.&#0160; A new feature, links, has been added as a replacement feature.</p>
<p>In case you are not familiar with shares, it was a feature that allowed a file to live equally in multiple folders.&#0160; This was a big pain to deal with in code because you couldn&#39;t assume that a file had a single location.&#0160; In Vault 2012, you don&#39;t have to worry any more.&#0160; <strong>A file lives in one and only one folder, always.</strong></p>
<p>The new feature, links, is an object that points to a file in another location.&#0160; It&#39;s very similar to Windows shortcuts.&#0160; So even though a file has only one true location, there can be many links to it that live in other folders.</p>
<p>Files are not the only thing you can link to either.&#0160; Folders, items and change orders can have links too.&#0160; So you can use it to organize your items into folders or crate project folders containing all the relevant objects.</p>
<p>When you migrate to Vault 2012 from a previous release, any existing shares get converted to links.&#0160; The oldest folder location is chosen as the true location of the file.&#0160; Any other folder locations become links to the file.&#0160;</p>
<p>Links can only be created in Vault Workgroup and above, but because of legacy data, it may be possible for links to show up in the basic version of Vault.</p>
<p>At the API level, the code is still structured around shares.&#0160; For example, GetFoldersByFileMasterId returns an array of Folders even though the array will always have 1 element in 2012.&#0160; And DeleteFileFromFolder has you pass in a folder ID even though there is no reason to.</p>
<p>The API functions that deal with Links are pretty straightforward.&#0160; DocumentService.AddLink() adds the link.&#0160; DocumentService.GetLinksByFolderIds() gets the links for a given set of folders.</p>
<p>DocumentService.FindLinksBySearchConditions() is especially cool because it allows you to search for links.&#0160; Technically, the property conditions are searching on the thing that the link points to, but the results are in link form.&#0160; However, any folder information passed in will be applied to the link locations, not the original file locations. There are some creative uses for this feature.&#0160; For example, you can search for all items within a folder.</p>

Hi, nice post, but I have a problem with this function, I not sure if I understand correct this function.

The argument parentIds what parrent refer, the entity were the link lives or the file parent, 

for instance I have entity person, and cars, so the entity person have links to cars, for instance

Person 1 (lnk_car1, lnk_Car2, lnk_car3)
Person 2 (lnk_car3, lnk_car4)

Like you see person 1 and 2 share a car.

Ok, need to run a search to get all blue car, (all files represented the image(jpg) of a car an have a custom property color)

But need to run this search to only get car for the person 1, soy I suppose parentId is the person 1 id? then the serach only search for links inside person 1?

If I test this, I get a 1000 error code

can you give me some light here?

thanks,

<p>Keep in mind I don&#39;t know <em>when</em> I&#39;ll be upgrading any of these apps.&#0160; Sometime before the next Vault release is as specific as I can get right now.</p>
<p><strong>My proposed solution</strong></p>
<p>One of the main reasons that I posted the source code to all the apps is so that I wouldn&#39;t be solely responsible for things like bug fixes, new features and upgrades.&#0160; I&#39;m perfectly fine with other people making the needed updates.&#0160;</p>
<p>Here are the basic steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Update the app. </li>
<li>Remove all the Autodesk copyright/legal stuff.&#0160; Replace with your own copyright/legal stuff if you want. </li>
<li>Remove the OnesAndZeros icon: <img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/OnesAndZeros.png" /> </li>
<li>Increase the version number. </li>
<li>Update the readme. </li>
<li>Post the app somewhere. </li>
<li>Tell me where you posted the app, and I&#39;ll link to it from this blog.&#0160; The app itself, will not be hosted here. </li>
</ol>
<p>The basic idea is that when you update the app, it becomes <em>yours</em>, not <em>mine</em>.&#0160;</p>
<p><strong>Rejected solutions:</strong></p>
<p>A couple of people suggested using online development sites like SourceForge or CodePlex.&#0160; Those sites are fine, but I don&#39;t want to be the one managing it.&#0160; If I did, that would be yet one more site that I would be running, and I don&#39;t have the time.&#0160; Feel free to set up a site on your own, and I will be happy to link to it.&#0160; I just don&#39;t want to <em>run</em> the site.</p>
<p>Submitting an updated project to me also won&#39;t work.&#0160; I don&#39;t have time to review other people&#39;s changes.&#0160; In many ways, reviewing code takes longer than just doing the update myself.&#0160; At least when I write the update, I know exactly what changed.</p>
<p><strong>Other ideas:</strong></p>
<p>If you have any other suggestions, let me know in the comments section below.&#0160;</p>

One of your developers wrote a routine to "getfoldersctructure" to re-populate the local workspace with the folder structure from the vault. This is brilliant! Can it be found, re-compiled for 2012 and uploaded?

Thanks, Dave

I have updated the Effective Folder permissions to work with Vault 2012 and I have added a couple of new features.  You can now toggle between seeing the permissions for groups and users and clicking on one of the permission icons will open up a pop up box allowing you to modify the permissions.

I've tried my best to remove all onesandzeros/Autodesk copyright information as you requested.  I did however leave the copyright info in the Credentials_bugfix file.  Should I remove it from there as well?

Wow.  Thanks for doing this.  
Keeping the copyright information in the bugfix file is fine with me.  I have some other comments, but I will make them in the codeplex forums.

<p>The service manager concept has been around for a while.&#0160; Almost every SDK and blog sample has one.&#0160; For Vault 2012, we decided to build it into the API.&#0160; It&#39;s a bit tricky to get used to at first.&#0160; But once you get the hang of it, you&#39;ll love it.</p>
<p><strong>WebServiceManager features:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Login management</strong> - It will handle the login and logout for you so you don&#39;t have to. </li>
<li><strong>Service creation</strong> - The WebServiceManager is a factory, so it will create all your services for you.&#0160; You don&#39;t have to worry about calling new, setting the URL or copying security headers. </li>
<li><strong>Re-SignIn</strong> - If you run into error 300, which means your login has been invalidated, the WebServiceManager will automatically catch the error, sign-in again, re-run the command, and return the new result.&#0160; This feature is only available if you use a credentials class that supports sign in. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How to use      <br /></strong>The WebServiceManager can be found in Autodesk.Connectivity.WebServicesTools.dll.&#0160; As the name implies, it contains tools to help you use the web services.&#0160; Currently, the WebServiceManager is the main component of the DLL.</p>
<p>To create a WebServiceManager, you need to provide it with <strong>credentials</strong>, which tells the manager how to log in and log out of Vault.&#0160; There are several credentials classes available, so you need to use the appropriate one.&#0160; It usually is based on the information you have available.&#0160; For example, if you have the username and password, you would use the UserPasswordCredentials.&#0160; If you are in a custom command, and a context is passed in, you can use the UserIdTicketCredentials.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:&#0160; There are some known issues with UserIdTicketCredentials and WebServiceCredentials, so <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2011/04/issues-with-the-vault-2012-api.html" target="_blank">read this article first</a> before using.</strong></p>
<p>Once you have created your WebServiceManager, you are ready to start making web service calls.&#0160; It has properties for each service and each service has its full set of functions.</p>
<p>To sign out, just let WebServiceManager go out of scope.&#0160; It&#39;s an <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.idisposable.aspx" target="_blank">IDisposable</a> class, which means it does special things before it gets garbage collected.&#0160; So that&#39;s where all the sign out happens if a sign out is needed.&#0160; I recommend declaring the WebServiceManager in a using statement if possible.&#0160; That way you know when Dispose() will get called.&#0160; If it doesn&#39;t make sense to have a using statement, I recommend explicitly calling Dispose() when you are done with it.&#0160; In effect, the Dispose() replaces SignOut().</p>
<p>Since the WebServiceManager references every service, which in turn references every server function, the WebServiceManager <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>is</em></span></strong> the web services API.&#0160; You can just use a single object to make every Vault server call.</p>
<p><strong>Sample code:      <br /></strong>Here is a comparison of the old way versus the new way with the WebServiceManager.</p>

Yes, the service objects all use WSE 3.0.  However, you still need to enable MTOM by having a "microsoft.web.services3" section in the applications .config file.

The following article explains how to update the .config file and test to make sure that binary transfer is working:

The WebServiceManager supports all types of Vault logins.  The normal login will consume a license when the manager signs-in to the server, which is when new is called on WebServiceManager.

If a read-only is used, as shown in my sample code, then WebServiceManager will not consume a license.  The last parameter on the UserPasswordCredentials constructor tells if the login will be read-only or not.

<p><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/Announcements2.png" /></p>
<p>There are a couple of issues that have already been found with the latest SDK.&#0160; I want to make sure everyone knows about them upfront. <br /><br /><br /></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">UserIdTicketCredentials and WebServiceCredentials</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>&#0160;</strong>Please avoid using UserIdTicketCredentials and WebServiceCredentials in Autodesk.Connectivity.WebServicesTools.dll.&#0160; We found an issue where they log out of Vault incorrectly in certain cases.</p>
<p>If you don&#39;t know what these classes are, it&#39;s because they are new in Vault 2012.&#0160; The classes are used to provide login information to the new WebServiceManager class.</p>
<p><strong>Workaround:</strong>&#0160; The links below contain fixed versions of the classes.&#0160; Basically the logout capability has been disabled so there is no danger for accidental logout.&#0160; To use, just add the .cs or .vb&#0160; to your project and use the UserIdTicketCredentials_bugfix or WebServiceCredentials_bugfix classes in place of the normal classes.</p>
<p><a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/Files/2012Issues/Credentials_bugfix.cs" target="_blank">Click here for the C# fix</a> <br /><a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/Files/2012Issues/Credentials_bugfix.vb" target="_blank">Click here for the VB.NET fix</a></p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p><strong>&#0160;</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Menu resets still needed for custom commands </span></strong></p>
<p>I had this fixed.&#0160; I swear.&#0160; Unfortunately, something happened between my fix and the final release.&#0160; So when you deploy new Vault Explorer commands, you will need to reset the menus before you can see it in the menu bar.</p>
<p>The good news is that toolbars don&#39;t need a reset and menus are much more stable than they were in Vault 2011.&#0160; You should no longer see cases where the entire menu bar gets jumbled because a custom command was deployed or removed.</p>
<p><strong>Workaround:</strong>&#0160; Do a menu reset after deploying a custom command.&#0160; The reset command can be found manually by right clicking on the menu bar and running the Customize command.&#0160; Programmatically, a reset can be done by deleting the menu.xml file in <strong>%AppData%\Autodesk\[Vault Product]\Objects\Menu.xml</strong>.<br />It&#39;s the same as the Vault 2011 workaround.</p>

Will this bugfix later on come as an servicepack? 

There is also a bug in  Autodesk.Connectivity.Explorer.ExtensibilityTools.dll, i have reported it to adn: (We have logged Change Request number 1399765 with our development team as this issue requires a modification to our software) - maybe you should mention it here to.

I'm not sure if I can comment on planned hotfixes or not.  Let me put it this way, we will not be fixing the menu bar problem for Vault 2012.

I'm aware of the issue you logged, but I have not had a chance yet to look at it closely.  I'll contact you directly if I have any questions.

- Thanks

There are a couple of ways to get error 300.  

If your services are working, then start getting 300 at random times, then it may be that the server logged you out.

If your services are getting error 300 right from the start, then it's probably that the security header was never set up properly on that service.  If you use the WebServiceManager, it should set up the security header for you.

Hi <u>Doug Redmond</u>,
I'm a dotnet developer, and beginner to AutoDesk, for the past 2 months only I know about Autodesk. My task is to download the entire project(.dst) from Vault to Local path. and open it in AutoCAD. I got an old code from my higher officals but it is supported to Vault 2012. Now I'm working with Vault 2015. I made some research on some sites(including this), and found as Version Compatibility problem. And now I got some stuff(VDF) from this site and successfully downloaded too. <br>But I can't able to access the downloaded file. All It shows like encrypted characters. Why.? <br>Is there any steps to access these. ?<br>
At present I'm thinking about to edit the previous code only. Is this a good idea.? or any easy steps are there.?<br>I'm very blank idea in this, so please guide me. <br>Any help would be needful. Thanks.

Offhand, I don't know of any "encrypted characters" issues.  I suggest posing this issue to the Vault Customization group:  <a href="http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/vault-customization/bd-p/301">http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/vault-customization/bd-p/301</a>

That way you can post screenshots and source code.

<p><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/Commentary3.png" /></p>
<p>Now that I am (momentarily) out of apps to post, I&#39;d like to take some time to talk about this blog.&#0160; What are the objectives?&#0160; What is the plan for the future?&#0160; That sort of thing.</p>
<p><strong>The philosophy:      <br /></strong>This blog is 100% meat.&#0160; There is no filler for fluff.&#0160; If it&#39;s not related to Vault, it&#39;s not getting posted.&#0160; There will be no vacation photos, stories about my family, movie reviews and so on.&#0160; Some other blogs do that, and that&#39;s fine, but it&#39;s just not my style.&#0160;</p>
<p>A consistent level of posting is important too.&#0160; The formula I use is 1 posting per week and 1 sample app per month.&#0160; I&#39;ve been able to keep that pace for over a year an a half, which is a decent accomplishment in my opinion.&#0160; The downside to this approach is that there is an excess of content and certain times of the year (like now with the release of Vault 2012) and a lack of content at other times (like right before a release).&#0160; The result is a slower release information so that it lasts for the whole year.&#0160; Hopefully, you are not even aware that I&#39;m doing this.&#0160; Nevertheless, let me know if there is a topic you want me to hit sooner than later.</p>
<p>Programmers are my target audience, but I&#39;m very aware that free apps is a big draw for all types of Vault users.&#0160; The two groups are very different from each other, but I haven&#39;t heard any complaints.&#0160; Regarding programmers, I want my blog to serve the whole spectrum.&#0160; From professional software engineers to hobbyists that barely know how to code.&#0160; Not every post will hit the entire range, but overall, the blog should have something for every type of programmer.</p>
<p>My blog is just part of a network of Autodesk online content.&#0160; On the Vault side alone, there is a <a href="http://underthehood-autodesk.typepad.com/" target="_blank">usage blog</a>, <a href="http://crackingthevault.typepad.com/" target="_blank">support blog</a>, <a href="http://wikihelp.autodesk.com/Vault/" target="_blank">wiki</a> and <a href="http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/Autodesk-Vault/bd-p/101" target="_blank">discussion group</a>.&#0160; The hope is that all these pieces come together to form something positive and useful.&#0160; I try my best to fill my own little niche while adding benefit to the overall network.</p>
<p><strong>Future plans:      <br /></strong>I don&#39;t have specifics or timetables or anything like that.&#0160; But I do have some ideas bouncing around in my head that I would like to start acting on in the upcoming year.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Quick start guide:</strong>&#0160; If you are new to Vault programming, I imagine the whole thing can be overwhelming.&#0160; So I will be creating a section geared specifically for getting someone coding on Vault as quickly as possible.&#0160; It may just be a page that links to some of my old posts, or it may be something more experimental, like a video tutorial series.&#0160; I&#39;ll probably start small and grow it over time. </li>
<li><strong>Developer community:</strong>&#0160; Since my blog is the de facto place to go for Vault apps, I&#39;d like to use it as a cornerstone for a development community that extends outside Autodesk.&#0160; The trick is how to do that without sucking up too much of my time. </li>
<li><strong>Retroactive updates:</strong>&#0160; As new Vault releases obsolete my older posts, I need to go back and add addendums indicating how things have changed. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Don&#39;t change what is working:      <br /></strong>I have no intention of changing anything.&#0160; Based on all the feedback I&#39;ve received (both internal to Autodesk and external) this blog is on the right track and I should keep doing what I&#39;m doing.&#0160; I have no intention of changing my rate of posting, sample apps, webinars, level of technical detail and so on.</p>
<p><strong>Final Notes:      <br /></strong>I love what I do, and hopefully it shows with every post.&#0160; Maybe one day this blogging stuff will seem like work, but I don&#39;t think that day will come anytime soon.&#0160;</p>

<p>The worklist feature in Vault Professional is a nice feature.&#0160; It pops up information informing you of any change orders you need to take action on.&#0160; The only problem is that you need to launch the Vault Professional client to get that feature.&#0160; Chris Sawicki and <a href="http://underthehood-autodesk.typepad.com/">Brian Schanen</a> decided to change that with <strong>Vault Gadget</strong>.</p>

Doug,
Is there any secrets to making the gadget work?  I've tried everything!  and all I'm seeing is the VAULT CO WORKLIST windows with yellow lettering Could not retrieve COs Please check your gadget settings.  My settings are set and I even verified my email settings and am notified that way, but can't get the gadget to work.  It would be pretty neat if it did work.  Thanks. Joseph 
PS... yes, all my 2012 pro hotfixes have been updated

Offhand I don't have an answer, but I have heard of this before.

What is your username, server and vault name?  What are the special characters in your password?

Hi Doug,

How bout this?  User name: administrator
server: 127.0.0.1
vault name: industrial machine (I'm using it for testing purposes, it's the one Brian S. has used in his Vault classes) no special characters in the password - very simple actually, 1234abcd

Any help you might share would be truly appreciated.

Regards,

Joe B.

Here is another thing to try.

Remove the gadget from your desktop.  Go to "%localappdata%\Microsoft\Windows Sidebar\Gadgets", delete VaultCO.Gadget, download it again and deploy it again.

Let me know if that fixes it.

I still haven't been able to reproduce this issue on my end.  Can you give more details about your system?  
What is your Windows version?  Are there any special security policies in place?  Are other gadgets running?  Is anti-virus software running?  Of so what happens when you disable it?  Is there anything else different between your system and your colleague's system?

<p><strong>What is the Event feature in the Vault 2012 API?      <br /></strong>For Vault 2012, we added a feature called <strong>Web Service Command Events</strong>, which allows you to run custom code before and after certain Vault operations are executed.&#0160; For example, you can perform custom operations after a file gets checked-in.     <strong></strong></p>
<p><strong><br />What is the scope of my event handlers?      <br /></strong>Your handlers will hook to any application on that computer using Autodesk.Connectivity.WebServices.dll.&#0160; Starting in Vault 2012 all Autodesk Vault clients use this DLL for communication with the server.&#0160; So you can hook to applications like Vault Explorer, AutoCAD, Inventor, Civil 3D, and so on.     <br /> <br />Let me restate, that this feature runs <strong>client side</strong>.&#0160; So if you have 100 Vault users, your event code needs to be deployed to 100 computers in order to grab all events.     <strong></strong></p>
<p><strong><br />What Vault products does this feature work with?      <br /></strong>Vault Workgroup, Vault Collaboration and Vault Professional.&#0160; It is not available in base Vault.     <strong></strong></p>
<p><strong><br />What operations can I receive events for?      <br /></strong>Most events can be displayed in a grid:</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" width="450">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="90">&#0160;</td>
<td valign="top" width="90">File</td>

<td valign="top" width="90">Yes</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>In addition to the ones listed in the grid, you can receive events for File Download, Item Rollback Lifecycle, and Item Promote.    <strong></strong></p>
<p><strong><br />What are the events I can hook to for a given operation?      <br /></strong>Each operation fires 3 events:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>GetRestrictions</strong> - This part allows event handlers to block the operation. </li>
<li><strong>Pre</strong> - This part allows event handlers to run code before the operation takes place. </li>
<li><strong>Post</strong> - This part allows event handlers to run code after the operation has finished. </li>
</ol>
<p><strong><br />When and where do these events fire?      <br /></strong>Here is the basic timeline:     <br /><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2011/eventTimeline.png" /></p>
<p>If restrictions are found during the GetRestrictioins phase, the operation is blocked and never continues to the Pre.&#0160; If there are no restrictions, things continue to the Pre.&#0160; Unless something unexpected occurs, Pre, Web Service call and Post should always execute.</p>
<p>As you can see, the events happen around the web service call.&#0160; In other words, at the layer where the client communicates with the server.&#0160;</p>
<p>Keep in mind these events may or may not correlate with the UI command that the user invokes. For example, a user performs a Get command on a file in Vault Explorer.&#0160; This may trigger multiple download events if an entire assembly needs to be download.&#0160; Or it may trigger no events if the file on disk is up-to-date.    <strong></strong></p>
<p><strong><br />What can I do in an event handler?      <br /></strong>Inside a GetRestrictions event you can block the operation and provide the reason for the restriction.&#0160; Inside a Pre and a Post event you run extra operations, such as sending off an email or queuing up a Job.</p>
<p><strong><br />What can&#39;t I do in an event handler?      <br /></strong>You can&#39;t change the parameters to or from the operation.&#0160; You can see most of the parameters passed in, but you can&#39;t change them.&#0160; Likewise you see the return result, but you can&#39;t alter it.&#0160; For example, in the Pre AddFile event you can see that the file name parameter is &quot;Part1.dwg&quot;, your code <strong>cannot</strong> change that name to &quot;ZX-0389.dwg&quot;.     <br /> <br />You should also avoid UI in an event handler.&#0160; You don&#39;t know what context your handler is running in.&#0160; For example, you could be running in a command line utility or a service.     <br /> <br />Bubbling up exceptions is not a good idea.&#0160; Again, you don&#39;t know the context you are running in, so an exception might end up shutting down the parent application.&#0160; The safest thing is to wrap each event handler in a try/catch block.     <br /> <br />Lastly, make sure you don&#39;t create and infinite recursion of events.&#0160; For example, during a Pre AddFile event, your code adds a file, which triggers an AddFile event, which causes your code to add a file, and so on.&#0160; Even if your code works fine on its own, remember that there might be other event handlers loaded.&#0160; So your handler might run and operation that triggers another handler, which runs an operation that triggers back to your handler, and so on ad infinitum.&#0160; <strong></strong></p>
<p><strong><br />If the Vault server throws an error do I get a Post event?      <br /></strong>Yes, and you can see the Exception that is thrown.     <strong></strong></p>
<p><strong><br />Am I guaranteed a Post event?      <br /></strong>Not in all cases.&#0160; It&#39;s technically possible for the operation to complete on the server, but your computer loses power right before the Post event.&#0160; However during normal operation, yes, you will always get a Post event.     <strong></strong></p>
<p><strong><br />Is there anyway to enforce that an Event fires?      <br /></strong>No.&#0160; If the computer doesn&#39;t have your handler installed, or your hander fails to load for some reason, the operation will go through without hitting your code.     <strong></strong></p>
<p><strong><br />How do I write an event handler?      <br /></strong>A detailed list of steps can be found in the <strong>Getting Started</strong> section of the API documentation.&#0160; The <strong>RestrictOperations</strong> sample in the SDK has sample code.</p>
<p>Here are the basic steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create your DLL project </li>
<li>Reference Auotdesk.Connectivity.WebServices.dll </li>
<li>Add a class that implements IWebServiceExtension </li>
<li>In the OnLoad() implementation, hook to the events that you care about.&#0160; The hooks are on the web services objects themselves.&#0160; (ex.&#0160; DocumentService.AddFileEvents.GetRestrictions ) </li>
<li>Write the event handler code </li>
<li>Deploy </li>
</ol>
<p><strong><br />I wrote a Vault client, will event handlers be hooking to my application?      <br /></strong>If you use Autodesk.Connectivity.WebServices.dll to communicate with the Vault Server, yes.&#0160; So your code should handle cases where operations are blocked by other event handlers.&#0160; In your app, these restrictions will bubble up as an Exception of type Autodesk.Connectivity.Extensibility.Framework.ExtensionException.     <strong></strong></p>
<p><strong><br />Are my handlers specific to a version of Vault?      <br /></strong>Yes.&#0160; For example, your Vault 2012 extension can handle events from the Vault 2012 version of Autodesk.Connectivity.WebServices.dll, but not from any other version of the DLL.     <strong></strong></p>
<p><strong><br />Which Web Service functions fire which events?      <br /></strong>You can see the full mapping in the <strong>Web Service Command Event Mappings</strong> of the Knowledge Base in the Vault SDK documentation.&#0160; There are no cases where a web service function fires multiple events.     <strong></strong></p>
<p><strong><br />Are there other event types?      <br /></strong>Yes, but I&#39;ll cover those in another post.</p>

Yes you can.  You would need to catch the event, locate the Inventor file on disk, then generate the PDF or DXF based on the local file.

What are you planning on doing with the generated files?

The plan is to generate pdf or dxf files of Inventor drawings (IDW or DWG) upon check in and placed out on a network location. I understand that users can potentially view WIP files. I was wondering if it was possible. Thanks!

That should work.  I suggest generating the files after the check-in completes.  That way, if there is a failure, you don't need to waste time generating the files.

Finding the local file on disk will be a bit tricky because all you get are Vault server objects and IDs.

Hi Doug Redmond,
I want to develop a function to modify filename by some rule when file is uploaded to Vault.
After reading your article, I find a way.pls help me check.
1、subscribe the DocumentService post event
2、call CheckoutFile and CheckinFile to modify filename.
Is these step talked above right?
pls. correct them or tell me another way.Thank you so much!

Hi Doug,

is there a way to update properties in a CheckinFileEvents.Post EventHandler (running in Inventor)?

If it's not a bug in my code, it seems to me that the "native" vault plugin locks the Inventor file.

So I removed the iProperty mappings and tried checking the file out in the EventHandler to update the properties directly via Vault API. The checkout fails with 1004...

Is there a general "lock" during those operations?
Would be great, if you could help me with this one :)

Best regards
Martin

I don't know how the native Vault plugin works.  However you should be able to figure out what the error is.  Error 1004 is coming from the server, and the server treats the Inventor client like any other. There is no special "lock".

Check that the file isn't checked out already.  It's possible that the 'keepCheckedOut' setting was set to true.
Also check that the parameters to your checkout call are valid.

Hi Doug,
is there a way to know *which* files are Checkin-ing from Inventor without call the Web Service? My problem is: i need to know, from an undefined assembly wich parts (or sub-assembly) the designer are saving to Vault, to read their iProperties and saving them on my mirror DB. It's enough to get the filelist of the ChecklistFiledialog that appears before Inventor Checkin files in Vault

Thx in advance,

No, you need to make a web service call.  The check in event gives you just the ID.  You need to make the web service call to get the File object.

The operation has not happened yet.  So you can get the From state by looking up up the File object.  The File MasterID is passed in with the event args.
The ID of the To state is a field on the event args.

Sorry we do not have VBA support.  The recommended approach is to write a .NET plug-in to Inventor.  From there, you can interface directly with the Vault DLLs, which are also .NET.

Yes, you can get that information.  When the event is called, cast the "sender" Object to type IWebService.  The Url property has the server name and the SecurityHeader has the UserId.

The vault name is harder to get, but I have an article with a suggested workaround:

<p>Keeping with the theme of visualizing things that are not visual by default, I present to you <strong>Show Revision Diagram</strong>.&#0160; <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/showching-tong.html">Showching Tong</a> and <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/alan-zang.html">Alan Zang</a> created this app to help illustrate the revision concept.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2011/ShowRevisionDiagram/screen1.png" /></p>
<p><strong>Requirements:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Vault Workgroup 2012, Vault Collaboration 2012 or Vault Professional 2012</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/Apps/ShowRevisionDiagram/ShowRevisionDiagram-1.0.1.0-bin.zip">Click here to download the application</a> <br /><a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/Apps/ShowRevisionDiagram/ShowRevisionDiagram-1.0.1.0-src.zip">Click here to download the source code</a></p>
<p><strong><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2011/4apps/4 apps-hr2.png" /> <br />To Use:      <br /></strong>Just download the app and run the install.&#0160; Right click-on a file and run the Show Revision Diagram command.&#0160; A dialog will pop-up showing the revision history for that file.</p>
<p>The large character represents the revision iteration. The small number to the right is the version number that represents the revision.&#0160; If the text is underlined, then the revision is currently not a released state.</p>
<p>A revision that has been re-released (most likely through a quick change processes) will display a large box with smaller boxes inside. The larger box represents the main revision. The smaller boxes show the multiple version that represent each released version of the revision.</p>
<p>An O with a bar over it represents a null revision or the absence of a revision. This is treated in the same manner as an actual revision.</p>
<p>The color of the boxes has no meaning.</p>
<p>Hover your mouse over a box to see its lifecycle state.     <br /><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2011/ShowRevisionDiagram/screen2.png" /></p>

When I came into college, I got attracted by computer games with couple of my classmates. We spent a lot of time playing different kinds of games together. Interested in winning, I wondered how the games worked, and what can I do to hack. The proudest result I achieved is when I’d hacked a web based game to get unlimited money and skillset. Thus I became the most powerful man in that virtual world. :)</p>
<p>I got a job as programmer after graduation, developing a management system for forklift production. Not as exciting as hacking games, but still very enjoyable. 6 years ago, I joined the Autodesk Vault development team. During these years, I have seen its API becoming more and more easy to use. Even though my work now is more management focused, I still get excited to code something in my spare time.</p>

No, this sample needs to be updated if it is to work with Vault 2013.  I don't decide what things go in the app store, but I'll pass along your suggestion.

Currently there are no plans to update this app for Vault 2013.  
Either use the Vault 2012 client or get a programmer to update the app using the source code.

Sorry, it only works with Vault 2012.  To use with 2015 R2, somebody with programming experience would need to download the source and update it.

<p>Now that Vault 11111011100 has been released, I can now talk about the cool new SDK features.&#0160; There are a bunch of things that I can talk about, but for now, I&#39;ll just list the top 1000 features.</p>
<p><strong>Feature 0000:&#0160; Events      <br /></strong>You can now get Pre and Post events whenever a Vault application performs certain actions, such as checking in a file.&#0160; There is also a GetRestrictions event which allows you to block the operation.</p>
<p><strong><strong>Feature </strong>0001:&#0160; Access to Client-side functionality      <br /></strong>Call directly into Vault Explorer to run tasks like update properties or get the working folder.</p>
<p><strong><strong>Feature </strong>0010:&#0160; More VB       <br /></strong>Inline code samples are now in VB.Net as well as C#.&#0160; The job server sample app is now also in VB.Net.</p>
<p><strong><strong>Feature </strong>0011:&#0160; Lifecycle event jobs for Items and Change Orders       <br /></strong>The Lifecycle Event Editor has been expanded beyond just files.&#0160; <br /> <img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2011/Top1000/LifecycleEventEditor_scaled.png" /></p>
<p><strong><strong>Feature </strong>0100:&#0160; FileVersion selection type      <br /></strong>You can now run custom commands from files selected in the History, Uses and Where Used tabs.</p>
<p><strong><strong>Feature </strong>0101:&#0160; WebServiceManager       <br /></strong>A factory/manager for web service objects has been built right in to the API.</p>
<p><strong>Feature 0110:&#0160; Automatic re-sign in      <br /></strong>If you use the provided WebServiceManager, by default the web services will automatically re-authenticate if you Vault credentials go stale.</p>
<p><strong><strong>Feature </strong>0111:&#0160; Intellesense comments       <br /></strong>See the API documentation right as you code in Visual Studio.     <br /><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2011/Top1000/intellesense.png" /></p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>I&#39;ll be going into each of these features and more in the upcoming months.&#0160; This post was just to give you a taste of things to come (and test your knowledge of binary numbers).</p>

<p>To celebrate the release of the Vault 2012, I will be releasing 1 sample app per week for the next 4 weeks.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s start things off with the <strong>Google Map Extension for Autodesk Vault</strong>.&#0160; This one is authored by <strong>Gavin Guo</strong>, one of the developers on Vault.</p>
<p><a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2011/GoogleMap/tabView.png" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2011/GoogleMap/tabView_scaled.png" style="border: 0px;" /></a> <br /><span style="color: #000000; font-size: xx-small;">(click image for full view)</span></p>

I was hoping to enhance the capability of Google Maps, since it's part of my work to study maps and locations, and this post is what I need. With this, I can easily mark the locations on the map that I need, just like using pushpins on a wall map. Great work! Thanks a lot!

It should work fine with both the 32 and 64 bit clients.  I'm not aware of any issues.

Great Work Doug,

Will this extension work with future version of Vault e.g 2014 and the upcoming 2015 release?

No.  Vault plug-ins are tied to a specific version.  So the code needs to be updated to work with Vault 2014 or 2015.

<p>Any many of you have pointed out, there isn&#39;t much sample code out there on working with Change Orders.&#0160; So let me attempt to remedy that by providing code on two common operations you might want to do through the API:&#0160; creating a new Change Order and updating the lifecycle state of a Change Order.</p>
<p><strong>Adding a new Change Order     <br /></strong>A new Change Order will always use the default workflow.&#0160; A workflow is the set of lifecycle states and transitions (activities) between them.&#0160; Once created, the Change Order is locked to that workflow forever.&#0160;</p>
<p>So, when you create a new Change Order you don&#39;t need to pass in the workflow.&#0160; But you do need to pass in the routing, which is the set of users and their roles on that Change Order.&#0160; You also need to pass in the number for the Change Order.&#0160; The easiest route is to just use the default routing and default numbering scheme, as shown below.</p>

<p><strong>Moving to a new state     <br /></strong>One nice thing is that the Change Order object has an Activities property which lists all the valid state changes currently possible.&#0160; So, all your code needs to do is pick one and run the update calls.&#0160; There are a few things you need to know:</p>
<ul>
<li>There might not be any activities.&#0160; There are a couple of &quot;sink&quot; states where Change Orders cannot move out of.</li>
<li>An activity might loop back to the same state.&#0160; For example, you can perform the review operation when you are in the review state.&#0160; This will result in the Change Order moving to the review state.&#0160; So even though an activity was performed, the state is the same.</li>
<li>Closing a Change Order requires additional information, effectivity.&#0160; Therefore, a different API function is used for that case.</li>
</ul>
<p>Like with many Item operations, you need to do 2 calls to perform the update.&#0160; The first call starts the operation and the second call commits the operation.&#0160; If something goes wrong, you need to call an undo function.</p>

Hi,

I am looking for some help regarding the Vault 2014 API to have an event triggered when an ECO item is at review state and the user clicks the approve option from the actions menu. What I am looking for is a Vault API call to catch this event and do some function there after.
What event handler should I use from the 2014 API?

Many thanks.

<p>If you have a custom command and an exception is thrown within your code, good programming practice is to handle that exception and not let it bubble up to the hosting application.&#0160; The reason is that the hosting application may not know how to handle the exception properly.&#0160; Some API&#39;s may have built in support for passing specific types of exceptions up the stack, but Vault Explorer does not have one of those APIs.</p>
<p>Let me explain what happens when you throw an exception from a custom command within Vault Explorer.&#0160; If the exception is directly on Vault Explorer&#39;s call stack, it will get &quot;eaten&quot; by Vault Explorer.&#0160; In other words, Vault Explorer will catch the exception then do nothing with it. This is the intended behavior for Vault Explorer.&#0160; However I have recently become aware of a few cases that result in un-intended behavior.</p>
<p>One interesting back door is when the exception comes from an event in custom UI.&#0160; For example, your command launches a custom dialog, and your OnClick event code has an exception that you don&#39;t handle.&#0160; In this case, the Vault Explorer treats it like an exception from any of the built-in dialogs and attempts to handle the issue.&#0160; Usually the handling involves parsing the error and displaying a formatted error dialog.&#0160;</p>
<p>In the case of server errors (SOAPExceptions), this is great because Vault Explorer will parse the error for you and display it in the proper language.&#0160; <br /><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2011/Exceptions/SOAPError.png" /> <br />I&#39;ll admit, this is pretty nice back door.&#0160; The only downside that I can see is that the error text was written with Vault Explorer in mind and may not make sense in the context of your application.</p>
<p>But if the exception is not a SOAP Exception you will likely get a CER dialog.&#0160; If you don&#39;t know what a CER dialog is, let me show you a picture.   <br />&#0160;<img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2011/Exceptions/CER.png" /> <br />Recognize it now?&#0160; You want to avoid this dialog.</p>
<p>An even worse case comes up if your command spawns a thread which bubbles up an exception.&#0160; In that case, the CER pops up and the application crashes.   <br /><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2011/Exceptions/AppCrash.png" />&#0160; <br />You <strong>really</strong> want to avoid this dialog.</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>The best way to avoid these bad cases is to handle your exceptions.&#0160; When in doubt, you can always wrap everything in a try/catch block.&#0160; See examples below.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2011/02/coding-for-performance-array-functions.html" target="_blank">my last Coding for Performance article</a>, I explained the best way to get File objects from a set of File ID values.&#0160; But what if you don&#39;t have the ID&#39;s?&#0160; What if you want to get all the files in the Vault, and you don&#39;t have any information to start with?&#0160; I came up with 3 techniques you can use to get this information.&#0160; Let&#39;s see wich one performs the best.</p>
<p><strong>Technique 1:</strong> Start at the root folder and recursively scan through each folder one level at a time, gathering up the files along the way.&#0160; The cost is going to be 2 API calls per folder in the Vault.&#0160; For each folder, we will be calling GetLatestFilesByFolderId and GetFoldersByParentId with the recurse parameter set to false.</p>
<p><strong>Technique 2:</strong>&#0160; Gather up all the folders and get all the files in all the folders with 1 API call.&#0160; You can get all the folders by calling GetFolderRoot then calling GetFoldersByParentId with the recurse parameter set to true.&#0160; Next, call GetLatestFilesByFolderIds and pass in all folder IDs.&#0160; The result will be all files.&#0160; So we get it all in 3 API calls.</p>
<p><strong>Technique 3</strong>: Do a file search with no search conditions, which will result in finding all files.&#0160; FindFilesBySearchConditions is the functions that I will be using.&#0160; I will be passing in null for the folderIds parameter, which will result in a search across all folders.&#0160; The number of API calls depends on the paging setup.&#0160; Divide the total number of files by the paging size and that&#39;s how many API calls are made.</p>
<p>NOTE: I&#39;m going to assume that there are no file shares for this test.&#0160; In other words, each file lives in one and only one folder.&#0160;</p>
<p>NOTE: Technically there are 2 variables here, the number of folders and the number of files.&#0160; To simplify things, I&#39;ll assume a constant ratio between files and folders.&#0160; This is usually the case in the real world.&#0160; The more files you have, the more folders you will probably have.&#0160; I will be using a ratio of about 10 files for every 1 folder.</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>Here is the resulting graph<br /><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2011/Performance-GetAllFiles/Graph.png" /></p>
<p>So what happened here?&#0160; It looked like Technique 2 was slightly better than Technique 3, but it curved up at the end.&#0160; The reason is that Technique 3 tries to get to much information in a single call.&#0160; First, it gets every folder in the Vault with a single call to GetFoldersByParentId.&#0160; Next, it gets every file in the Vault with a single call to GetLatestFilesByFolderIds.</p>
<p>As I mentioned in <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2011/02/coding-for-performance-array-functions.html" target="_blank">my last performance article</a>, you need an upper bound on these calls.&#0160; You can&#39;t just get millions of objects in a single call.&#0160; Both Technique 1 and Technique 3 have boundaries built-in, which keeps things nice an linear.&#0160; Technique 3 wins out because it makes less API calls than Technique 1.&#0160; Another nice thing is that Technique 3 is folder independent.&#0160; It will have the same performance regardless of the number of folders or the folder structure.</p>

Doug,

I have a application that needs to query my vault. If I know the local ( absolute ) folder and want to return a list of all the vault files in it to know what file names are in it.

Is there a quick way of scoping the search condition to all files in a folder?

Thx - NLD

If you know the Vault path, you can call FindFilesBySearchConditions and pass in the Folder Id.  The search will only be applied to objects in that folder and any sub-folders.

Going from a local folder on disk to a Vault folder is a bit tricky.  I think most people start at the root Vault folder, get the working folder (Connection.WorkingFoldersManager.GetWorkingFolder()) and use that to map between local path and Vault path.  This only works if the sub-folders don't define their own working folder in another location.

<p><strong>Update:</strong> For Vault 2013, we moved over to .NET 4.&#0160; See <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2012/05/net-4.html" target="_self">this post</a> for more details.&#0160; The rest of this article refers to Vault 2012.</p>
<p>We don&#39;t support .NET 4.0 extensions for Vault Explorer or Job Processor.&#0160; The problem is that Vault Explorer and Job Processor are 3.5 applications.&#0160; And a 3.5 application cannot load a 4.0 DLL.&#0160; In these cases, you will usually see an error message like, <em>&quot;Could not load file or assembly &#39;Foo&#39; or one of its dependencies. The system cannot find the file specified.&quot;</em></p>
<p>To fix, you need to switch your compile settings to .NET 3.5 or earlier.&#0160;</p>
<p>To change the settings is a VS 2010 C# project, go to the Application tab in your project settings and change the Target Framework.   <br /><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2011/DotNet4/CSharp-scaled.png" /></p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>To change the settings is a VS 2010 VB.NET project, go to the Compile tab in your project settings and click the Advanced Compile Options button.&#0160; In the dialog that pops-up, change the Target framework.     <br /><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2011/DotNet4/VB1.png" /></p>

Hello,
   When i want use this extension, i have this error when i click on the main form to modify the access right:
"Object reference not set to an instance of an object".
I have Vault Pro 2012 SP1. I have test the extension folder with your TestLoader.exe and the result is good. I don't have the menu in Tools. I have already try to delete the folder and rebuilt the solution with the same error.
I want manage the folders access for groups and users.
Thanks for your help.
Olivier

I think you posted to the wrong article.  Which extension are you trying to get working?

<p>Update:&#0160; The <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2011/07/q-2ools.html" target="_self">Vault 2012 version of this app</a> is now available.</p>
<p>Q-Tools for Autodesk Vault is my attempt to fix job server issues that I have heard about or experienced myself.&#0160; The utility is a Windows service that contains various features that you can turn on or off depending on how you want to use the job queue.&#0160; It&#39;s best if I just talk about the features themselves.</p>
<p><strong>Feature - Logging      <br /></strong>Q-Tools logs everything it determines is an &quot;issue&quot;.&#0160; You have some flexibility on defining what an issue is.&#0160; More on that later.     <br />If you are in a multi-site environment, Q-Tools will provide a single log for all queues. Logging is the only feature that you can&#39;t turn off.</p>
<p><strong>Feature - Stale Job Detection    <br /></strong>If a job has been on the queue for a long time, you can set Q-Tools to consider this an issue.&#0160; A lot of times these &quot;stale jobs&quot; mean that there is an issue with the job processor or a client queued jobs that have no handlers.</p>
<p><strong>Feature - Email Reports      <br /></strong>You can configure Q-Tools to send out an email, listing all the issues it detected.&#0160; <br /><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2011/QTools/email.png" /></p>
<p><strong>Feature - Queue Cleanup      <br /></strong>If there is an job on the queue in the error state, Q-Tools can automatically log and delete it for you.&#0160; You can configure it so that only certain job types get cleaned up this way.</p>
<p><strong>Feature - Queue Forwarding      <br /></strong>In a multi-site environment each site gets its own queue.&#0160; If you would rather have one queue for all sites, Q-Tools can make this happen by letting you designate a &quot;central queue&quot;.&#0160; All jobs from other queues are forwarded to the central queue.&#0160;</p>

I badly need to use your q-tools, i need to redirect all jobs in an replicated environment to the main site, i get an error thou when trying to do so, any suggestion on what might cause this error? (i see the error code and it suggests duplicate jobs in que but i can't figure out why this happens, all my jobs has an uniqe guid etc). q-tools is installed on the main site.

My error from the log:

That might be the problem.  I designed this tool for a multi-workgroup environment, but never tested on a singe-workgroup, multi-site environment.  
Since the Add happens before the Delete, that could explain the problem.

You will need to fix the code to get it to work.  I can think of a couple of ways to fix this:
- Do the Delete first before the Add (see the Reroute function in QToolsService.cs).  However you run the risk of losing the job during a failure.
- Add a dummy parameter to the job.  This will be enough to prevent error 237.  However you are assuming that the job handlers don't mind extra dummy parameters.

Thanks Doug, i have edited the code and is now up and running. 

Another question about this set of tools if is there is any setting i can make to prevent q-tools resubmitting error jobs to the que? Can't find any setting for this. Is it possible?

I did some modification in the source code and removed the resubmit of error jobs. 

Maybe this should be a setting if you migrate this tools in the future.

I just want to be clear on what the problem is.  You have an error job and it gets routed to the central queue?  You would prefer it just get deleted from the original queue?

No, all my jobs gets routed to the central que. After that some jobs may raise errors, then q-tools keeps on resubmitting thoose jobs over and over again (even thou they are alredy in the central que). 

This is not what i wanted in this case, i want the user to read the error in the job-que dialog and take action manually. But, as i said i fixed it in your code so that it fits my needs. For the future maybe this behavior should not be default.

I think I see what is going on.  Q-Tools can't distinguish between jobs on the local site and jobs on a remote site.  Therefore it tries to re-route jobs that have already been rerouted.

The best fix I can think of is to add a new parameter when re-routing a job.  Next update the code so that Q-Tools doesn't re-route a job that has the property on it.  The result is a guarantee that a job won't get rerouted more than once.

I'm not planning on updating it for 2014.  Since it's not a plug-in, the 2013 version should still work in 2014.  But I haven't tested.

<p>If you have worked with Vault for a while, you may have noticed that certain data is specific to a vault and some data applies to all vaults.&#0160; I&#39;ll refer to the second type as System Data.&#0160;</p>
<p>As much as I hate to go into the database details, it&#39;s the only way to fully understand this topic.&#0160; Each vault gets its own database, but there is also another database, called KnowledgeVaultMaster (KVM), which manages all the vaults.&#0160; This database design is what distinguishes between system data and vault data.&#0160; <strong>If</strong> <strong>it&#39;s in the KVM, it&#39;s system data</strong>.&#0160; <strong>If it&#39;s in a Vault database, it&#39;s vault data</strong>.&#0160; That&#39;s the critical difference, and it shows itself in many aspects of the Vault framework.</p>
<p>One of the more obvious places is the Administration sub-menu in Vault Explorer.&#0160; There are two options, one for vault-specific data and one for system data (aka. global data).    <br /><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2011/VaultDataSystemData/menu.png" /></p>
<p>Another example is the SignIn and SignIn2 functions in the SecurityService.&#0160; The first one is for logging in to a specific vault database and the second one is for logging in to the KVM.&#0160;</p>
<p>If you are in a replicated environment and you want to get admin ownership, you need to call GetDatabaseOwnership and specify if you want to own a vault database or the KVM.</p>
<p>Here is a basic breakdown of which data is in which database.</p>
<p><strong>Vault-specific data:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Files </li>
<li>Folders </li>
<li>Items </li>
<li>Change Orders </li>
<li>Properties </li>
<li>Categories </li>
<li>Lifecycles </li>
<li>ACLs </li>
<li>Jobs </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>System data:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Users </li>
<li>Groups </li>
<li>Roles </li>
<li>Job Queue </li>
</ul>
<p><br />The job queue is a weird one.&#0160; The queue itself is maintained by the KVN, but each job is associated to a specific vault.&#0160; So you need to be logged in to a vault to add the job, but you can be logged in to the KVM for reading the queue.&#0160; If you are viewing the job queue in Vault Explorer, you are seeing jobs from all vaults.   <br /><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2011/VaultDataSystemData/JobQueue.png" /> <br />You can customize the columns if you want to show the associated vault.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/TipsAndTricks2.png" /></p>
<p>Welcome to a new ongoing series which will be focusing on writing optimized Vault code.&#0160; In may cases, there are multiple ways to get data from the Vault server, but some ways may be quicker than others depending on your needs.</p>
<p>There are many factors in Vault performance.&#0160; Network speed, server configuration, available memory, concurrent users, and so on.&#0160; These articles will not be focusing on any of that.&#0160; I will be covering only the <strong>coding</strong> aspect of performance.</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>This article I will be focusing on what I like to call the <em>Golden Rule of Vault API performance</em>.</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" width="450">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="450">Golden Rule: <strong>Minimize the number of Web Service calls.</strong></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>You should always follow the Golden Rule... except in cases where you don&#39;t.&#0160; I&#39;ll be sure to point these cases out when they come up.&#0160;</p>
<p>Looking through the API, you probably noticed some functions come in pairs, one that deals with a single object and one that deals with arrays of objects.&#0160; For this example, I will focus on <strong>GetFileById</strong> and <strong>GetFilesByIds</strong> in the Document Service.</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" width="450">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="450">
<p>File <strong>GetFileById (</strong> <br />&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; Long <em>fileId</em> <br /><strong>);</strong></p>
<p>File [] <strong>GetFilesByIds (</strong> <br />&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; Long [] <em>fileIds</em> <br /><strong>);</strong></p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The 2 functions do the same thing, they take a file ID and return the File object.&#0160; But one function is capable of getting multiple objects and the other one can only get a single object.&#0160;</p>
<p>According to the Golden Rule, you should always use GetFilesByIds since it minimizes the number of API calls.&#0160; Technically, GetFileById can be removed from the API entirely.&#0160; It&#39;s a bit easier to use if you want to get a single object, but that&#39;s the only advantage.&#0160; Most of these non-array functions are hold-overs from early versions of the API.&#0160; When new API functions are added, there is usually only the the array version.</p>
<p>I ran some tests using a vault that I loaded with 100,000 files.&#0160; I then proceeded to get arrays of File objects using the two mechanisms.&#0160; For example, I would get 100 File objects with 1 GetFilesbyIds call and compare the time with getting the same data with 100 GetFileById calls.</p>
<p><br />Here is the resulting graph.<img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2011/Performance-ArrayFunctions/Graph.png" /></p>
<p>The results are what you would expect.&#0160; Both methods increase in a linear fashion based on the number of Files being returned.&#0160; However the Single Method is a much steeper line.&#0160; In my case, it was about 17x steeper and that was with client and server on the same machine.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p><strong>The upper boundary      <br /></strong>The array functions are good for moderate to large data sets.&#0160; But what about very large data sets?&#0160; For example, you want 1 million File objects.&#0160; Problems start to arise when you try to do it all in a single call.&#0160;</p>
<p>One common problem is the HTTP transfer limit, which is 50 MB.&#0160; So if your data is larger than 50 MB when it gets transferred, you can&#39;t do it in one call.&#0160; If you go over the limit, you will get an exception from the HTTP or WSE framework.</p>
<p>Another problem is server performance.&#0160; Don&#39;t forget that you application is probably not the only Vault client.&#0160; There may be others using Vault at the same time and you don&#39;t want to use up all the server cycles.&#0160; Sometimes it&#39;s better to deliberately slow down your program to make the system more usable for everyone.</p>
<p>Lastly, there are timeouts in place, both at the web server and at the database level.&#0160; I believe that our installer recommends 900 seconds (15 minutes) for the web server timeout.&#0160; The database timeouts are more complex, but most queries have a 6 minute timeout.</p>
<p>For the GetFilesByIds case, I suggest, 10,000 as your upper bound.&#0160; This number may vary depending on how good or bad your system is.&#0160; But overall. you should be safe using this number.</p>
<p><strong>Future Articles     <br /></strong>This example was pretty basic since it was the first in the series.&#0160; In future articles, you can look forward to more complex workflows with multiple solutions.&#0160; I&#39;ll try my best to draw from real-world situations, so feel free to leave a comment with something you have had issues with.</p>

Hi Doug!

How do you explain the nonlinear growth of the red curve? I would have expected two *linear* curves, where one curve is steeper than the other.

kind regards

The red line curves up slightly at the end due to my laptop running out of resources.  This is the computer I use for development, so I had a debug version of Vault running.  Then I started a VMWare image with Vault 2011 client and server running.  My test app then connected to the server in the VMWare and ran the tests.

Needless to say, this wasn't an ideal test.  By the end, all my memory was gone and my hard drive was getting a good workout.  

In a better environment, you would see a more linear red line.

Doug, could you please explain following:
- Calling FindLatestFilesByPaths() and passing a string array with 250 items takes about 300 seconds (one Web Service call)
- Calling FindLatestFilesByPaths() for each every item takes about 240 seconds (250 Web Service call)

To measure the time I took a Stopwatch object and I tried this multiple times to play it safe.. relating to your upper article progress with only one Web Service call should be much faster - any explanations?

Was your server localhost?  If so, it's not an accurate real-world test.  

If you are using a different server, then my only guess is that the cost of the bulk data transfer outweighs the cost of opening the multiple HTTP connections.
It's rare for these cases to happen, but it's possible.  For read operations, the HTTP cost is usually the most expensive part of an API call.

<p>Multi-site links require that an administrator first set up the list of Vault sites.&#0160; <br /> <img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2011/LinkMaestro/multisite-settings_scaled.png" /></p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p><strong>Using Web Browser links:      <br /></strong>I do not recommend storing links to web client pages.&#0160; These links are not designed for long term use.&#0160; First, they link to a specific version.&#0160; So as time goes on, the link will go out of date.&#0160; Or the version could get purged, which will break the link.&#0160; Next, the link syntax may change in future releases.    <br /> <br />Web browser links work best for short term use, such as sending an email to a colleague with a download link.    <br /><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2011/LinkMaestro/LinkExample_scaled.png" /></p>

What does Copy Link do?  I searched for it but couldn't find it.  I need to know what Copy Link does so I know what Link Maestro does.

The out-of-the-box "Copy Link" command can be found under the Edit menu.  In Vault 2012 this command was renamed to "Copy Hyperlink".
If you don't have a file selected, you may not see the command.

The default behavior is to create a URL for the currently selected item and save that text to the clipboard.  You can then paste the URL into an email or document. 

Link Maestro enhances this command by allowing more options for the URL format.

Doug,

   Is it possible to make the copy hyperlink command appear in the context menu. instead of having to go up to the edit menu?

You can only do that by editing the source code and re-building.  In code, you can add a new CommandSite with FileContextMenu as the location.  Add the copy link command to the site and you should be good.

Hi Doug,
Is it possible to elaborate on how to Hide Commands, I'm new to the vault API, and I need to write something which will hide the "Submit and force Approval buttons". 
I've got my dll.s set up, and I've figured out where the Hidden Commands function is, I'm just having issues figuring out how to use it.
Do you have any VB examples of how something like this may be accomplished, or are you able to elaborate on what needs doing?

<p>UPDATE:&#0160; This post applies only to the Vault 2011 release.&#0160; <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2011/05/extension-deployment-checklist.html" target="_self">The Vault 2012 checklist can be found here</a>.</p>
<p>For my first post of the year, I would like to go over the various things that can keep your custom Vault Explorer command from deploying properly.&#0160; In many of the cases, you don&#39;t get an error or anything.&#0160; Instead, the command just doesn&#39;t show up, leaving you to wonder what went wrong.</p>
<p>With that in mind, I created a checklist for you to use when you can&#39;t figure out why your command is not showing up:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Are you using Vault Workgroup, Collaboration or Professional? </strong><br />(<em>custom commands are not available in base Vault</em>) </li>
<li><strong>Did you reset your menus in Vault Explorer? </strong><br />(<em>either delete Menus.xml or right-click on the menu bar and select Customize</em>) </li>
<li><strong>Did you deploy to [VaultClientInstallDir]\Explorer\Extensions\[myExtension]? </strong></li>
<li><strong>Did you include a .vcet.config file? </strong></li>
<li><strong>Does the .vcet.config file have the correct Assembly name? </strong><br />(<em>it should be your DLL name without the &quot;.dll&quot; at the end</em>) </li>
<li><strong>Does the .vcet.config file have the correct Folder name? </strong></li>
<li><strong>Does your assembly have an ApiVersion attribute? </strong></li>
<li><strong>Is your project using .NET 3.5 or earlier?</strong><br />(<em>.NET 4.0 is not supported for command extensions</em>. <em><a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2011/02/net-40.html" target="_self">Click here for instructions</a>.</em>)</li>
<li><strong>Does your IExtension implementation have a default constructor? </strong><br />(<em>a default constructor is a constructor with no arguments, if no constructor is in the code, the compiler will create one</em>) </li>
<li><strong>Do your CommandSite objects have non-empty Label values? </strong><br />(<em>the label can&#39;t be null or empty, even if you are not displaying a sub menu</em>) </li>
</ul>

The link above is for a problem I'm seeing where a spreadsheet is driving an assembly & just checking in & out updates the vault version eventhough no design changes have been made - tick these boxes changes this behaviour & I can't find an explanation of what they do.

Thanks

Correct, these comments are not the preferred mechanism for tech support.  Also, your issue doesn't seem to have anything to do with custom Vault programming, so it's not a good fit for this blog.

Lastly, I don't know much about how the check-out dialog works, so I honestly don't know the answer to your issue.

Sorry that I couldn't have been more help.  You might want to try posting to the newsgroup again.  Sometimes a second post works.

<p><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/TipsAndTricks2.png" /></p>
<p>The <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2010/12/advanced-advanced-find.html">Advanced Advanced Find</a> application shows how to make use of the &quot;search rule&quot; concept.&#0160; This is one of the very few features that&#39;s available only in the API.&#0160; For some reason, the out-of-the-box search dialog does not expose this feature.</p>
<p>Now that I have a sample out on this feature, I&#39;d like to explain a bit more on how to use it.&#0160; In the API there are 3 rule types:&#0160; May, Must and MustNot.&#0160; MustNot doesn&#39;t work, so I&#39;ll only focus on May and Must.&#0160; In programming terms, I like to think of May and Must statements as OR and AND conditions respectively.&#0160;</p>
<p>The Must (AND) behavior is what is exposed in the UI find dialog, and it&#39;s the behavior from versions earlier than 2011.&#0160; The May (OR) behavior is new for Vault 2011.&#0160; At least it is new at the Search Condition level.&#0160;</p>
<p>It is possible to use the word &quot;or&quot; in the value of the search condition (see picture below).&#0160; It does result in OR behavior, but that trick can only be used on a single property.&#0160; The May rule is the only way to OR together different properties.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; <img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2010/FindDialog.png" /></p>
<p><strong>&#0160;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Usage:      <br /></strong>In order for the search to work properly, the following requirements must be met:</p>
<ul>
<li>The search contains at least 1 Must condition </li>
<li>May conditions must have at least one other May condition.&#0160; In other words, you can have 0 May conditions or more than 1 May conditions.&#0160; If there is only 1 May condition, it is ignored. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&#0160;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Order of operations:      <br /></strong>The order that the conditions are in does not matter.&#0160; The reason is that all the May conditions are grouped together and OR&#39;ed against each other.&#0160; The result is then AND&#39;ed to the Must statements.</p>
<p>For example, the collection of conditions <span style="color: #ff0000;">{ May X, Must Y, May Z}</span>&#0160; can be rewritten as <span style="color: #ff0000;">(X or Z) and Y</span>.&#0160; Since everything is grouped together in this manner, the search conditions can be in any order.</p>

<p>Sometimes the Advanced Find feature in Vault is not enough.&#0160; You need something more advanced, specifically something that supports OR style searches.&#0160; With that in mind, I created the <em>Advanced</em> Advanced Find dialog.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2010/AdvancedAdvancedFind.png" /></p>
<p><strong>Overview:     <br /></strong>The dialog works similar to the Advanced tab in the regular Find dialog.&#0160; However there is one new thing, the Rule parameter.&#0160; This can be either Must or May.&#0160; Must is the default behavior and means that the search condition must be met in order for the object to show up in the search results.&#0160; The May option means that an object will show up&#0160; if it satisfies at least 1 of the conditions.&#0160;</p>

<p><strong>Author&#39;s Note:     <br /></strong>Yes, I know that the standard Find dialog does many things that my dialog doesn&#39;t (saved searches, reports, that animated hourglass icon, etc), but &quot;Find Dialog That Is Advanced In One Specific Way&quot; was too long of a title.</p>

JustOnesAndZeros.Webservices.dll is not used for my Vault 2012 apps.  I didn't need that DLL as much since the WebServiceManager was added to the Vault 2012 API.

<p><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/TipsAndTricks3.png" /></p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Additonal features have been added for <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2011/06/file-versions-and-links-in-the-selection-set.html" target="_self">Vault 2012</a>.&#0160; This article focuses on the Vault 2011 features.</p>
<p>You have a command or tab view in Vault Explorer.&#0160; And you have your command and tab view handlers in place for when the user interacts with your control.&#0160; These handlers get a Context object passed in so that your code can know things about the state of the application.&#0160; More specifically, your code can determine which things have been selected.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s take a deeper look at these selection sets.</p>
<p>Each set is a collection of <strong>ISelection</strong> objects.&#0160; Each object consists of three pieces of data.&#0160; The <strong>Label</strong> is the display value of the things selected.&#0160; The <strong>TypeId</strong> tells you what type of object is selected.&#0160; The <strong>ID</strong> tells you the Vault ID of the thing selected.&#0160; So the things you can do with a selection is dependant on what type it is.</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" width="450">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="225"><strong>TypeId</strong></td>
<td valign="top" width="225"><strong>Id meaning</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="225">File</td>
<td valign="top" width="225">File.MasterId</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="225">Folder</td>
<td valign="top" width="225">Folder.Id</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="225">Item</td>
<td valign="top" width="225">Item.Id</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="225">Bom</td>
<td valign="top" width="225">Item.Id</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="225">Change Order</td>
<td valign="top" width="225">ChangeOrder.Id</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="225">Other</td>
<td valign="top" width="225">&quot;-1&quot;&#0160; <br />Whatever is selected is not supported.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="225">None</td>
<td valign="top" width="225">Not used</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Make sure to always check the type before you attempt to use the ID value.&#0160; The HelloWorld sample in the SDK has a great example of not following this rule.</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>The <strong>Current Selection Set</strong> represents the currently selected thing, assuming the thing supports the selection set framework.&#0160; It&#39;s possible to have nothing selected, so this set may be empty.&#0160; But if you are running from a context menu, this should always always have at least 1 value.</p>
<p>Here is a list of things that can have selection sets :</p>
<ul>
<li>The navigation tree </li>
<li>The main View grid </li>
<li>The history tab (items only) </li>
<li>The where used tab (items only) </li>
<li>The change order tab </li>
<li>The records tab (items only) </li>
<li>The Find dialog </li>
</ul>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>The <strong>Nav Selection Set</strong> represents the tree view on the left.&#0160; If a Folder is selected, this will contain a selection type Folder with an ID value.&#0160; For non-folder items, such as saved searches or the Item Master, you will get Other as the type with -1 as the ID.&#0160; There should always be 1 value in this set.&#0160;</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>The <strong>View Selection Set</strong> represents the selections in the main grid.&#0160; It works pretty much how you would expect.&#0160; In cases where there is a pop-up menu, like the find dialog, the View selection set is still from the main grid on the parent dialog.</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>The <strong>Preview Selection Set</strong> seems to be mostly useless for files.&#0160; Even if you do have a file selected, it shows up as an Other type with -1 as the ID.&#0160; <br />However, with Items, you can select BOM Items and get BOM selection data.&#0160; The History and Where Used tabs both give Item selections as you would expect.&#0160; For the other tabs (General, View and custom) the selection set will match the view selection set.     <br />Change Orders mostly don&#39;t use this set.&#0160; With the Records tab, you can get all the Item objects properly, but Files show up as Other with -1 Ids.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/TipsAndTricks2.png" /></p>
<p>I want to explain some of the more confusing aspects of File attachments and dependencies.&#0160;</p>
<p><strong>What is a Dependency?      <br /></strong>It&#39;s just what it sounds like.&#0160; The parent file <em>depends</em> on the child file.&#0160; The parent file can&#39;t work properly if the child file is not present.&#0160; Dependencies should be only created programmatically such as the CAD client or a custom program.</p>
<p><strong>What is an Attachment?      <br /></strong>It a parent/child link where the parent does not depend on the child file.&#0160; This is the only association type that the end user can explicitly create in the Vault Explorer client.&#0160;</p>
<p><strong>What type should I use?      <br /></strong>Sometimes it&#39;s unclear what type to use.&#0160; I recommend asking yourself this question &quot;When viewing the parent file, do I always want the child file to be present?&quot;&#0160; If the answer is yes, then it&#39;s a dependency.&#0160; If the answer is no, then it&#39;s probably an attachment.</p>
<p><strong>How do dependencies affect behavior?      <br /></strong>A lot more business logic is built into dependencies.&#0160; Operations that will break a file reference are restricted.&#0160; For example, you can&#39;t delete a file that has a parent dependency.&#0160; However, you are allowed to do the delete if you are deleting all the parents too.&#0160;</p>
<p>The move and rename operations in Vault Explorer have special client-side logic for updating parent references during these operations.&#0160; If the parent can&#39;t be updated, the operation is blocked.&#0160; However this is all client-side logic.&#0160; The server will allow moves and renames in these cases.&#0160; So it&#39;s up to the client application to insure that file references don&#39;t get broken when the API calls are made.</p>
<p><strong>What is a Design Visualization attachment?      <br /></strong>This is a case where a parent is attached to a child file with the <em>DesignVisualization</em> classification.&#0160; In other words, the child is meant to provide a view for the CAD data.&#0160; The nice thing about this attachment type is that you can create them without increasing the version of the file.</p>
<p>The server will allow you to have design visualizations of any type, however many clients will only recognize DWF files.&#0160; It&#39;s also a good idea to avoid having more than one visualization attachment on a single file.</p>
<p><strong>What does a &quot;source&quot; mean?      <br /></strong>When you add or check-in a file, you set up your attachments and dependencies.&#0160; You pass in the File ID of the child file and you have to provide a &quot;source&quot; for the association.&#0160; A source is basically the application that &quot;owns&quot; the link.&#0160; Other applications are supposed to refrain from modifying the link.&#0160; A null value means that the link is not specific to an application.</p>
<p>The source concept was introduced specifically for the Inventor DWG feature, and I am not aware of any other uses.&#0160; Basically, it tells if an association is owned by Inventor or AutoCAD so that one app doesn&#39;t alter the other app&#39;s associations.    <br />The only legal values for a source are null, &quot;INVENTOR&quot; and &quot;AUTOCAD&quot;.&#0160; Any other value may lead to strange behavior in some clients (the server doesn&#39;t care).</p>
<p>The recommendation is to pass in null for new associations.&#0160; If you are preserving an existing association, just pass in the existing source.&#0160; Inventor and AutoCAD files should be added to Vault via through the CAD applications themselves.</p>

"It's also a good idea to avoid having more than one visualization attachment on a single file." - Why, what is the downside using this "feature" to associate several docs to a single parent without the need to create a new version of the parent?

Some of the CAD clients assume a single visualization.  If you check-out/check-in a CAD file, the client may only update the DWF and not create the visualization attachments on the new file version.

<p>Wouldn&#39;t it be nice to push Vault settings out to all the Vault users?&#0160; Saved searches, for example.&#0160; Or maybe a plug-in from your favorite Vault API blog.&#0160; If there was only some sort of centralized document repository that you could use to deploy these files from.</p>
<p>Oh wait, Vault is a centralized document repository.&#0160; Let&#39;s use it to push data out to clients....    <br /><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2010/Thunderdome/UpdatesFound.png" /></p>
<p><strong>Overview:      <br /></strong>Welcome to Project Thunderdome, my attempt to make local Vault settings into global Vault settings.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s start with the <strong>Users Folder</strong> concept, which Thunderdome sets up.&#0160; It works the same as with Windows, each user can get their own folder that only they have access to.&#0160; There is also a <strong>Default Folder</strong> which all users can read from.<img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2010/Thunderdome/UsersFolder-normal.png" /></p>
<p>The Administrator can place data in the Default Folder to have it pushed out to everyone with Project Thunderdome installed.&#0160; This can be used to push out just about any client setting (saved searches, grid state, shortcuts, etc) and other Vault Explorer extensions (<a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2010/05/watch-folder.html" target="_blank">Watch Folder</a>, <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2010/03/set-revision-iproperties.html" target="_blank">Set Revision iProperties</a>, etc).<img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2010/Thunderdome/UsersFolder-admin.png" /></p>
<p>And just for fun, I added a command that will let a user back up their Vault settings to their user folder in Vault.    <br /><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2010/Thunderdome/backupCommand.png" />&#0160;</p>

<p><strong>Beyond Thunderdome:</strong><strong> <br /></strong>I can see a bunch of uses for the &quot;Users Folder&quot; concept.&#0160; I&#39;m sure I will re-visit it in future sample apps.&#0160; You&#39;re also free to expand upon the concept however you see fit.&#0160; Let me know what you think.</p>

Hi Doug,
I think this is a very good example on how to deploy default settings. I was thinking of extending this to also deploy the CAD standards with it. Is it possible to impersonate another Windows user to have the deployed
"EXTENSIONS" or "CAD STANDARDS" out of editing possibilities of the regular users ?

Yes you can do impersonation, assuming you know the username/password of the user you are impersonating. 

This is more of a Windows API question.  As far as the Vault API is concerned, a Vault custom command can do anything that a .NET DLL can do.

Thanks for the feedback!  Yes I am planing on updating it for 2012, but I won't have time to get to it until May, at the earliest.

If you don't want to wait that long, you, or somebody that knows how to program, can download the source code and build an updated version.

<p>I&#39;d like to take a moment to talk about the Information Service and why it is unique.&#0160; You see, this is the only service compatible across multiple releases.&#0160; All other services are locked to a specific Vault release.&#0160; For example, a Document Service that talks to a Vault 2010 server will fail if you try to connect it to a Vault 2009 or Vault 2011 server.&#0160;</p>
<p>But not the Information service.&#0160; Starting with R5, all Information service functions have been compatible with the future release.&#0160; No need to re-compile or update the web reference.</p>
<p>The reason it works that way is because this service tells you the version of the Vault server.&#0160; Locking it to a specific version would have been self-defeating.&#0160; The main idea is that you can check with the Information service before you sign in.&#0160; If the server version doesn&#39;t match the version you expect, you abort the operation because you know that the sign in won&#39;t connect properly.&#0160; Not only can you get the version of the server, but you can tell which Vault product is running on the server.&#0160;</p>
<p><strong>GetSystemProducts</strong></p>
<p>GetSystemProducts() is the main function in the server.&#0160; The other functions are there for rare cases and backward compatibility, so you will probably not need to deal with them.&#0160; GetSystemProducts has some interesting behavior.&#0160; First, you get an array back, not a single value.&#0160; This array will contain the server product and all subset products.&#0160; So, a Vault Professional server will return 4 Products: Vault Professional, Vault Collaboration, Vault Workgroup, and Vault.&#0160; A base Vault server will just return the Vault object.</p>
<p>The ProductName value on the Product object is tricky.&#0160; Because of backward compatibility, this value resembles the original product name, which may not be the current product name.&#0160; You probably know that Productstream was the original name of Vault Professional, but did you know that Vault Professional was the codename for Vault Workgroup?</p>
<p>Here, let me demonstrate with a chart:</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" width="450">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="225"><strong>ProductName</strong></td>
<td valign="top" width="225"><strong>DisplayName (2011 release)</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="225">Autodesk.Vault</td>
<td valign="top" width="225">Vault Server</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="225">Autodesk.VaultPro</td>
<td valign="top" width="225">Vault Workgroup Server</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="225">Autodesk.VaultCollaboration</td>
<td valign="top" width="225">Vault Collaboration Server</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="225">Autodesk.Productstream</td>
<td valign="top" width="225">Vault Professional Server</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Lastly, there is the ProductVersion value.&#0160; This is a string with a 4 part version number corresponding to the build number of the Vault server.&#0160; For example &quot;1.0.3.200&quot;.&#0160; For some strange reason, Vault uses Inventor&#39;s primary build number.&#0160; So even though Vault 2011 is technically R9, it has a primary build number of &quot;15&quot;.</p>
<p>Anyway, the primary number is the only one you need to worry about.&#0160; The second build number is the service pack level, but the API does not change during service packs.&#0160; And the last two numbers are just increment values.</p>
<p>All the Product objects returned should have the same build number.&#0160; In the past, it has always been the same, and I don&#39;t see that ever changing.&#0160; The effort to test and support a mixed version server would be astronomical.</p>

<p>If you haven&#39;t read my <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2009/10/security.html" target="_blank">earlier article on security</a>, you might want to do that first.&#0160; This article is going to dig deeper into Vault&#39;s the security framework.&#0160; That&#39;s right, there&#39;s even more.&#0160; The good news is that the hard stuff is over.&#0160; Now that you know what an ACL is an how it&#39;s used to calculate the read, write and delete permissions, we can talk about how ACLs are hooked to files.</p>
<p><strong>Folder ACLs</strong></p>
<p>A folder can have an ACL on it.&#0160; That ACL will not only apply to the folder itself, but it also applies to any files in that folder.&#0160; If a sub-folder is created, it will inherit the ACL from the parent folder, but this can be changed later on.&#0160; When you change the ACL on a folder it immediately applies to the files in that folder.&#0160; There are also some options for propagating the changes to sub-folders.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2010/SystemACLs/folderSecurity.png" /> <br /><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2010/SystemACLs/folderSecurity2.png" />&#0160;</p>
<p><strong>System ACLs</strong></p>
<p>A file can have 2 ACLs on it.&#0160; One comes from its parent Folder and the other one is something called a System ACL.&#0160; If present, the System ACL overrides the Folder&#39;s ACL.&#0160; The 2 ACLs are not merged in any way.&#0160; The System ACL completely wins out.&#0160; So you may find cases where the folder says that the user has read only access, but they can edit certain files in the folder.</p>
<p>There are various ways to set the System ACL:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the Vault is not set up to use Item security, then the file&#39;s lifecycle state dictates the System ACL.      <br /><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2010/SystemACLs/fileLifecycle-scaled.png" /> </li>
<li>If the Vault is set up to use Item security, then the item&#39;s security settings dictate the System ACL.&#0160; This is only for cases where the file is linked to an Item and the Item is in the Released state.      <br /><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2010/SystemACLs/itemLifecycle.png" /> </li>
<li>The file&#39;s System ACL can be set explicitly in the Properties dialog under the file menu (not to be confused with the Properties grid).&#0160; Setting the System ACL in this manner will overwrite any file or item lifecycle security settings.&#0160; At the API level, you use SecurityService.SetSystemACLs().      <br /><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2010/SystemACLs/fileProperties.png" /> </li>
</ul>
<p>Regardless of how the System ACL is set, you can read it using SecurityService.GetEntACLsByEntityIds().&#0160; Even nicer is that the function returns both the regular ACL (the one from the folder security) and System ACL.</p>

Hi, i would like to edit the file security with .net.
i currently inherit the security from the folder, but with the functions addsystemacl and setsystemacl i cannot overwrite the files security settings.
Manually i would set the checkbox in the file properties "overwrite security" and modify them.
How could i get that with .net ?
thanks

Doug 
your statement
"Regardless of how the System ACL is set, you can read it using SecurityService.GetEntACLsByEntityIds().  Even nicer is that the function returns both the regular ACL (the one from the folder security) and System ACL."

Does this mean the reported folder security can then be applied to the file using SecurityService.SetSystemACLs().
therefore reseting the file security so that it does not use the system ACL applied from the lifecycle state change.
Basically I am looking to trigger a reset of the File security as the folder security is required and should not be bypassed by the file state security. Maybe we need to simply clear the file System ACL applied by the lifecycle state so that it then uses its folder ACL. 

I am hoping that you might be able to confirm that it is possible to use the API to control this on a state change?
We Need to apply and retain the folder security throughout our Vault!
It would be impossible to manage multiple catagories , lifecycles and states for each project , we already  have 25+ projects with potential for many more, each project is a individual client who's data security needs to be maintained at all times therefore we need the folder security to only allow specific user groups access to specific projects.

Any help with this would be great, Can it be done?
Example of the code would be very much appretiated

Clearing the system ACL will cause the file to revert to folder security.

If you don't ever want to use lifecycle security, you can just clear the security details on the lifecycle state settings.  That way you don't have to come up with an API solution.

Yes, you can update the ACL data through the API.  And you can trigger the code on a state change.  However permissions becomes a problem.  Only administrators can directly set ACL data.  So you would have to work around that problem.

Doug,

Is there a way to check the permissions of the current folder without using the standard method? everytime we wont to read the information in readonly mode we get a error 303.

sample code : Vault.Library.ConnectionManager.LogIn(servername, vaultname, "user", "Password", Vault.Currency.Connections.AuthenticationFlags.Readonly, null.

Reason for this question is that the standard methode requires a Vault License and we want to use this for all Vault users.
Regards Iwan

There are a few strange cases where you can't read data in Readonly mode.  ACL data is probably one of those cases.
Security is considered an administator function, so not much thought was put into read-only workflows. 

For a workaround, your app can do a Standard login, read the security and log out quickly.

<div>My first experience with programming dealt with Turtle Graphics. From there I caught the programming bug. I actually ended up going to my junior year in college without owning a computer. Even though I took computer classes in both High School and College and did rather well in them.<br /> <br /> I spend most of my time helping out in testing of the Vault product line. Lately, I have been spending time outside of work brushing up on my programming skills. It is amazing what can happen when you dust off those brain cells. I now help out with the API team.</div>

<p>Autodesk is an American company, which means there is no such thing as having too many legal disclaimers.&#0160; Therefore I would like to re-iterate parts of the <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/disclaimer.html" target="_blank">legal disclaimer</a> for this blog.&#0160;</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" width="450">

<p>In other words, you are free to use the applications (and source code) in your Vault, but the burden is on you to test and make sure it is suitable for your environment.&#0160; There is definitely a difference between my small development vault and a production Vault with hundreds of concurrent users.</p>

<p>Here are some code snippets to help you out when dealing with replicated environments.</p>
<p><strong>Finding out your local workgroup</strong></p>
<p>One of the first things you will probably want to do is figure out which workgroup you are connected to.&#0160; This one is pretty easy, just call <strong>GetLocalWorkgroup</strong>() in the ReplicationService.</p>
<p>If you want to get the list of all the workgroups connected to your local workgroup, you can call <strong>GetAllWorkgroups</strong>().&#0160; If replication is running, there should be only 1 publisher and the rest should be subscribers.</p>
<p><strong>Finding out the entity&#39;s owner</strong></p>
<p>The next thing you will probably want to do is figure out which workgroup owns the thing you want to work on.&#0160; The best way is to use <strong>GetOwnershipByEntityId</strong>.</p>

<p>For files, items and change orders you can use the &quot;Current Owner&quot; property, but the result is designed more for human readability.&#0160; It&#39;s not very good for program logic because there are a couple of string formats that are used depending on the workgroup settings.</p>
<p><strong>Error 322</strong> <br />This is the error you get whenever you try to do something on an Entity that you don&#39;t own.&#0160; You can minimize the chance of getting this error by checking the &quot;Locked&quot; property on the object.&#0160; However it won&#39;t hit all cases and some Entities don&#39;t have a Locked property.</p>
<p>First you need to detect the error.&#0160; You can do this the same way you look up any <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2009/11/errors-and-restrictions.html" target="_blank">other error code</a>.&#0160; There&#39;s nothing special here.</p>
<p>Next you need to decide how to handle the error.&#0160; This one is up to you and what make sense for your application.&#0160; Common options include A) displaying the error to the user and B) automatically attempt to gain ownership.</p>
<p><strong>Transferring Ownership</strong> <br />Here is how you transfer ownership of specific Entities.&#0160; You can transfer things in groups, which mean that all Entities in the group transfer or none do at all.&#0160; This feature is useful if you have a group of things that you need to work on.&#0160;</p>
<p>If you are transferring multiple groups, it&#39;s possible for one group to fail while another succeeds.&#0160; So you need to check the XferStatus to make sure the transfer succeeded.</p>

<p><strong>Using Newly Transferred Entities</strong> <br />So your code just transferred file ownership to your local workgroup.&#0160; You can start working on it, right?&#0160; <strong>Wrong!</strong></p>
<p>You need to wait for SQL to replicate the Entity data before you can start using.&#0160; The reason is because the Transfer function you called edited data on the <strong>remote workgroup</strong>, not your local workgroup.&#0160; Every other API function that edits data does the edit on the local database, but the Transfer functions are special.</p>
<p>So how do know when you have ownership for real?&#0160; The only way is to constantly check the ownership until it shows that your local workgroup owns it.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong>&#0160; These steps only work for the Vault 2011 version of the DLL.&#0160; <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2011/08/strong-named-dlls.html" target="_self">Go here if you are using Vault 2012</a>.</p>
<p>A couple of people have had issues with the fact that Autodesk.Connectivity.WebServices.dll is unsigned.&#0160; This is a problem if you want to sign your project.&#0160; Visual Studio won&#39;t let you sign something if it references an unsigned DLL.&#0160;</p>
<p>Fortunately, there is a trick you can use to sign the WebServices DLL.&#0160; The trick involves SN.exe, ILASM and ILDASM.exe, which are .NET tools provided by Microsoft. You basically de-compile the DLL to IL code, then you re-compile with a key.</p>
<p>Example BAT file:</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" width="450">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="450">
<p><span style="font-size: xx-small;">set assembly=Autodesk.Connectivity.WebServices              <br />set WinSDK=C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v6.1\Bin               <br />set NetDir=C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v2.0.50727</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: xx-small;">&quot;%WinSDK%\sn.exe&quot; -k keyfile.snk              <br />&quot;%WinSDK%\ILDASM.exe&quot; %assembly%.dll /out=%assembly%.il               <br />move %assembly%.dll %assembly%.1.dll               <br />&quot;%NetDir%\ILASM.exe&quot; %assembly%.il /dll /out=%assembly%.dll /key=keyfile.snk</span></p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>If all goes well, you will end up with a signed WebServices DLL.&#0160; The original DLL is still there, but it&#39;s been renamed with a &quot;.1.dll&quot; extension.</p>
<p>This trick will work with any .NET assembly, so don&#39;t let unsigned references prevent you from signing your project.</p>

Hello,

Using the above trick, i tried to sign the Vault Explorer 2011 extension DLL. Re-compile is possible but when using this signed DLL the explorer add-in isn't working anymore. It complains about missing assembly attribute ApiVersion.

Is it possible to get around this issue ?

You tried to sign Autodesk.Connectivity.Explorer.Extensibility.dll?  That's not a good idea because you are not the only one using that DLL.  Vault Explorer uses it too.  It's part of the Vault client install, so you shouldn't be modifying it.  Even if you do get your project to work, a hotfix or service pack could come along and re-write it.

The reason you can safely modify Autodesk.Connectivity.WebServices.dll is because it's not part of the Vault 2011 product.  

So I should amend my earlier statement.  You can sign DLLs yourself only if you are the exclusive consumer of that DLL.

Hello,

Please note that using a signed WebServices DLL is not a good idea when creating a job handler for the Vault job server. The custom job handler DLL must be copied in the \Explorer folder where an unsigned WebServices dll already resides. This dll has priority and should not be replaced resulting in a failing job handler. Also in this case you can say that you are not the exlusive consumer of the DLL.

<p><img src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/SampleApp2.png" /> </p> <p>One of the worst tasks you can get as a programmer is having to write an installer.&#0160; Installers are hard to write, hard to debug and hard to maintain.&#0160; What&#39;s worse is that nobody appreciates all the hard work you did.&#0160; As far as the end user (or your boss) is concerned, an installer is either &quot;adequate&quot; or &quot;a complete piece of garbage&quot;.&#0160; Those are the only 2 states.&#0160; There is no in-between and no way to go above adequate.&#0160; Nobody ever says, &quot;Wow! What a great installer!&quot;</p> <p>And don&#39;t even get me started on the MSI framework.</p> <p>Anyway, you may have noticed that most of my samples are deployed via an installer.&#0160; So I&#39;ve posted a simple Visual Studio 2008 installer project that you can use to deploy your custom Vault Explorer extensions.</p> <p><strong>Features:</strong></p> <ul>
  <li>Detects if Vault Collaboration, Workgroup or Professional client is installed and sets the [VAULTWGDIR], [VAULTCOLLABDIR] and [VAULTPRODIR] paths respectively.&#0160; If the path is empty, then it means that the client is not installed, and the path will be empty.</li>
  <li>Installer will not work if it doesn&#39;t detect one of the above mentioned Vault clients.</li>
  <li>Performs a menu reset, so your custom command <em>should</em> show up after the installer runs and your restart Vault Explorer.</li>
 </ul>

Hi Doug, 

First I´d like to congratulate you about the blog. It´s good to have access to these features. 
I have some doubts about work with API to program Custom Revision Schemes. How could I contact you about my doubt? Just using the Blog´s comment or do you prefer to send me your e-mail? 

Thank you a lot.

Best Regards,

If you are a member of the Autodesk Developer Network, then that is the best place to go.  They fully support the Vault API and can answer specific Vault API issues.  They can also give guidance on your program, such as advising you on the best approach or answering if what you have in mind is even possible with the API.

Hi Doug, 
I don't know if you can help me out but it would be very nice if you could.  The thing, I want to automate some processes in inventor. But I just can't make it work, that the document gets checked in automatically into  the vault. You know what I mean? an automated "script":open file -works fine, do some changes-works fine,check into vault-i just do not know how.

It would be very great if you had a clue.

Greeting and a nice weekend


Till Klingenberg-Scholle

Unfortunately, there is no easy way to automate the check-in of an Inventor file.  The file itself is easy to upload, but getting the file links and BOM data correct is very difficult.  We recommend only using Vault clients from Autodesk to upload Autodesk files. 

If you are writing an Inventor plug-in, the best thing you can do is invoke the check-in command, which brings up the check-in dialog.

Hello Doug, thank you for your answer. 
I thought it would be difficult. But I think I've got a solution.
1st step is to get all references from an iam-file.
2nd step is to upload all the child-data
3rd step is to read out all the file ids of the children (in vault)
4th step is to finally upload the iam with all the ids as dependencies.

Ok, thats just some kind of a scribble but i think i can do it.

For further clues I would be very very grateful

Best regards

Your steps are correct for the file dependencies, but there is still the issue of the BOM object.  If you don't provide a BOM, then Item data in Vault Professional will not be correct.

If you are not using Vault Professional and are sure that you will never use it in the future, only then you can pass in a null BOM.

There is also the issue of DWF.  The Vault plug-in creates DWF files when a file is checked in.  It can also be configured to queue up a DWF job or do nothing.

In any event, you will have to do plenty of testing to make sure that files you upload still work properly with the rest of the Vault applications.

Thank you very much. I am already struggling on the BOM-object.Well, this won't get easy. Is there any sample code that handles the BOM-object?!? I think first of all I need to read out the BOM-structure from Inventor (Item and quantity) and then go on and look how to use this knowledge with the BOM-Object...but first I GO ON HOLIDAY!!!!
Have a good time Doug and thank you for your hints.

Creating your own BOM for an Inventor file is a bad idea.  In order to work, you need to make sure you come up with the same BOM that the Vault plug-in does, and we haven't released any information on how that BOM is constructed.  So what you want to do is unsupported.

If you try to reverse engineer things, you will probably make a mistake or skip over a use-case.  The result might be quite costly, such as the wrong number of parts being manufactured.  It's just too risky.

We do have it as a wish-list item for the Vault plug-in to be able to silently check in a file, but I have no information on when this feature can get into a release.

Hi Doug, 
thank you for your reply.
Well, I think I better focus on other things than to mess with things that are such risky. But I remain looking forward for the silent check-in plug-in.

Hi Doug,
I realize this hasn't been commented on in a while, but hopefully you get a notice about a comment.

How can your installer template be updated to work with Vault 2012?  In searching my registry, I don't see the same registry values used to set the conditions.
Thanks

I should probably post my 2012 installer.  It's simpler than the 2011 version.  In 2012, all extensions go to the same location (%programData%\Autodesk\Vault 2012\Extensions) so I don't need any of the registry stuff to detect the location of the client install.

In installer terms, the [Application Folder] is what maps to ProgramData.  So you can build an installer from scratch just by doing a basic file dump.

<p>Replication is one of those &quot;game changer&quot; features.&#0160; It&#39;s a very powerful feature, but it has the potential to impact any customizations you write.&#0160; Code that works perfectly well in a single workgroup environment may behave incorrectly in a multi-workgroup environment.&#0160; Even worse, the incorrect behavior may be intermittent, making it hard to isolate what the exact problem is.</p>
<p>To illustrate my point, I&#39;d like to go over a bug that can show up when running <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2010/01/vault-mirror.html" target="_blank">Vault Mirror</a> in a multi-workgroup environment.&#0160; First, let me quickly go over how the Partial Mirror command works.&#0160; When you sync data in Vault Mirror, it remembers the time.&#0160; When you run a Partial Mirror command later, it does a search for all new files since the date of the last sync.&#0160; This way it only downloads down the new files.&#0160;</p>
<p>On a single workgroup, Partial Mirror works perfectly.&#0160; It will always find the all the new files added.&#0160; However in a replicated environment, it may miss files.&#0160; In these cases there are no errors or messages.&#0160; It just doesn&#39;t download all the files it&#39;s supposed to.</p>
<p>Let me describe the issue in detail.&#0160; In this example, there are 2 workgroups, A and B.&#0160; Vault Mirror is on workgroup A and is set to run a Partial Mirror every minute.&#0160; Also, in this example, a minute is about how long it takes to replicate SQL data between A and B.&#0160; Let&#39;s now add a file to workgroup B and see if Vault Mirror detects the new file.&#0160; Here is an example timeline:</p>
<ul>
<li>4:05:00 – Partial Mirror runs on site A. Scans for files with a CreateDate between 4:04:00 and 4:05:00.   <br /><span style="color: #800080;">Result: No hits</span> </li>
<li>4:05:32 – File X added to site B. </li>
<li>4:06:00 – Partial Mirror runs on site A. Scans for files with a CreateDate between 4:05:00 and 4:06:00.   <br /><span style="color: #800080;">Result: No hits</span> </li>
<li>4:06:28 – File X replicated to site A. CreateDate is still 4:05:32. </li>
<li>4:07:00 – Partial Mirror runs on site A. Scans for files with a CreateDate between 4:06:00 and 4:07:00.   <br /><span style="color: #800080;">Result: No hits</span> </li>
</ul>
<p>Did you see what happened there?&#0160; Because there is a delay replicating the file data from B to A, Vault Mirror was not able to detect the new file.&#0160; Another way to look at is is that the CreateDate doesn&#39;t accurately reflect the time when the file was added to the database.&#0160; There is not data field that will tell you the time of replication.</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p><strong>How to fix</strong></p>
<p>In my mind Vault Mirror already has a fix, the Full Mirror command.&#0160; It will catch any files that slip through the cracks.&#0160; In other words, if you run Full Mirror on Site A at 4:05, it&#39;s guaranteed to pick up all the files that are on Site A at 4:05.</p>
<p>Another solution is to construct 2 queries, one for replicated data and one for local data.&#0160; <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2010/05/watch-folder.html" target="_blank">Watch Folder</a> has this same bug, and I used this approach to fix.&#0160; The program remembers 2 sets of dates and uses them to run 2 separate queries.&#0160; Query 1:&#0160; Remember the last time the command was run, do a search on all new files owned by local workgroup since the time of the last command.&#0160; Query 2:&#0160; Remember the greatest CreateDate of a replicated file, do a search on all files not owned by the local workgroup since the saved date.</p>
<p>The second solution is not 100%, but I thought it was good enough for Watch Folder.&#0160; The second solution incorrectly assumes that each workgroup replicates at the same time.&#0160; Transferring ownership manually on files will also screw up this algorithm.</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>These are the only 2 solutions I can think of at the moment, but I&#39;m sure there are more.&#0160; The bigger concern is that there other potential bugs that can happen in a replicated environment.&#0160; This is just an example of one such bug, and the purpose is to get you thinking in terms of replicated data.</p>
<p>The best way to locate and fix these issues is to <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2010/08/replication---testing-on-a-single-server.html" target="_blank">test on a replicated environment</a>.&#0160; I don&#39;t think it&#39;s possible to catch these issues on a single workgroup.</p>

<p><img src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/Concepts2.png" /> </p> <p>Um... there is no 64-bit support if you are running inside Vault Explorer or Job Processor.&#0160; Those applications are built as 32-bit, which means any plug-ins are also 32-bit.&#0160; </p> <p>If you are writing a stand-alone application, then you can control how your app is built.&#0160; The default mode for .NET is to decide at runtime if it&#39;s 32-bit or 64-bit.&#0160; As long as you stay entirely in .NET, your code should work fine in either mode with no extra work on your part.&#0160; The problems come if you try to interface with non-.NET libraries, such as COM.&#0160;&#0160; </p> <p>The best advice I can give is to never assume anything about what mode you are running in.&#0160; Just because you are on a 64-bit machine does not mean the program is running as 64-bit, and just because the program is in Program Files (x86) doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s 32-bit.&#0160; In fact, don&#39;t even trust the first paragraph of this article.</p> <p>So what can you trust?&#0160; The answer is System.IntPtr.Size.&#0160; You can check this value at runtime to know for sure what mode you are running in.&#0160; From there you can write the appropriate logic, throw errors, etc.</p> <p>Autodesk.Connectivity.WebServices.dll is a pure .NET DLL, so it will work fine in either mode.</p>

<p>This is the first sample on my blog which is not written by me.&#0160; <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/Jim-McMullen.html">Jim McMullen</a> put this one together based on some customer requests.</p>
<p>The Parts List Tab is a file tab that will show any associated Item BOM data.&#0160; The idea is to make navigation easier because you are not constantly switching back and forth between File and Item views.</p>

Hi Doug, is there a possibility to define which columns should be shown?
That would round up the information to the most needed requests I heard in the field.
It should be not to hard to implement this in the source code (I'm not the .NET specialist :-) )

Hello Klaus,  

You should be able to modify the columns to what you want.  This would have to be done within the code.  Inside the "void_SetSelectObject" area is where I defined what goes into the column in this particular case.

Dear Sir, it's possible to see in the table the items B, C, D, with ther quantity. I can do that with recursive sql query but I have serious problem to do that with vb.net and autodesk vault library.
could you help me? Thanks Massimo

I think ItemService.GetItemBOMByItemIdAndDate is the function you want.  With this function you can get the entire BOM structure, which you can then use to calculate the quantity.

Thanks for your answer,
but with GetItemBOMByItemIdAndDate I get an array, after I have to implode the bom, the only way I know is to use a recursive sql query. So I have to create a stored procedure into sql and then call it in vb.net, but this is no easy way and autodesk don't want the user modify directly the db. Any idea? Thanks Massimo

GetItemBOMByItemIdAndDate gives you back arrays of Items and arrays of Item Associations.  From those two things you can construct the BOM tree.  You can then recurse through the BOM tree to calculate the data you need.

<p>&#0160;<img src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/TipsAndTricks2.png" /> </p> <p>Here is a common problem.&#0160; You have a custom command that you want people to use, but it does something that requires admin privileges.&#0160; Making everyone an administrator is a bad idea.&#0160; A better solution is for your command to perform an action as another user.</p> <p>Vault doesn&#39;t support a true impersonation model, but there is a workaround that works pretty well.&#0160; Just have your program log in as another user to perform the special task.&#0160; Log out as soon as the task is done and let the rest of the operations be performed by the logged-in user.</p> <p>Recycle Bin 2.0 makes liberal use of this technique.&#0160; The whole program rests on a special &quot;Recycle Bin&quot; folder where files go before they are deleted.&#0160; Obviously this folder needs to be locked down from normal use.&#0160; All interaction with the Recycle Bin folder needs to be through one of the custom commands.&#0160; To enforce this, the administrator needs to designate a special Recycle Bin User, which is the only one allowed to interact with the Recycle Bin folder.&#0160; Any time a Recycle Bin command is executed, the code logs in as the Recycle Bin user in order to interact with the folder.</p> <p><strong>Considerations:</strong></p> <p>First, your code needs a way to know how to log in as the impersonated user.&#0160; In practice the impersonated user is usually an administrator, so you have to keep the password hidden from the end user.&#0160; There are various ways to fix this.&#0160; You can hard-code the password, or you can encrypt the password and put it in a common location.&#0160; </p> <p>Next, there is the issue of licensing.&#0160; If you log in as two different users, you will consume 2 licenses.&#0160; If licenses are tight, then impersonation might not be an option.&#0160; Logging out the original user is not a good idea because what if all the licenses are used up when the operation is over an they try to log back in?&#0160; <br />The best approach is to use the impersonated user only as long as needed.&#0160; When the operation is over, log out immediately to free up the license.&#0160; If all goes well, it shouldn&#39;t have a noticeable impact on the licenses being consumed.   <br />Also, make sure to handle errors properly.&#0160; If errors come up during the operation, you still want to make sure the impersonated user get logged out at the end.</p> <p>Lastly, impersonation has an impact on data history.&#0160; Let&#39;s say you have an operation that uses impersonation to move a file to the Released state.&#0160; Later in time you want to see who released a certain file.&#0160; That becomes hard to do since the history of the item will show the impersonated user as the one who made the change.&#0160; What you want to see is the actual user.&#0160; <br />This can be solved by storing the actual user as a piece of meta-data, such as a UDP value.&#0160; It&#39;s not a perfect workaround because the data you want is not in the place where you expect it to be.&#0160; </p>

Thank's for the limited "magic wand".

I used it with Vault 2013 Pro. It's workung like desribed, but there is one thing that hurts me a little bit:
The KnowledgeVault database-entries for the subscriber are missing (SQL-Tables: Sites + VaultSite).

The effect of this is, that the same FielStore-path is use by both instances.

Is there a way to get the full functionality by manually adding the missing entries?

You shouldn't need to manually add any database entries.  The publisher/subscriber settings are done through the ADMS console.

<p><strong>Update:</strong>&#0160; The <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2011/08/vault-web-view-20.html" target="_self">Vault 2012 version</a> is available.</p>
<p>Here is a simple app which uses a custom tab view.&#0160; Vault Web View is an Internet Explorer control with a URL that is set on a folder by folder basis.&#0160; This is useful if you have data that is not in Vault, but is accessible through a browser.</p>

Hi Doug, I was wondering if this could be extended to display the HTML file content as Preview and possibly attaching URL's to files as well ( Product Description of Catalog Information on Items would be a nice add on as well ) Would this be supported by the API possibilities?

The Preview tab cannot be customized.  So any custom behavior needs to be done in a new tab.

If you have an HTML file in the vault, then you could modify this app to display the file contents in the Web View tab.

Yes, you can associate URL data to a file by creating a user defined property.  Next you could modify the app to display the URL from the file property.

<p>There are a couple of features on this blog that I want to make sure everybody knows about.</p>
<p>First, at the top and bottom is a <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/sitemap.html" target="_blank">sitemap</a> link.&#0160; The site map is just a quick listing of all the major posts, grouped by category.&#0160; I find this to be better way of finding things than the date-based approach that blogs use.</p>
<p>Next, I have a <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/spotlight/" target="_blank">Spotlight</a> section, which has the intent of showcasing interesting things that people outside Autodesk are developing using the Vault API.&#0160; So far, there is only 1 entry, and it is from almost a year ago.&#0160; If I don&#39;t get more entries soon, I&#39;ll close the section down.  <br />Your application doesn&#39;t need to be a for-sale product.&#0160; Maybe you created a tool for internal use, or you did a consulting job.&#0160; I still want to hear about it and feature it.&#0160; <br />If you are interested in sharing what you did, let me know in the comments section.&#0160; I will then get in touch with you over email.</p>

<p><img src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/Concepts2.png" /> </p> <p>Replication.  <br />Replication.   <br />Also known as Connected Workgroups, Replication is the feature where you can create multiple, working copies of the Vault database.&#0160; The main reason you would want to do this is if you have multiple locations working on the same vault where your network latency is too large between locations.&#0160; Replication speeds things up by allowing users to work exclusively with their local location.&#0160; In the background, the data gets synchronized with the other site.&#0160; This article will go into more details on this process because it has an impact on application development.</p> <p>To understand Vault replication, you need to first understand the SQL Server replication since that is the underlying technology.&#0160; As a rule, I try to avoid database details.&#0160; But for replication, that rule is trumped by a bigger rule: <em>Give developers the information they need to write Vault applications.&#0160; </em></p> <p><strong>SQL Server Replication</strong>   <br />In a nutshell, the concept is that you have separate databases on separate servers with the same data.&#0160; This sounds simple, but it&#39;s actually one of the most complex things in database programming.&#0160; </p> <p>As you probably already know, most of the Vault data is in a database.&#0160; So when you are viewing the Where Used on a part file, for example, you are just seeing a representation of a bunch of database rows.&#0160; What SQL Server does is keep track of all the rows that change.&#0160; These changes then get transferred to the other SQL Servers via a background process, and that&#39;s how data stays in sync.</p> <p>One important thing about this transfer: <strong>it is not instantaneous</strong>.&#0160; Even if you have a fast connection, you can expect there to be a delay of at least 1 minute before changes get transferred.&#0160; This delay can also be longer if you have a slow connection or the network is under heavy load.&#0160; </p> <p>Here is where things start getting complex, because it&#39;s possible for data to be legal in one SQL Server but illegal when replicated.&#0160; For example, in Vault, two people on different workgroups add a file called A.dwg to the same folder at the same time.&#0160; Everything works fine until the data is replicated.&#0160; Now you have two files with the same name in the same folder, which violates the rules on how Vault data should be structured.&#0160; Problems like these are called <strong>conflicts</strong>.&#0160; </p> <p><strong>Ownership</strong>  <br />There are various ways to deal with conflicts.&#0160; For Vault, we took the approach of preventing conflicts from happening in the first place.&#0160; We do this through the concept of <strong>ownership</strong>.&#0160; If you want to make <span style="text-decoration: underline;">any</span> edit in Vault, your workgroup needs the proper ownership.&#0160; So my earlier example is not possible.&#0160; You can only add A.dwg to a folder if your workgroup (aka. SQL instance) has ownership of the folder.&#0160; The workgroup without ownership will get an error if the try to add a file to the folder (also, the folder will show up as locked).</p> <p>The granularity of ownership varies depending on what you are working with.&#0160; There&#39;s the concept of <strong>Entity Ownership</strong>, where a workgroup has control of specific entities.&#0160; Files, folders, items and change orders are the only entities that can be owned in this way.&#0160; Everything else uses the concept of <strong>Database Ownership</strong>, which means that a workgroup owns all data in the database which is not controlled via entity ownership.&#0160; This covers things like property definitions, users, groups, categories, and so on.&#0160; Mostly administrator settings are controlled this way.</p> <p>Transferring ownership between two workgroups involves a handshake between the two servers.</p> <ol>
  <li>Workgroup A has ownership.</li>
  <li>Workgroup B requests ownership from A.</li>
  <li>Workgroup A changes ownership to B.&#0160; But this change is only recorded in A&#39;s database.</li>
  <li>Data is replicated to B via the SQL Server background process.</li>
  <li>Workgroup B has ownership. </li>
 </ol>
 <p>Some things to note about this process:</p> <ul>
  <li>Ownership transfer is not instant.&#0160; The requesting workgroup needs to wait for a replication cycle before it has ownership.</li>
  <li>Between steps 3 and 4 things are in a strange state.&#0160; A thinks B has ownership and B thinks A has ownership.&#0160; Effectively, this means that nobody has ownership.</li>
 </ul>
 <p><strong>Leases</strong>  <br />The last concept I want to talk about here is the <strong>lease</strong> concept.&#0160; Basically a lease prevents ownership from being transferred for a set length of time.&#0160; The rationale is that if you just grabbed ownership of something, you probably want to work on it for a while.&#0160; You don&#39;t another workgroup grabbing it away from you a few seconds later.&#0160; So when you transfer ownership, you set a lease period.&#0160; Until that lease expires, nobody can change the ownership.&#0160; Once the lease expires, it is still owned by the same workgroup.&#0160; Only when another workgroup requests ownership will the ownership change.</p> <p>I think by default you have a 1 day lease on entities you create.&#0160; If you grab ownership from somewhere else, you get a 1 hour lease.&#0160; If you have ownership of something, you can fully edit the lease.&#0160; You can extend or shorten the lease time.&#0160; You can remove the lease on an item or you can add a lease on something that does not have one.&#0160; You can&#39;t edit the lease of something not owned by your workgroup.</p>

  <li>Multi-user issues.&#0160; Only 1 person can run a command at a time, since only 1 person can check out the file at a time.&#0160; If you want to guarantee only 1 user at a time, this is a good thing.&#0160; But for most commands, you want to allow multi-user workflows. </li>
  <li>Error handling.&#0160; If something goes wrong, the file might get stuck in a checked out state.&#0160; This will effectively prevent anyone else from running the command until the the checkout is undone.&#0160; In Recycle Bin&#39;s case, the undo checkout has to be done manually by an administrator.</li>
  <li>Replication.&#0160; If you are running in a connected workgroup environment, your site needs ownership of the file in order to check it out.&#0160; Recycle Bin gets around this by logging in to the workgroup that owns the file.&#0160; The downside is that operations are slower on other sites.</li>
  <li>Historical versions.&#0160; Every edit results in a new version of the file.&#0160; This means that you constantly need to purge old versions to avoid needless clutter.&#0160; On the plus side, there may be cases where you want to go back a version or two. </li>

Hi Doug Redmond
Can you enable the option restore from RecycleBin for user, or remove option send to recycle bin, and there's no command to delete it?
Or disable the delete command when install it for administrator?
Thanks

<p>Update:&#0160; The <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2012/12/vault-query-2013.html" target="_self">Vault 2013 version</a> is now available.&#0160; Sorry, there is no 2012 version.</p>
<p>Time for another sample application.&#0160; This one is built specifically to help out Vault programmers, however I suspect that people will find other uses.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, Vault Query lets you make direct calls to the Web Service API.&#0160; The results are then displayed in a tree view, similar to the Visual Studio debugger.&#0160; This is a good way to sift through complex data, such as property mappings, lifecycle states or BOM data.</p>
<p>Just for fun, I decided to write this in WPF and give it an awesome UI.&#0160; <br /><a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2010/VaultQuery/Screenshot.png" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2010/VaultQuery/Screenshot_scaled.png" style="border: 0px none;" /></a>   <br /><span style="color: #808080;">(click image for full view)</span></p>
<p><strong>Requirements:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>To use the EXE   
<ul>
<li>.NET 3.5 </li>
<li>Vault 2011 Server (any version) installed on the network. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>To use the source code   
<ul>
<li>Visual Studio 2010 </li>
<li>Expression Blend 3 or 4 </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/Apps/VaultQuery/VaultQuery-1.0.1.0-bin.zip">Click here to download the application</a>   <br /><a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/Apps/VaultQuery/VaultQuery-1.0.1.0-src.zip">Click here to download the source code</a></p>
<p><strong>To use:   <br /></strong>This is a stand-alone EXE, so you don&#39;t need the Vault Client installed.&#0160; </p>
<p>On the left you have a list of operations.&#0160; Each operation represents a single web service call with specific input parameters.&#0160; Double click on the operation and it runs.&#0160; The output is presented in the right pane.</p>
<p>I set up a bunch of operations out-of-the-box, but you can add your own.&#0160; You can either use the &quot;Add Actions&quot; command or edit the Operations.xml file.&#0160; In theory, any API call can be made into an operation.&#0160; However the UI is picky about what input types it supports.&#0160; You may need to edit Operations.xml for many cases.</p>

BODY:
<p><img src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/Concepts2.png" /> </p> <p>Despite what some Americans may think, not everybody speaks English.&#0160; So it&#39;s sometimes a good idea for your Vault command to support multiple languages.&#0160; Since your command is a plug-in and not an EXE, there are some complications.</p> <p><strong><br />Satellite Assemblies:</strong> <br />Vault Explorer localization is based on the .NET concept of <em>Satellite Assemblies</em>.&#0160; If you are not familiar with that concept, you way want to read the relevant MSDN articles.</p> <p>In a nutshell, satellite assemblies are DLLs that contain the localized strings and dialogs for a specific language or locale.&#0160; At run time, every time a resource is needed, .NET attempts to find it in the appropriate satellite assembly.&#0160; If the resource is not found, the default resource is used.&#0160; The OS language is used to determine which satellite assembly to use.</p> <p><strong><br />Vault Explorer and your custom command:</strong> <br />For Vault Explorer, the default language is English.&#0160; If you install the English version of Vault, you get no satellite assemblies.&#0160; If you install a non-English version of Vault, you get everything the English install has plus the satellite assemblies for the install language.</p> <p>So you&#39;ve written a custom command for Vault Explorer.&#0160; For sake of demonstration, let&#39;s say you&#39;ve set up satellite assemblies for all the major languages.&#0160; Your control is .NET so it follows the .NET localization mechanism.&#0160; At runtime the <strong>OS language</strong> determines which satellite assembly is use.&#0160; <strong>The Vault install language is not a factor</strong>.</p> <p>This can lead to some interesting results.&#0160; Here a chart with some example set-ups and their results:</p> <table border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" width="450"><tbody> <tr> <td valign="top" width="95"><strong>OS Language</strong></td> <td valign="top" width="107"><strong>Vault Install Language</strong></td> <td valign="top" width="105"><strong>Vault Runtime Language</strong></td> <td valign="top" width="141"><strong>Custom Command Runtime Language</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td bgcolor="#ffc0cb" valign="top" width="95">English</td> <td bgcolor="#ffc0cb" valign="top" width="107">English</td> <td bgcolor="#ffc0cb" valign="top" width="105">English</td> <td bgcolor="#ffc0cb" valign="top" width="141">English</td> </tr> <tr> <td bgcolor="#ffc0cb" valign="top" width="95">German</td> <td bgcolor="#ffc0cb" valign="top" width="107">English</td> <td bgcolor="#ffc0cb" valign="top" width="105">English</td> <td bgcolor="#ffc0cb" valign="top" width="141">German</td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top" width="95">English</td> <td valign="top" width="107">German</td> <td valign="top" width="105">English</td> <td valign="top" width="141">English</td> </tr> <tr> <td bgcolor="#ffc0cb" valign="top" width="95">German</td> <td bgcolor="#ffc0cb" valign="top" width="107">German</td> <td bgcolor="#ffc0cb" valign="top" width="105">German</td> <td bgcolor="#ffc0cb" valign="top" width="141">German</td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top" width="95">French</td> <td valign="top" width="107">German</td> <td valign="top" width="105">English</td> <td valign="top" width="141">French</td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p>There is a pattern that emerges.&#0160; Vault runs as English (default language) if the install language doesn&#39;t match the OS language.&#0160; The custom command matches the OS language.&#0160; So we can create a more abstract grid...</p> <table border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" width="450"><tbody> <tr> <td valign="top" width="95"><strong>OS Language</strong></td> <td valign="top" width="107"><strong>Vault Install Language</strong></td> <td valign="top" width="105"><strong>Vault Runtime Language</strong></td> <td valign="top" width="141"><strong>Custom Command Runtime Language</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td bgcolor="#ffc0cb" valign="top" width="95">X</td> <td bgcolor="#ffc0cb" valign="top" width="107">X</td> <td bgcolor="#ffc0cb" valign="top" width="105">X</td> <td bgcolor="#ffc0cb" valign="top" width="141">X</td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top" width="95">X</td> <td valign="top" width="107">Y</td> <td valign="top" width="105">English</td> <td valign="top" width="141">X</td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p>NOTE:&#0160; The highlighted configurations are the ones supported by Autodesk.</p> <p>&#0160; <br /><strong>Deployment:</strong></p> <p>Vault has several different language installs which are released at different times.&#0160; However your control doesn&#39;t have to follow this pattern.&#0160; In most cases, it will probably be easiest to support all your languages in a single deployment.&#0160; In other words, all the satellite assemblies are deployed at the same time.</p> <p><strong><br />Testing:</strong></p> <p>If you have an English OS and want to test out your localization, it can be a bit tricky to switch your OS language.&#0160; Changing the locale formats and keyboard settings in the Control Panel does <strong>not</strong> change the OS language. First you need to install the appropriate language pack.&#0160; Next, you need to set the “Display Language” from the Control Panel localization, which requires a reboot or re-login.</p> <br /> <p>That&#39;s all I have for this article.&#0160; Auf Wiedersehen. </p>

Pass in null to the &#39;<em>propertyDefIds</em>&#39; parameter.&#0160; It will return all PropDefInfo objects and it will remove the admin requirement.</p> <table border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" width="450"><tbody>   <tr>    <td valign="top" width="450">     <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;

FindPropertyDefinitionsBySystemNames is the API function to use and it&#39;s pretty straightforward in how it works.&#0160; The trick is finding the system name.&#0160; In the properties dialog, you can customize the columns to show the system name of each property definition.</p> <p><img src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2010/PropertiesInVault2011/SystemNameColumn_scaled.png" /> </p> <p>Note that the systems names are nice and simple.&#0160; However any UDPs that you create will have a randomly generated GUID attached to them.&#0160; So the system name is not a good way to look up UDPs.</p> <p><strong>How to look up a mapped property</strong>   <br />Sometimes all you care about is the file property and you want to see the vault PropDef that has a read mapping to that file property.&#0160; Hardcoding the system name isn&#39;t helpful since UDP names and property mappings may change from vault to vault.</p> <p>What you need is to find the moniker for the file property and use that file to find the vault PropDef.&#0160; Note: there may be no mappings or multiple mappings to the file property.</p> <table border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" width="450"><tbody>   <tr>    <td valign="top" width="450"><span size="2;" style="font-family: Courier New"><span style="line-height: 115%;

Instead I recommend the following:</p> <ol>
  <li>Create a new UDP and map it to the property within the file. </li>
  <li>Write a code snippet that gets the PropDefInfo object for your UDP. </li>
  <li>In the debugger expand out the <em>EntClassCtntSrcPropCfgArray</em> of the PropDefInfo object. </li>
  <li>You should be able to find the mapping along with the moniker value. </li>
  <li>Copy the moniker value into your code. </li>

Hello.  Is there a way to ensure that when using batch plot all the iproperties and mass properties are updated?  I ask because lately when a project is finished and someone wants a set of drawings, the batch plot command prints out every bill of material in every drawing differently- some with the iproperties right in the BOM and some with no properties.  Often times the BOM is right but in assemblies the mtotal mass still says "NA".  I can print out each drawing individually and update all properties one at a time, but if there are 100 drawings in a set that can take hours on end.

You can't alter the batch plot command.  
One option is to write your own batch plot command.  That way you can control exactly what gets plotted.

If you think Vault is incorrectly plotting the wrong data, please let our product support team know.

If a UDP is mapped from Vault to the document only, UpdateFileProperties will still work, right?

That depends on what you mean by working.  The value should update properly in Vault.  But the file itself will still have the old value.  File modification always has to be done client-side.

The first parameter to UpdateItemProperties should be an array of Revision IDs.  You are passing in the selection ID, which is the the Item ID.  Item ID is different than Revision ID.
Call GetItemsByIds to find the Revision ID.

See this article for more info on selection.Id values:  <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2011/06/file-versions-and-links-in-the-selection-set.html">http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2011/06/file-versions-and-links-in-the-selection-set.html</a>

Did you call EditItem before calling UpdateItemProperties? 
If you want to see an example, go to the Vault Customization discussion group:  <a href="http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/Autodesk-Vault-Customization/Populating-Item-UDPs/m-p/3643626/highlight/true#M1018">http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/Autodesk-Vault-Customization/Populating-Item-UDPs/m-p/3643626/highlight/true#M1018</a>

Thanks for your answer,
all is working for udp
but why the property 60 'Description (Item, CO)' can't be edited in the same way?

Description is a system property.  You can't edit those directly.  File Size is a better example.  The system automatically handles that value.  It makes no sense to update that value with an UpdateProperties function.  

Also, don't assume that Description will have a value of 60.  That might not be true for all Vaults, and it might not be true if you upgrade to the next release.  Use the system name if you want a reliable key.

I have a few questions, we have a custome UDP called Title which contains information from various title blocks in inventor and autocad.  Is there a way to retrieve this property for a file from vault easily? 

  a .GetPropertyByFileID(FileID, "Title") sort of function?

Hello Doug,
We have situation which lead to conclusion that properties update makes file ‘dirty’, that’s mean trigger checked out/update/bump the version any other assembly using  this file.
The issue is explained below with two scenarios:
Scenario 1:
1.	open file from the vault (no files in C-drive workspace) 
 
2.	Hit OK  for Check-out the file:
 
3.	Message will appear about updating the properties:" Some prperties in the file ... may be out of the date. Would you like to update properties now?"
 

4.	For this Scenario 1 choose “Yes”, and the result :file is dirty (with*):
 

Scenario 2:
1.	open the same file from the vault (no files in C-drive workspace ) 
 
2.	Hit OK for Check out the file.
 
3.	Message will appear:" Some prperties in the file ... may be out of the date. Would you like to update properties now?"
 
4.	For this Scenario 2 choose “No”, and result is file is clean:
   
 
Conclusion: properties updates make files dirty and it constantly dirty every time when this file is checked-out.

Qestions:
1.	How to fix issue with constant ‘dirty’ files after updating properties?
2.	Where  to start to resolve this?
3.	How to see which particular properties are ’out of the date?’


Thank you

Yes, an update of properties results in a new file version.

It sounds like your issues are with the product itself and not the API.  I suggest posting your questions to the Vault discussion group:  <a href="http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/Autodesk-Vault/bd-p/101">http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/Autodesk-Vault/bd-p/101</a>

Is it possible to update the Comment field of an earlier version. The...our...revision table is set to use the comment field as the Description of the changes made. However, human error as it is...people sometimes forget to enter the changes before clicking OK when changing the state back to Released. I'd like to be able to right click on a version and add those comments after the fact. I have my extension to the point of adding comments to a form...I just can't figure out how to persist those comments to the drawing file.

Sorry, you can't edit historical comments.  
I recommend making Comment a required property and putting a condition on the state change that Property Compliance must be true.  That will prevent people from releasing files that have an empty comment.

"A comment string set by the user. If CheckedOut is true, then this property contains the comment set during checkout. If CheckedOut is false, then this property contains the comment set during check-in. Checking in a file, resets the comment for that version." Taken from the VaultAPI documentation. Reading that, shouldn't I be able to check out the version in question and update the comment on check in. Will this create a new version? In essence rolling back the part or will it just update that version?

No, because the new version is created at checkout time, not checkin time.

For example, you add a new file to vault.  So there is only one version of the file.  When you run the checkout command, v2 is immediately created.  The checkout comment is on v2 and v1 has the comment that was provided when the file was initially added.

<p><img src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/TipsAndTricks2.png" /> </p> <p>When programming with Vault, you end up dealing with arrays a lot.&#0160; I find myself constantly looping through arrays trying to find the 1 object I am looking for.&#0160; Or I have an array of objects that I need to convert to an array of IDs.</p> <p>.NET 3.0 has a nice feature, LINQ, that makes these operations much easier than creating foreach loops all the time.&#0160; It&#39;s basically a query syntax for .NET collections.&#0160; If you are a fan of SQL, then you should have no trouble picking up LINQ.&#0160; Even if you are unfamiliar with SQL, the syntax is pretty easy to work with.&#0160;&#0160; </p> <p>For example, let&#39;s say you want to find a specific property definition in an array of PropDef objects.</p> <table border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" width="450"><tbody>  <tr>  <td valign="top" width="450">   <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;

The "var" keyword is pretty hard to avoid when using anonymous types; and anonymous types can be quite convenient at times when using LINQ.

<p><img src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/Concepts2.png" /> </p> <p>This article will focus on Item properties, so feel free to skip this one if you are not using Vault Professional or do not use Items.&#0160; If you haven&#39;t read the article on <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2010/05/entities.html">Entities</a>, you might want to do that first.&#0160; And, obviously, parts <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2010/06/properties-in-vault-2011---part-1.html">1</a> and <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2010/06/properties-in-vault-2011---part-2.html">2</a> should be read. </p> <p><strong>Item Properties</strong>  <br />Items is one of those features where the UI makes it look like things work one way, but at the API level, things are completely different.&#0160; Unmapped Item UDPs are pretty straightforward.&#0160; It&#39;s when you get into mapped properties that things get confusing.</p> <p>For example, take the following workflow:</p> <ol>
  <li>Create a new Property</li>
  <li>Associate it to File and Item</li>
  <li>Set up the File mappings</li>
  <li>Save the Property</li>
  <li>Upload a file with the property in it.&#0160; The UDP contains the expected value.</li>
  <li>Assign the file to an item.&#0160; </li>
  <li>The item does not contain the UDP value like you might expect.&#0160; The reason is that you still need to set up the Item mapping.&#0160; The file value doesn&#39;t automatically copy over to the item just because the Item box is checked on the property.</li>
 </ol>
 <p><strong>Mappings</strong>  <br />Items also support mapping between UDP and a Content Source Property.&#0160; But the meaning is different for Items.&#0160; <strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Item properties do not map to data within the file.</span></em></strong>&#0160; </p> <p>You know that &#39;bom&#39; parameter on the add and checkin functions?&#0160; That&#39;s what Item properties map to.&#0160; The BOM contains bill of materials data for the file.&#0160; The central objects in the BOM are the BOMComp objects.&#0160; BOMComp objects can map to Item objects.&#0160; Therefore BOMProp objects are what the Item UDPs map to.</p> <p><strong>Content Source Providers</strong>  <br />So Item properties still have the concept of a content source property.&#0160; But the file&#39;s BOM is the content source in this case, not the file itself.&#0160; Again, the content source provider is the glue that hooks the content source property to the UDP.&#0160; So depending on the file type, the Item mapping behavior may be different.</p> <p><strong>Reference Designators</strong>  <br />This is the only other entity class that supports property mappings.&#0160; Just like with Items, a Reference Designator property maps to data in the BOM.&#0160; The only difference is that the mapping is to BOMProp data on a BOMRefDesig object.</p> <p>AutoCAD Electrical is the only application that sets reference designator BOM data.&#0160; So mappings are only possible with the content source provider that handles .dwg files.&#0160; </p><p><strong>Next up...</strong><br />In the fourth and final article, sample code!</p>

Hello Doug,

first of all I want to pay respect for your create blog. It is very informative and helps me along with my work. But I've got one question; Is there a possibility to change Content Source Properties? e.g. I made a custom tab with different properties displayed in it, some are user defined, others are system props. well, changin user defined props and updating them isn't that difficult. But when it comes to change the title in a dwg block I fail. Do you have a clue?? I'd be very grateful.

Best Regards

Till Klingenberg-Scholle

You can edit the content source property, but not through the Vault API.  You need to edit the CAD file directly using the appropriate CAD API.  

Here are the basic steps:
1. Check out the file through the Vault API.
2. Update the property in the local file through the CAD API.
3. Check in the file through the Vault API.

Hi Doug

I am not sure if I understand that correctly, could you enlighten me...?

I create a UDP and assign it to file and item. It shall be a property that the user must provide through the Vault Explorer, so there is no Property Provider for it. How can I map this UDP to an item UDP...?

Thanks, Tobias

Let me restate the question to make sure I understand:  You have a UDP associated with "FILE" and "ITEM" entity classes.  The UDP has no file or item mappings.  The user enters the UDP value on the file, and you want the same value on the UDP of the item which is linked to the file.

That functionality is not supported.  Associating a UDP to "FILE" and "ITEM" just means that the property <i>definition</i> can be applied to both items and files.  It does not mean that the property <i>values</i> can be mapped.

Of course, you can fix things up with custom programming.  You can have a utility set the item UDP, or the utility can find the file UDP value for a given item.

Thanks for good post. 
We are working with File BOM and we are encountering ugly exception. 
We are using function to read BOM <b>DocumentService.GetBOMByFileId</b> and very often we get exception <b>Eplan.Vault.Base.Exceptions.VaultException: [0:UnspecifiedSystemException]</b>.
Do you have any experience with this kind of problem?

Thanks,

I can't reproduce on my end, so I need some more information.

What Vault product are you using?
When exactly does error 160 pop up?  Is it when you click the "OK" button on the Configure Recycle Bin dialog?

The Recycle Bin User Server cannot be "localhost" or "127.0.0.1", but it should accept all other values.  What value are you trying to set?

All the Vault errors come from the server as error codes and none of my sample apps translate the codes into human readable messages.  So you have to look up the codes yourself in the SDK documentation.

Error 311, means that the application using the wrong authentication type.  The user you use to run Recycle Bin cannot be an Active Directory user.

You were right about the Active Directory user problem.  I had configured Recycle Bin to use my own user name and password.  I have since configured it to use a Vault user name and password.  Now I'm having a problem where when I try to add a file to the recycle bin the GetManafest method is throwing an error "Cannot check out now. (MachineName) is currently performing a recycle bin operation."  What are some troubleshooting steps to resolve this type of problem?

In Vault Explorer, turn on the setting that allows you to view hidden files.  You will see a file called RecycleBinManifest.xml in the Recycle Bin folder.  Undo the checkout on the file and that should fix things.  You may need to give yourself edit permissions in the Recycle Bin folder.

If you want more technical details, see <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2010/07/storing-custom-data-hidden-files.html">http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2010/07/storing-custom-data-hidden-files.html</a>

The "Restore from Recycle Bin" command should be enabled for all users.  The "Restore from Backup Vault" is designed for admins only.

For non-admins the Delete command is removed, but not for admins.  If you want to remove it from admin too, you would need to edit the source code.

You can also block deletes using folder security.  So the command will still be there, but the operation will fail.

Hi Doug,
I was watching the Webinar and collected all the information about the good/bad in the sample application.
I was wondering if the reroute of the "Deleted Files" to the "Backup Vault" would not cure a lot of the problems.

If the files would be placed in the BackupVault in Folders with a Date and Time stamp it would cure the file naming topic.

Maybe we can have another discussion about tips on the phone during the next weeks - Please let me know when I can call you - Thank you

Yes, that would fix many of the issues, but it would also not be a recycle bin at that point.  One feature I liked in both Recycle Bin 1.0 and 2.0 is that if you accidentally put something in the bin, you can easily get it back before the bin is emptied.

Hi Doug,

Quick Question; when review the comments I noticed you stated that it would NOT work with active directory users. Is this true. Our current Vault set-up utilizes users by active directory/windows accounts. Does this mean we can not use this?

Thanks,

No, it doesn't work with 2014.  I was never very happy with how the app turned out, so I didn't update it past Vault 2011.  Recycle Bin was buggy and didn't work in some Vault configurations. 

The source code is available, so it is possible for somebody with programming knowledge to update the app for a later version of Vault.

Hi Doug,

I have a short question about the version 2.0.2.0 source code package. Where can I finde the ReplUtil class? Seems to be missing in the package and I can't find it anywehre. Maybe you have the file somewhere or give me just a snippet of the functions GrabEntityOwnership and GrabFolderOwenrship. Many thanks in advance.

It looks like I left out a project when I uploaded the source code.  You can download the missing project from here:  <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/Apps/JustOnesAndZerosWebServices/JustOnesAndZeros.WebServices.zip.abc">http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/Apps/JustOnesAndZerosWebServices/JustOnesAndZeros.WebServices.zip.abc</a>

Remove the extension ".abc" and unzip.  It should have all the missing source files.

<p>A while back I did a webcast titled <em>Introduction to Vault Programming</em>, which you can download from our <a href="http://www.adskconsulting.com/adn/cs/api_course_webcast_archive.php">webcast archive</a>.&#0160; However, I noticed that the two live demo parts don&#39;t show up properly.&#0160; So I decided to re-record the demos.</p>

<p><img src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/Concepts2.png" /> </p> <p>Before you read this, I suggest reading my post on <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2010/05/entities.html">entities</a> then reading <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2010/06/properties-in-vault-2011---part-1.html">part 1 on properties</a>.&#0160; If not, I&#39;m not legally responsible for any brain damage that may occur.</p> <p><strong>File Properties</strong>   <br />In my last article, I mentioned how the properties concept spans multiple entity classes.&#0160; However there are still implementation details that are unique to each class.&#0160; In this article, I will focus specifically on file properties.</p> <p><strong>Content Source Properties</strong>   <br />In the context of Files, a content source property represents a property within the file.&#0160; This might be a title block attribute from an AutoCAD file, or an iProperty from an Inventor file, or a structured storage property from a Microsoft Office file.&#0160; A property may even be something more abstract, such as the number of colors in a JPG file.&#0160; The point is that the property lives <em>inside</em> the file, and Vault needs a way to read and write this information.&#0160; </p> <p>As I mentioned in my last article, the content source provider is the glue that reads and writes content source properties from a file and maps them to Vault UDPs.&#0160; Because each file type is different, there are multiple providers, broken up by file type.</p> <p>The &quot;All Files&quot; provider is a special case.&#0160; It&#39;s the one that gets used when no other provider is available.&#0160; This provider works by using the Windows iFilter mechanism to read the content source properties.&#0160; If no suitable iFilter is found, then content source properties cannot be read for that file type.&#0160; The &quot;All Files&quot; provider cannot be used to write content source properties.</p> <p><strong>Mappings</strong>   <br />Content Source Properties are useless to Vault unless they are mapped to a UDP.&#0160; If you&#39;ve seen the Properties dialog, you have probably noticed a bunch of complex options.&#0160; </p> <p><img src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2010/PropertiesInVault2011/mappingtab_scaled.png" /> </p> <p>Mappings between content source properties and UDPs have a direction component.&#0160; You can have mappings from content to UDP, or from UDP to content, or bi-directional mappings.&#0160; Not all properties support all 3 mapping types.&#0160; The provider decides which mappings are supported.&#0160; When writing to content, there is a &quot;create&quot; option which means the provider can create the property in the file if the property does not already exist.&#0160; If the value is NO, the provider will only update an existing property.&#0160; </p> <table border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" width="450"><tbody>   <tr>    <td valign="top" width="225">Mapping Type</td>    <td valign="top" width="225">What it means for files</td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td valign="top" width="225">Content -&gt; UDP</td>    <td valign="top" width="225">When a file is versioned, the file property value is copied to the UDP value.</td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td valign="top" width="225">UDP -&gt; Content</td>    <td valign="top" width="225">When a &quot;writeback&quot; operation occurs in Vault, the UDP value is written to the file.&#0160; This process creates a new file version.</td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td valign="top" width="225">Bi-directional</td>    <td valign="top" width="225">UDP is updated with a new file version and the content property is updated on writeback. </td>   </tr>  </tbody></table> <p><strong>Setting up a mapping   <br /></strong>In order to set up the mapping, you must have a file that contains the content source property you want to map.&#0160; In Vault Explorer, you select the file, which can either be in Vault already or on your local disk.&#0160; Next, you are presented with the possible properties that you can map to.&#0160; Once you select the file property, you can choose the direction of the mapping.</p> <p>When you click OK, Vault updates the UDP with information about the mapped content source property.</p> <p><img src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2010/PropertiesInVault2011/ImportProperties.png" /> </p> <p>You should also notice that A) you can have several providers mapped to the same UDP and B) each mapping is independent of the other mappings.&#0160; A given file will map to 1 and only 1 provider, so there is no danger of conflict.&#0160; </p> <p><strong>Monikers</strong>   <br />This is a good time to talk about monikers.&#0160; A moniker is a string that the provider uses to locate the property.&#0160; Outside the provider, the moniker is just opaque metadata.&#0160; For example, &quot;15!{D5CDD502-2E9C-101B-9397-08002B2CF9AE}!nvarchar&quot; is the moniker that the Inventor provider uses to locate the Company iProperty.&#0160; That string is meaningless to you and me, it is meaningless to Vault and it is meaningless to the other providers.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; </p> <p>The only thing that Vault does with the moniker string is to store it with the mapped UDP.&#0160; Whenever Vault needs to read or write a content source property, it passes the moniker in to the provider so that it can locate the correct property.</p> <p><strong>Coming up...</strong>   <br />An article on <strong>item properties</strong>, followed by an article on <strong>common workflows</strong> (with sample code).</p>

Doug,
I'd like to share an opinion that I've heard on recent regional forum devoted to CAD usage:
"Autodesk creates great software but tells nobody about the fact".
Your series of articles is great!
Such articles may change the opinion. But may not change as well.
Does Autodesk have in plan to develop some books or courseware on Vaults?
There is the only book in store regarding Vault (regarding free Vault) but users need info about advanced Vaults.
It is a problem. Isn't it?

Thanks for the feedback.
Yes, we are planning on updating the Vault courseware.  I'm not sure when it will be out or what the content will be, but I do know it is being worked on.  So even though we have blogs, discussion groups and wikis, we haven't turned our backs on the popular "book" format.

Doug,

I understand for Autocad files that you have to go to the server console and index the attribute block (by name) in order for it to appear as a property.  Do you also have to enable content indexing service for attribute block properties to work correctly?  We don't run content indexing service, so I was wondering if that is why my attribute block properties still don't work, even after indexing the attribute block and mapping it to the appropriate UDP.

Thanks!

I don't think you need the content indexing service to get title block attributes.  But I am not 100% sure on that.  I suggest posting this issue on the Vault discussion group:  <a href="http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/Autodesk-Vault/bd-p/101">http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/Autodesk-Vault/bd-p/101</a>

<p><img src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/Concepts2.png" /> </p> <p>If you have upgraded to Vault 2011, you may have noticed some changes regarding how properties work.&#0160; And when I say &quot;some changes,&quot; I really mean &quot;many changes.&quot;&#0160; Actually, &quot;re-architecture&quot; is probably a better term to describe what we did to properties.</p> <p>If you read my <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2009/11/file-properties-explained.html">earlier article on properties</a>, feel free to forget it.&#0160; Some of it is still relevant, but some of it isn&#39;t.&#0160; So to make things easy, I&#39;ll just start over from the beginning.</p> <p>One more thing, make sure to read my <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2010/05/entities.html">article on Entities</a>.&#0160; The new property architecture doesn&#39;t even begin to make sense until you understand Entities.</p> <p><strong>At a High Level:</strong>   <br />Properties are a type of Behavior, which basically means it&#39;s a feature that works on Entities instead of specific object types.&#0160; There are 2 things we do with this concept:&#0160; 1) we consolidate the feature and 2) we allow data to be shared across entity types.</p> <p>These concepts can be seen on the Properties dialog (Tools menu-&gt;Administration-&gt;Vault Settings-&gt;Behaviors tab-&gt;Properties button).&#0160; Everything is in one dialog instead of being separated by File, Item and Change Order.</p> <p><img src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2010/PropertiesInVault2011/PropDef1.png" /> </p> <p>This dialog gives you a nice list of Property Definitions.&#0160; Notice how each definition is associated with 1 or more entity classes.&#0160; This is nice because you can define a property definition once and use it multiple places.&#0160; A property definition can only work with entity classes that it is associated with.</p> <p>You can also associate property definitions with categories.&#0160; This allows you to change the behavior of the property depending on the category that the entity is.&#0160; This feature allows for more specialization while still promoting reuse.</p> <p><a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2010/PropertiesInVault2011/PropDef2-full.png"><img border="0" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2010/PropertiesInVault2011/PropDef2-scaled.png" style="border: 0px none ;" /></a>   <br /><font color="#808080">(click image for the full size view)</font></p> <p><strong>System Properties and UDPs:</strong>   <br />Properties maintained by Vault are either System properties or User Defined Properties (UDPs).&#0160; The main difference is that UDPs values can be edited directly, and system property values are set by the system.&#0160; At the property definition level, system properties have only a few edit options.&#0160; Likewise, system properties cannot be added or deleted.&#0160; </p> <p><strong>Content Source Properties:</strong>   <br />Vault Properties do many things.&#0160; They fill in the data grids, they allow searching, they allow lifecycle state restrictions, etc.&#0160; All this is possible because Vault &quot;owns&quot; this data.&#0160; Vault keeps the data in its tables and indexes, and everything is organized to support the Vault features.&#0160; </p> <p>But what about properties not owned by Vault?&#0160; Those properties aren&#39;t organized by Vault and aren&#39;t in a format that Vault recognizes.&#0160; We refer to these as Content Source Properties because they are <strong>content</strong> form a <strong>source</strong> other than Vault.&#0160; So how can Vault work with this data?</p> <p>The solution is to map the content source property to a UDP.&#0160; That way Vault can do all it&#39;s operations on the UDP without having to know or care about the mechanics of the content source property. </p> <p>The glue between the content source property and the UDP is a module called a Content Source Provider.&#0160; It contains the logic to read and/or write content source properties and interact with the Vault framework.&#0160; These providers are broken up by file type.&#0160; So there is one for AutoCAD and one for Inventor and so on.&#0160; There is also an &quot;All Files&quot; provider to handle all files not claimed by another provider.</p> <p><strong>Coming Up...   <br /></strong>That&#39;s all I have for this article.&#0160; Next week, I&#39;ll go into some of the specifics of <strong>File properties</strong>.&#0160; Then after that, I&#39;ll post an article on <strong>Item properties</strong>.</p>

It depends on the system property.  For example, you can change the File Name property by checking out the file and checking in with a new name.  You can change the Category Name property by setting the category on the file, and so on.

In other cases, your actions may cause a system property value to change, but you don't have control over the new value.  Date Version Created and Version are examples of values set by the server.

<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #5acb04;" />
<p>In the Vault 2011 API, many of the features are driven by an Entity concept.&#0160; In fact, entire services use Entities as their common currency.&#0160; Specifically the Behavior, Category, Property, Replication, Revision and Security services.&#0160; So what are Entities?&#0160; How do you use them?</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" width="450">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="450">Quick Definition: An Entity allows a feature to be applied to multiple object types.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The closest analogy I can come up with is the Object base class in .NET.&#0160; It&#39;s kind of like a top-level base class which can be used to manipulated objects in an abstract way.&#0160;</p>
<p>For Vault, this means that there can be a single function that operates on multiple object types.&#0160; In earlier versions of Vault, separate functions had to be created for each item type.</p>
<p>For example, in Vault 2010, there are 5 functions for looking up property values:  <br /><span style="font-size: xx-small;">&#0160;&#0160; PropInst [] DocumentService.GetProperties (Long [] fileIds, Long [] propertyDefinitionIds)   <br />&#0160;&#0160; PropInst [] ItemService.GetItemProperties (Long [] itemIds, Long [] propertyDefIDs)    <br />&#0160;&#0160; PropInst [] ItemService.GetReferenceDesignatorProperties (Long [] itemRefDesIds, Long [] propertyDefIDs)    <br />&#0160;&#0160; PropInst [] ChangeOrderService.GetChangeOrderProperties (Long [] changeOrderIds, Long [] propertyListIds)    <br />&#0160;&#0160; PropInst [] ForumService.GetMessageProperties (Long [] messageIds, Long [] propertyListIds)</span> <br /> <br />In Vault 2011, the same functionality is contained in a single function:   <br />&#0160;&#0160; <span style="font-size: xx-small;">PropInst [] PropertyService.GetProperties (String entityClassId, Long [] entityIds, Long [] propertyDefIds)</span></p>
<p><strong>Not everything is an Entity</strong> <br />Most of the major objects are Entities, such as Files and Folders.&#0160; But some things are not, like Users and Groups.&#0160; I don&#39;t want to go into why some things are Entities and some things are not.&#0160; That explanation would require me to go deep into the database architecture.&#0160; <strong>The general rule is to assume that everything is not an Entity unless explicitly stated.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Some objects contain multiple Entities</strong> <br />A File object actually has 2 Entities contained inside it.&#0160; The &quot;File Version&quot; Entity and the &quot;File Master&quot; Entity.&#0160; These are uniquely identified by the Id and MasterId properties respectively.&#0160; The function parameter will usually tell you which ID to pass in.  <br />For Item objects, there are 3 Entities:&#0160; Item Version, Item Revision and Item Master.</p>
<p><strong>The list of Entities   <br /></strong>Here is the list of Entities that are in use for the Vault 2011 API:</p>
<ul>
<li>File Version </li>
<li>File Master </li>
<li>Folder </li>
<li>Item Version </li>
<li>Item Revision </li>
<li>Item Master </li>
<li>Reference Designator </li>
<li>Change Order </li>
<li>Forum Message </li>
</ul>
<p>Internal to the database, there are more Entity types, but they can&#39;t be used as Entities at the API level.</p>
<p><strong>Functions do not support all Entity types</strong> <br />Just because a function takes an EntityId doesn&#39;t mean the function will work with all Entity types.&#0160; For example, if you pass in a Folder.Id to GetProperites, it will fail because Vault does not support properties on Folders.&#0160; <br />So there is some burden on the programmer to know which functions work on which Entity types.&#0160; Knowledge of the Vault product itself should be sufficient to deduce this information.</p>
<p><strong>Entity IDs are unique across a given Vault</strong> <br />All Entity ID values are taken from the same numbering system.&#0160; For example, if you have a Folder with an ID of 5, there will be no Files with an ID of 5 for the Vault.</p>
<p><strong>API terms</strong> <br /><strong>EntityId</strong> - This is the ID value of the Entity.&#0160; Usually this is the &#39;Id&#39; property on the object.&#0160; If there are multiple Entities in the object, then pass in the one that relates to a specific version (ex.&#0160; File.Id or Folder.Id)   <br /><strong>EntityMasterId</strong> - This is the ID value that matches to the master concept, which refers to all versions of the object (ex.&#0160; File.MasterId).&#0160; If the object isn&#39;t a type that is versioned, just pass in the regular &#39;Id&#39; property (ex. Folder.Id).   <br /><strong>EntityClassId</strong> - This is a string value that tells what type of object to work with.&#0160; Some functions require this information and some do not.&#0160; Call AdminService.GetServerConfiguration() to see the list of legal values.&#0160; <br />NOTE:&#0160; Folder is noticeably absent from the list.&#0160; The reason is that there are are no functions that require an EntityClassId of &quot;FOLDER&quot;.</p>

<p><img src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/TipsAndTricks2.png" /> </p> <p>Welcome back to my <em>Storing Custom Data</em> series, where I go into the various ways you can store custom data needed by your Vault customization.&#0160; Last time I talked about using the <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2010/04/storing-custom-data-vault-options.html">Vault Options</a> concept to store your data.&#0160; </p> <p><strong>Job Server:</strong>   <br />In this article, I&#39;ll be focusing on the Job Processor API, which allows you to hook to the Jobserver feature.&#0160; If you are writing a custom job handler, you might want it to remember some settings.&#0160; Although Vault Options can be used, I want to explore something that doesn&#39;t involve additional Vault API calls.</p> <p>It&#39;s possible to have the job handler store all the data itself, with a local settings file for example.&#0160; The theory is that the job handler &quot;owns&quot; the data.&#0160; Any edits to the data, must go through the custom job handler.&#0160; From the client&#39;s point of view, the data maintenance tasks are a black box.&#0160; Any outside changes to this data would have do be done through a custom job.</p> <p><strong>Example:</strong>   <br /><a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2010/05/watch-folder.html">Watch Folder</a> has an example of this technique.&#0160; Most of the work in that utility is done by a custom job handler.&#0160; That handler also keeps track of which users are watching which folders.</p> <p>When a user says that they want to watch a folder, it causes a job to be queued.&#0160; The job informs the handler of the update to the watch settings.&#0160; The handler reads this job and updates the settings accordingly.&#0160; In this case, the settings are in an XML file local to the handler.</p> <p>When a job comes in telling the handler to scan for new files and send out emails, it does a re-read the settings file.</p> <p>HandlerClass.cs in the WatchFolderJobHandler project has the sample code.&#0160; WatchCollection.xml is the file that remembers the folders being watched for each user.&#0160; &quot;Autodesk.WatchFolder.SettingJob&quot; is the job type that tells the hander to update the settings.&#0160; &quot;Autodesk.WatchFolder.NotificationJob&quot; is the job type that tells the handler to scan for new files and send out the emails.</p> <p><strong>Analysis:</strong>   <br />This technique is probably more trouble than it&#39;s worth, but it&#39;s still worth looking into.&#0160; It&#39;s up to you to decide if this technique is best for your requirements.</p> <p>Let&#39;s list out all the issues:</p> <ul>
  <li>No easy way for a client to see the settings.&#0160; Because the job handler owns the settings, the only way to see them is talk to the job handler.&#0160; And the only way to talk to a job handler is to queue up a job.&#0160; Once the handler gets the job, some sort of mechanism needs to be developed for the job handler to pass the data back to the client (for example, an email).&#0160; Best case scenario is a few minute delay between the request and the results. </li>
  <li>Multiple handlers may be on the network at a given time.&#0160; This can result in a fragmented data set.&#0160; One way to solve this would be to put the settings in a file on a network share.&#0160; The handlers would need to handle things gracefully if they both try to write to the file at the same time.   <br />Another option is to require only one handler on the network at a time.&#0160; But there is no framework in place to enforce this configuration.</li>
  <li>Connected workgroups add problems too.&#0160; Each workgroup has its own queue, which does not get replicated to the other workgroups.&#0160; So again, it&#39;s possible to have fragmented data.&#0160; This might be OK as long as users stick to a single workgroup.&#0160; Another workaround is for the user to log-in to the workgroup with the job handler running to do the one or two things needed for that operation.&#0160; Then they can log-out and go back to their local workgroup.</li>
  <li>From a permissions standpoint, the user needs to be at least Document Editor (Level 1) to be able to add jobs to the queue.</li>

<p><img src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/TipsAndTricks2.png" /> </p> <p>If you have looked at the code for the SDK or blog samples, you probably noticed a class called ServiceManager, which acts as a factory for creating service objects.&#0160; It&#39;s very useful for things like setting the URL and security information each time a service object is created.&#0160; </p> <p>The only problem is that no two ServiceManagers are the same.&#0160; I would end up coping it from project to project.&#0160; Then I would modify it for that specific app.&#0160; For example, some apps would have GetItemService while other would now.&#0160; Some Service managers allowed multiple logins while others assumed a single login.</p> <p>So, I decided to create a single ServiceManager that could be used with any app without the need for modification.&#0160; I put in in a separate DLL called JustOnesAndZeros.WebServices.dll and added it to my <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2010/04/effective-folder-permissions-20.html">Effective Folder Permissions 2.0</a> and <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2010/05/watch-folder.html">Watch Folder</a> samples.&#0160; </p> <p>Features:</p> <ul>
  <li>A single function, GetService() works for all web services classes in the Vault API. </li>
  <li>Manages the security context for all services it creates. </li>
  <li>Recognizes VaultContext objects from the Vault Client or Job Processor APIs. </li>
  <li>Can handle multiple simultaneous logins. </li>

Could this be modified to take advantage of the SDK: Lifecycle Event Editor, instead of a scheduled task?

Also, instead of kicking off an email, what about kicking off a BAT (script file)?

Yes, you can use the Lifecycle Event Editor, but it won't pick up new files or generic check-ins.  It will only pick up lifecycle state changes.
See this post for more information:  <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2010/03/lifecycle-event-jobs.html">http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2010/03/lifecycle-event-jobs.html</a>

And yes, you can run a bat file if you want.  When handling a job, you can do anything that a .NET DLL can do.

Hi, Doug
I have an important customer that asked for this feature and It would be excellent if this plug-in could be available for 2012 versions of vault. Maybe, are you planning to upgrade it?. Any help it will be appreciated.
Thanks!!

I do plan on updating it, but there is no ETA.  This is a very crazy point in the release cycle, and these apps fall low on my priority list.

However, I posted the source code.  So feel free to update it yourself for find a programmer who can.

BODY:
<p><img src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/TipsAndTricks2.png" /> </p> <p>Autodesk.Connectivity.WebServices.dll is one of the new additions to the Vault 2011 SDK.&#0160; I wrote the DLL with one goal in mind:&#0160; The elimination of everything I hated about working with web services.</p> <p>Overall, it worked out pretty well.&#0160; (Of course, if it was a crushing failure, I wouldn&#39;t bother blogging about it.)&#0160; All SDK sample and apps from this blog are built on the DLL, so there are plenty of examples on how to use.</p><p></p> <p><strong>Summary</strong>  <br />Autodesk.Connectivity.WebServices.dll is an alternative mechanism for using the Web Services API.&#0160; Instead of creating Web References, you just create a regular DLL reference.</p> <p>I encourage you to use this DLL if possible instead of the web service approach.&#0160; Not only is it easier to use, but it&#39;s the future direction of the Web Services API.</p><p></p> <p><strong>Advantages</strong></p> <ul>
 <li><strong>WSE 3.0 issues fixed</strong>.&#0160; With web references, you have to go through extra steps to get WSE to work with Visual Studio 2008.&#0160; Use of the DLL takes care of those steps for you.&#0160; No extra steps needed. </li>
 <li><strong>All service classes are WSE enabled</strong>.&#0160; No more confusion between DocumentService and DocumentServiceWse.&#0160; There is just one class, DocumentService, and it is WSE enabled. </li>
 <li><strong>Single namespace</strong>.&#0160; If you get a File object back from a DocumentService call, it&#39;s in the same namespace as a File object from the ItemService.&#0160; No more need to copy an object from one namespace to another.  <br />The only exception is SecurityHeader.&#0160; For technical reasons, they each need to live in separate namespaces.</li>
 <li><strong>Single reference</strong>.&#0160; There are 17 web services in Vault 2011.&#0160; That&#39;s a lot of references to deal with.&#0160; True, your app will probably not use all 17, but you can expect about 3 or 4 on average.&#0160; The DLL allows you to get everything with a single reference. </li>
 </ul>
<br />
 <p><strong>Example</strong></p> <p>Here is a comparison between web references and the DLL.&#0160; The code is taken from the VaultList sample in the SDK.&#0160; You&#39;ll notice that the two pieces of code are almost identical, and that&#39;s kind of the point.&#0160; The API is the same, it&#39;s just been made easier to use.</p> <p>Using web references:</p> <table border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" width="450"><tbody>  <tr>  <td valign="top" width="450">   <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;

 <li>This DLL will works with all Vault 2011 products.&#0160; However some of the services will only work with a specific product.&#0160; So the burden is on the programmer to use only the API pieces that fit the target Vault product.&#0160; <br />For example, if you are developing an app for Vault Workgroup, don&#39;t reference the Item Service. </li>
 <li>There are two cases where different classes have the same name.&#0160; The result is a single class in the DLL with properties merged in from both cases.&#0160; This shouldn&#39;t affect how your program runs, but it might be a bit confusing when you are writing code.  <br />Here are the two cases:  <ul>
  <li>ItemService.Attmt and PackageService.Attmt </li>
  <li>DocumentServiceExtensions.LfCycDef and (ItemService or ChangeOrderService).LfCycDef </li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li>You can&#39;t use partial classes with a class in another DLL.&#0160; So if you are using the trick I <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2009/11/partial-classes-are-your-friends.html">documented earlier</a> with the Invoke method, that won&#39;t work the same.&#0160; The new way of doing things is to subclass the service object and overwrite the Invoke method.&#0160; </li>

If an application is built that references this DLL, how is it resolved since it resides outside of the scope of the web services path (i.e. <a href="http://<servermame>/autodeskdm)?">http://<servermame>/autodeskdm)?</a>

So, lets assume I were to built my own vault client (I know the client is customizable - this is a hypothetical example then).  On my dev machine the DLL is available.  However, I now deploy my custom client to other workstations that do not have the ADMS installed on them.  Since the DLL is outside the above path, won't that cause runtime problems for the custom app?

Immediately after posting this; I realized that the solution is most likely to just include the DLL with my custom application as part of its deployment.

Yes, you can sign the DLL if you need to.

There is a trick using SN.exe and ILDASM.exe, which are .NET tools provided by Microsoft.  You basically de-compile the DLL to IL code, then you re-compile with a key.


Example BAT file:
----------------------------
set assembly=Autodesk.Connectivity.WebServices

"C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v6.1\Bin\sn.exe" -k keyfile.snk
"C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v6.1\Bin\ILDASM.exe" %assembly%.dll /out=%assembly%.il
move %assembly%.dll %assembly%.1.dll
"C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v2.0.50727\ILASM.exe" %assembly%.il /dll /out=%assembly%.dll /key=keyfile.snk

Thanks for the DLL.  I have recently updated VB6 add-ins to .Net.  It is accessing the Vault database and I am wondering if there is a way to reference the Vault Security Info of the user if they have already logged into the Vault thru Inventor?  Currently, the add-in will request that the user sign into Vault again.

Thanks for your help.

Yes, there is a way for your Inventor plug-in to get the security header from the Vault plug-in.

Doug, thanks for the info.
  
I ended up using a simple add-in to test EDMSecurity.  It does not work in .Net 4 with Inventor 2011 64-bit.  The EDMSecurity.IsSignedIn always returns False and the Ticket reference throws and "Object reference is not set to an instance of an object".   It works in .Net 3.5 with Inventor 2011 64-bit but I am wanting to use 4.0.  Any suggestions / ideas?  Anyone I can follow up with?

Thanks.

Offhand I don't have an answer.  There are known issues between .NET 3.5 and 4.0 since they use different CLRs.  So you might want to check the Microsoft forums for similar problems.

BTW, Vault 2012 is written on .NET 3.5.

Dear Sir,
is it possible to run an Inventor Add-in from Vault?
Please, could you help me with some piece of VB code.
Thanks

From the Vault Explorer client, you can call other API's such as the Inventor Apprentice API.  However, if you want the full Inventor API you have to be a plug-in running inside Inventor.

Is that what you are asking?

<p><img src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/TipsAndTricks2.png" /> </p> <p>Everyone who writes a custom Vault Explorer command ends up with the same development environment, more or less.&#0160; So I thought I would quickly go over the setup that I use, just to have it documented somewhere.</p> <p><strong>Goal</strong>  <br />A typical development process for writing a program is 1) write code 2) build 3) debug 4) repeat.&#0160; The goal of the development environment is to make those steps as painless as possible.</p> <p><strong>The development computer</strong>  <br />There are a bunch of things you will want to have on your computer.&#0160; Item 1 is the only hard requirement, but items 2 and 3 will make your life much easier.</p> <ol>
 <li>Visual Studio </li>
 <li>The Vault client.&#0160; Base Vault doesn&#39;t have the ability to run custom commands.&#0160; So use either Workgroup, Collaboration, or Professional depending on your requirements. </li>
 <li>The Vault SDK.&#0160; If you don&#39;t have the Vault Server installed on your computer, copy the SDK over from the server machine. </li>
 </ol>
 <p>Note: I&#39;m using Visual Studio 2008 Team Edition.&#0160; I do not know if the Express Editions have all the capabilities that I am about to go over.</p> <p><strong>Visual Studio project references</strong>  <br />OK, your computer is set up.&#0160; Now you can create your Class Library project.&#0160; You will need to reference Autodesk.Connectivity.Explorer.Extensibility.dll from your Vault client&#39;s &quot;Explorer&quot; folder.&#0160; This DLL is already part of the client.&#0160; So tell Visual Studio <strong>not</strong> to copy the DLL to the output folder.  <br /><img src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2010/Debugging/vsSetting1.png" /> </p> <p>If you are making server calls, you will probably want to reference Autodesk.Connectivity.WebServices.dll from the SDK.&#0160; This DLL is not part of the client, so you want to keep the default setting of having the DLL copied to your output folder.</p> <p><strong>Creating the .vcet.config file</strong>  <br />Add a new XML file to your project and change the name to [project name].vcet.config.&#0160; You can look at the SDK documentation for more information on the XML syntax.&#0160; However there are some things I want to add.</p> <p>If you are deploying anything more than 1 DLL, you need to set AddFolderToAssemblyProbingPath to true.&#0160; In fact, you can set this to true always.&#0160; I don&#39;t see a reason for ever setting this to false.</p> <p>In the Visual Studio properties on the .vcet.config file, set the Copy to Output Directory setting to &quot;copy if newer&quot;.&#0160; This way, when you build, the config file goes with you. <br /><img src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2010/Debugging/vsSetting2.png" /> </p> <p><strong>Debug settings</strong>  <br />For debug mode, you can just set the build target to be the Extensions folder for your Vault Explorer client.&#0160; (ex. C:\Program Files (x86)\Autodesk\Vault Professional 2011\Explorer\Extensions\HelloWorld\ ).</p> <p>Next go to the Debug settings and set the Start Action to &quot;Start External Program&quot;.&#0160; Supply the path to your Vault Explorer EXE (ex. C:\Program Files (x86)\Autodesk\Vault Professional 2011\Explorer\Connectivity.VaultPro.exe ).&#0160; And set the working folder to the EXE directory. <br /><img src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2010/Debugging/vsSetting3.png" /> </p> <p><strong>Debugging</strong>  <br />You should be all set now.&#0160; When you run in debug mode, it should start up Vault Explorer and halt at any breakpoints you set in your code.  <br /><img src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2010/Debugging/breakpoint.png" /></p>

Hi Doug,

I'm trying to debug a Vault Client Addin (test) but can't get it to work. I actually can't get it to register at all. I've downloaded your 'EffectiveFolderPermissions' and made all settings as you suggested above, but the addin doesn't load (no new menu options available). So what am I missing here? 

TIA!

This is a common problem.  It's quite easy to miss something and the result is your command not showing up (no error).  

Here is a list of things to check:
- You are using the 2011 release or above
- You are using Vault Workgroup, Collaboration or Professional.  In other words, not the base version of Vault.
- You did a reset of the menus after you first deployed your DLL.
- You deployed your DLL to the correct location.  Make sure not to spell "Extensions" wrong.
- You deployed your .vcet.config file to the same location as the DLL.  
- You have correct information in the .vcet.config file.
- You provided a display name for all your CommandSite objects.

This list is probably not complete, but these are the ones I have run into.

Where do you reset your menus after deploying the DLL?  I'm trying to make some changes to your Effective Folder Permissions add-in so that I can manage group permissions as well as user permissions.  I've made a few changes to to the Util.cs, WebServiceSubclass.cs, and MainForm.cs files but left everything else the same.  The vcet.config file is exactly the same.  I've followed the instructions above and when I press the play button in visual studio vault opens up as expected and the dll and config files are in the Extensions\EffectiveFolderPermissions.  I am using Vault Professional.  Is there anywhere I can check for an error message?

I set a break point inside the OnLogOn method in the command class and the break point got hit so it seems like the code is at least getting loaded.   It looks like I'm getting the Effective Folder Permissions available as a context menu item and not in the tools menu as i had expected.  I'll investigate further.

You can do a menu reset by right-clicking on the menu bar in Vault.  Select the Customize option and a dialog will pop up that will allow you to reset the menu and toolbars.  After the reset, your custom command should show up properly.

A new function got added to the interface in Vault 2013.  In Visual Studio, run the "Implement Interface" command and it should add the new function to your code.  
All you need to do with CustomEntityHandlers() is return null.

BODY:
<p><img src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/TipsAndTricks2.png" /> </p> <p>You are writing a Vault application, and you have data that doesn&#39;t fit nicely into a Vault object.&#0160; Your data is not a File Property, or a Change Order, or a Folder, and so on.&#0160; Your data is something else, and you need to store it somewhere.</p> <p>Welcome to <em>Storing Custom Data</em>, which will be an ongoing series on this blog.&#0160; Storing your custom data is a common problem.&#0160; There are many solutions, each with their own pros and cons.&#0160; In each article in the series, I will explore a different way to persist the custom data in your Vault application.</p> <p><strong>Vault Options</strong>   <br />In this article, I will be talking about the &quot;Vault Options&quot; concept.&#0160; In a nutshell, a Vault Option is a name/value string pair that your program can read or write to.&#0160; I like to think of it as the Vault equivalent of the Windows registry.&#0160; </p> <p>There is a companion concept called a &quot;System Option&quot;.&#0160; The only difference is that a Vault Option is specific to a Vault and a System Option is valid across all Vaults in a given system.</p> <p>The maximum length for an option name is 50 characters.&#0160; However the value is limited only by the HTTP max request length (50 MB is the default value for Vault).&#0160; So you can get pretty creative here, as I will illustrate in an example below.</p> <p>Options can be set only by a user with administrative privileges.&#0160; However all users can read an option. So this technique is ideal for administrative settings, but doesn&#39;t work so well for user settings.</p> <p><strong>API functions</strong>   <br />You can only get or set options data through the Web Service API.&#0160; It&#39;s one of the few API features that doesn&#39;t map to a client UI command.&#0160; There are 4 relevant functions and they are all in the Knowledge Vault Service:&#0160; GetVaultOption, SetVaultOption, GetSystemOption and SetSystemOption.</p> <p>To create an option, you set it using a name that doesn&#39;t already exist.&#0160; The common naming convention is to use your company name as a prefix.&#0160; To delete an option, you just set the value to null.&#0160; </p> <p>Any application can read any option value, however the application needs to know the exact option name.&#0160; There is currently no way to browse options.&#0160; So if your app stores data here, it&#39;s fairly safe from tampering.&#0160; When you create an option, you need to remember the name.&#0160; It&#39;s good form to delete an option when you are done using it, but it&#39;s usually hard to tell when this time is.&#0160; As a result, several unused options may get accumulated in the Vault as time goes on, just like with the Windows registry.</p> <p><strong>Example</strong>   <br /><a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2010/04/effective-folder-permissions-20.html">Effective Folder Permissions 2.0</a> has an example of this technique.&#0160; In that application, there is a settings dialog, where the administrator can set up which folders to view in the Permissions Overview.&#0160; When the admin clicks OK, the settings are serialized as XML data and stored as a Vault option.&#0160; So all the settings are contained in a single option.&#0160; This approach works well for this application.&#0160; Not only is it easy to code, but it allows me to easily add or remove settings in the future.&#0160; </p> <p>This example is illustrated in Settings.cs from Effective Folder Permissions 2.0.&#0160; The Settings class not only stores the settings data, but it can serialize/deserialize itself to XML and save/load itself from the Vault option.</p>

Serialization is the process of converting an object into another format.  For example, converting an object to XML so it can be saved as a file.

Wikipedia has a nice page on it:  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serialization">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serialization</a>

You don't need to browse these options.  You hard-code a option name and use that name to look up the data.  So it's always a direct look-up.

Most people use their company name and product name in the option name to avoid collisions.  For example:  "Autodesk.deco.settings"

Maybe.  It depends on you are trying to do.  

When your command gets executed, an object is passed in that lets you see what is selected in the 3 major Vault Explorer panes.

In the case of the <b>preview pane</b>, you can see what is selected, but not which tab is active.  And for Uses and Where Used, you only get the label (filename) and not the ID.

It's still possible to get that information however.  In the <b>view pane</b>, you can get the selected file, along with the ID.  Next you would use that ID to find out the parent or child associated files.

I'm probably not making much sense.  It's hard to describe in this comments section.  I encourage you to play around with it a bit to see what data gets pass in to your command event handler.

I want to write a custom Job to move (copy) files from one folder to another (outside Vault), upon an event in vault.  Where can i start?
Is there any sample code to get me started, where can i find it?  Haven't written code in a long time, but need this functionality.
What can you lead me?

Just to be clear, the only event that Vault 2011 can do is queue up a job on a file lifecycle change.  Hopefully this meets your requirements.

The best place to start is with the SDK, which is installed to a folder called SDK under your Vault Server install directory.  You will want to focus on the Job Processor API, which is how you write a custom job handler.  There are also some samples in the SDK under the title JobProcessorApiSamples.

My Watch Folder example from this blog also uses the Job Processor API, but it's more dense than the SDK samples.

I'm not sure what your programming background is, but you might want to start at <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com">http://msdn.microsoft.com</a> for general programming help.

<p><strong>Update:</strong>&#0160; For Vault 2013 and higher, the recommended size for command icons is 16x16.</p>
<p>Vault 2011 gives you the ability to add commands to Vault Explorer.&#0160; You also have the option to include an icon with the command.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; I don&#39;t need to tell you how helpful icons can be in presenting your command.&#0160; But I <em>do</em> need to tell you about a few things you need to be aware of in the Vault Client API.&#0160; <img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2010/CommandIcons/icon.png" /> </p>
<p>I&#39;ll also talk a bit on how deal with icon transparency.&#0160; I&#39;ve created a grand total of 1 icon in my life, so I&#39;m not an expert or anything.&#0160; But if have less experience than I, you might want to have a quick read. <img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2010/CommandIcons/icon.png" /></p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p><strong>Icons in the Vault Client API</strong></p>
<p>Here are the basic steps in getting an icon to work with your Vault command:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create the icon file.&#0160; However the Client API does not support .ico files.&#0160; So I recommend creating a 32x32 PNG file instead. </li>
<li>Make sure that the image still looks good when scaled to 16.x16.&#0160; Since you are not dealing with an .ico file, you can&#39;t just create a 16x16 version. </li>
<li>In your Visual Studio project, create a resource (.resx) file. </li>
<li>Add your PNG file to the resource. </li>
<li>In your IExtension implementation, ResourceCollectionName should return the name of the resource with the icon in it.&#0160; For example, if your resource file is called &quot;Icons.resx&quot;, you would return &quot;Icons&quot;. </li>
<li>When creating your CommandItem object, set the IconResourceName property to the name of your icon as it shows up in the resource file.&#0160; In other words, the resource key of the image. </li>
<li>Set the ToolbarPaintStyle in your CommandItem object to either Glyph or TextAndGlyph depending on how you want it displayed.&#0160; Glyph is useful if it&#39;s just a toolbar command.&#0160; TextAndGlyph works best for menu commands. </li>
<li>Compile and run.&#0160; You should now have an icon with your command. </li>
</ol>
<p><strong><br /></strong></p>
<p><strong>Using transparency in icons<br /></strong></p>
<p>Unless your icon has a 32x32 square shape, you will probably want to use transparency.&#0160; For PNG files, this means selecting a single color and designating it as your transparent color.&#0160; At runtime, this color becomes transparent.&#0160; Not all image editors let you set a transparent color.&#0160; I don&#39;t think Microsoft Paint or Visual Studio let you do this, so you will need a better image editor. <img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2010/CommandIcons/icon.png" /> </p>
<p>When using transparency, it&#39;s important to have a clear and solid boundary between transparent and opaque pixels.&#0160; Things like blurry edges and shadows are a bad idea.&#0160; They might look good on a white background, but you get a halo effect on a different color background.&#0160; <img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2010/CommandIcons/icon.png" /> </p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Here are some examples comparing a white background with a black background (white is the transparency color).  <br />  <br /><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2010/CommandIcons/blurCompare.png" />   <br />Bad - blurred edges</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2010/CommandIcons/shadowCompare.png" />   <br />Bad - shadow</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2010/CommandIcons/goodCompare.png" />   <br />Good - image looks the same regardless of background</p>
<br />
<p>A common technique is to use something other than white as your transparent color.&#0160; Usually this is something bold and completely different than any other colors used. <img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2010/CommandIcons/icon.png" />   <br />  <br /><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2010/CommandIcons/nonWhiteBg.png" /></p>

Unfortunately, no.  The icons have to be in a resource file.  I'll log a feature request on this issue.

<p><img src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/Concepts2.png" /> </p> <p>Here are some important things you need to know about the new Vault 2011 feature that allows you to queue up a job on a lifecycle state change.</p> <p><strong>Configuring the system</strong>  <br />Obviously you need to have the Job Server enabled.&#0160; So that&#39;s the first step.&#0160; You can enable this feature in the Global admin settings. <br /> <br />The next thing you need to know is that each life cycle transition has 0 to N custom jobs associated with it.&#0160; When a file moves through a transition, a job will be added to the queue for each association.&#0160; </p> <p>To set up which jobs fire for which transitions, I suggest using the Lifecycle Event Editor, which is included in the util directory of the SDK.&#0160; You can also use the Web Service API function UpdateLifeCycleStateTransitionJobTypes in Document Service Extensions.&#0160; <br />My <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2010/03/vault-2011-sdk---video-tour.html">Vault 2011 SDK video tour</a> has a demo of the Lifecycle Event Editor.</p> <p>Keep in mind that this mechanism only applies to custom job types.&#0160; The built-in job types, property sync and DWF generate, are configured through different mechanisms.&#0160; </p> <p><strong>Common pitfalls</strong></p> <ul>
 <li><strong>Events are not handled in real time.</strong>&#0160; The job will instantly go on the queue after the file moves through the transition.&#0160; However, you don&#39;t know when the job will get processed.&#0160; If there is a large backlog, it might be hours before your handler runs. </li>
 <li><strong>Jobs are fired on a per-file basis.</strong>&#0160; For example, let&#39;s say you want to send out an email when a file gets released.&#0160; If someone Releases a 1000 part assembly, it will result in 1000 jobs on the queue.&#0160; You need to make sure that your handler doesn&#39;t send out 1000 emails.&#0160; Much better is to send out 1 email listing the 1000 files.</li>
 <li><strong>Transitions are specific to a lifecycle definition.</strong>&#0160; For example, if you set the jobs for WIP-&gt;Released in the Flexible Release Process, it will have no impact on files using the Basic Release Process. </li>
 </ul>
 <p> </p> <p><strong>Writing the job handler</strong></p> <p>Any job put on the queue this way will have two parameters.&#0160; It will have the &quot;FileId&quot; value and the &quot;LifeCyleTransitionId&quot; value.&#0160; These two pieces of information should allow your code to find out anything else it needs to.</p> <p>Again, your handler might be running hours after the file was transitioned, so you should handle cases like the file being deleted, or the File ID not pointing to the latest version.</p> <p>Other than that, things should be the same as any other job handler. See the SDK documentation for more information of the Job Processor API.</p>

Doug,
If there a way (apart from ECO workflow) to get notification about publishing new Item revisions?

There is no built in way.  But if the new revision comes from a state change, then you could write a job handler to send out the email.  Watch Folder uses a similar concept.

Hi Doug. Not sure if you still monitor comments from 5 year old threads, but this seemed relevant.

I have been migrating one of our tools that used ItemLifecycleExtension in the olden days to use the job processor.

This is one of those scenarios where now, the system might create 1000 individual jobs rather that one job with a bunch of items.

Are there any examples, patterns or other suggestions for how to queue up jobs, and perhaps execute them every 5 minutes (knowing that there's a chance you could lose them if the job server was closed)?

Thanks,
Matt

Hey Matt.  I get alerts when new comments are posted, regardless of how old the post is.

Anyway, one possible solution is to not use JobProcessor, which handles one job at a time.  I have another post describing how you can build your own service to read jobs off the queue.  This allows you to get around the limitations of JobProcessor.  <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2013/02/custom-jobs-without-job-processor.html">http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2013/02/custom-jobs-without-job-processor.html</a>

For example, your service could reserve 50 jobs at a time, process them all together, then mark the 50 jobs as complete.

It would be nice to see the trip through the CHM updated for Vault 2013.  It's very different.

I think video 1 in my webinar series goes over the 2012 CHM, which has the same basic layout as 2013 CHM.

<p><strong>Introduction</strong> <br />Communication with the Vault server takes the form of SOAP commands over HTTP.&#0160; As you may know, SOAP is XML data, and XML is text.&#0160; Does that mean the program you wrote uploads and downloads files as text data?</p>
<p>By default, the answer is yes, your program converts files to text when transferring files.&#0160; This can be a big performance problem if your program has to upload thousands of files.&#0160; The conversion to base64 eats up CPU cycles and increases the transfer size by about 30%.</p>
<p><strong>Setting up your project</strong> <br />If you want to transfer your files in binary mode, there are several steps you need to go through:</p>
<ol>
<li>Download and install Microsoft Web Service Extensions (<strong>WSE</strong>) 3.0.&#0160; You can find it on the Microsoft site.&#0160; (I&#39;d post a direct link, but they keep changing it). </li>
<li>If you are using Visual Studio 2005, select the &quot;Integrate with Visual Studio&quot; option during the install. </li>
<li>In your project, create a reference to <strong>Microsoft.Web.Services3</strong>. </li>
<li>If you are using Vault 2012 or higher, skip to step 8.&#0160; </li>
<li>Generate your web services. </li>
<li>If you are using Visual Studio 2008 there are some extra steps:  <ol>
<li>In the Solution Explorer, activate the Show All Files option. </li>
<li>Expand the web reference and locate the Reference.cs (or Reference.vb) file and open it. </li>
<li>Change the base class of the Service object from &quot;System.Web.Services.Protocols.SoapHttpClientProtocol&quot; to &quot;Microsoft.Web.Services3.WebServicesClientProtocol&quot; </li>
<li>(optional) Add Wse to the end of the class name and constructor. </li>
<li>Repeat as needed for the other web services.&#0160; However most people just fix up the Document Service.</li>
</ol> </li>
<li>In your code, use the web service classes with &quot;Wse&quot; at the end. </li>
<li>Create an app.config XML file if your project does not already have one. </li>
<li>Merge in the following XML:  <br /><span style="color: #800000;">&lt;configuration&gt;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; <br />&#0160; &lt;configSections&gt;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; <br />&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; &lt;section name=&quot;microsoft.web.services3&quot;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; type=&quot;Microsoft.Web.Services3.Configuration.WebServicesConfiguration, Microsoft.Web.Services3, Version=3.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=31bf3856ad364e35&quot; /&gt;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; <br />&#0160; &lt;/configSections&gt;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; <br />&#0160; &lt;microsoft.web.services3&gt;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; <br />&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; &lt;messaging&gt;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; <br />&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; &lt;maxMessageLength value=&quot;51200&quot; /&gt;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; <br />&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; &lt;mtom clientMode=&quot;On&quot; /&gt; <br />&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; &lt;/messaging&gt;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; <br />&#0160; &lt;/microsoft.web.services3&gt;   <br />&lt;/configuration&gt;</span> </li>
<li>When you build your project, app.config gets renamed to [EXE name].config.&#0160; Make sure you deploy this with your application. </li>
<li>You are done. </li>
</ol>
<p><strong> <br />Testing  <br /></strong>Gee, that&#39;s a lot of steps.&#0160; If any of them are not done property, the system will automatically revert to text transfer of your files.&#0160; So how do test things to make sure that files are being transferred as binary data?</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong>&#0160; There is a tool called Fiddler which provides a better way to test than the technique below.&#0160; See <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2012/03/fiddling-with-the-vault-api.html" target="_self">this article</a> for instructions on how to test using Fiddler.</p>
<p>Here is the approach I use.&#0160; It&#39;s not very good.&#0160; If you find a better way, please let me, and everybody else, know in the comments section.<br />The basic principle is to have IIS log the bytes transferred and see if that matches the size of a file that you upload or download with your application.</p>
<ol>
<li>Open up your IIS manager on your Vault server machine.&#0160; <br />Note: I&#39;m using IIS 5. Things may be different depending on your version. </li>
<li>Select the web site running Vault. </li>
<li>Right click and select <strong>Properties</strong>. </li>
<li>Go to the <strong>Web Site</strong> tab. </li>
<li>Check the <strong>Enable Logging</strong> box.  <br /><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2010/FileTransferBinary/IIS1.png" /> </li>
<li>Click on the <strong>Properties</strong> button. </li>
<li>Go to the <strong>Extended Properties</strong> tab. </li>
<li>Check the <strong>Extended Properties</strong> box. </li>
<li>Check the <strong>Bytes Sent</strong> and <strong>Bytes Received</strong> boxes.  <br /><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2010/FileTransferBinary/IIS2.png" /> </li>
<li>Click OK on the dialogs. </li>
<li>Find a file that is at least 10 MB large. </li>
<li>Upload the file to Vault using your application.&#0160; Or add it to Vault and download it using your application. </li>
<li>Go to the IIS log and open it.&#0160; (ex.&#0160; C:\WINDOWS\system32\Logfiles\W3SVC1\ex100316.log) </li>
<li>You should see an entry to DocumentService.asmx that has a large number of bytes transferred.&#0160; For example:  <br /><span style="font-size: xx-small;">20:28:02 127.0.0.1 POST /AutodeskDM/Services/DocumentService.asmx 200 2675 <strong>14074058</strong></span> </li>
<li>If that large number is about the size of the uploaded file, then things work.&#0160; Otherwise something is not working right and you will need to double check your application.&#0160; <br />In my case, 14,074,058 is close to the size of the file I uploaded (14,068,867).&#0160; The IIS log will always be slightly higher due to HTTP and SOAP headers. </li>
</ol>
<p>If you want to deliberately break things to test the negative case, you can do this easily without even needing to re-compile.&#0160; Just edit your .config file and set the &lt;mtom&gt; clientMode setting to &quot;Off&quot;.&#0160; Upload or download the file again and check the file size in the IIS log.&#0160; It should be significantly bigger.&#0160; For example, my test showed 18,763,057 as the transfer size, which is 33% larger than the file.</p>

<p><img src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/SampleApp2.png" /> </p> <p><strong>Introduction:</strong>   <br />6 Months ago I posted a utility called <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2009/12/recycle-bin-v11.html">The Recycle Bin</a>.&#0160; So by now, it&#39;s being used by millions of people worldwide, right?&#0160; <br />Maybe not.&#0160; The real number is probably somewhere around 0 or less.&#0160; But that&#39;s not going to stop me from writing a companion utility.&#0160; I&#39;m kind of dumb that way.</p> <p><strong>Overview:</strong>   <br />Restore Recycled will restore a file that was removed via The Recycle Bin.&#0160; If you recall, when you empty The Recycle Bin the file isn&#39;t actually deleted, instead it&#39;s moved to a backup Vault.&#0160; Restore Recycled allows you to bring the file back to the original Vault. </p> <p><img src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2010/RestoreRecycled/screenshot1.png" />   <br /><em>Search the backup vault for the file you want to restore.<br /><br /></em></p> <p><img src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2010/RestoreRecycled/screenshot2.png" />&#0160; <br /><em>Restore the file and configure the appropriate settings.<br /><br /></em></p> <p><strong>Requirements:</strong>   <br />Vault Workgroup/Collaboration/Manufacturing 2010   <br />The Recycle Bin</p> <p><a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/Apps/RestoreRecycled/RestoreRecycled-1.0.1.0-bin.zip">Click here to get the application</a>  <br /><a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/Apps/RestoreRecycled/RestoreRecycled-1.0.1.0-src.zip">Click here to get the source code</a></p> <p><strong>How to use:</strong></p> <ol>
  <li>Run Restore Recycled. </li>
  <li>Provide the necessary login information.&#0160; The &quot;backup database&quot; is the Vault where we are restoring files from.&#0160; The &quot;target database&quot; is the Vault where we are restoring files to. </li>
  <li>Type in the file name of the file you want to restore.&#0160; Wildcard characters are supported.</li>
  <li>Browse the list of files to find the correct file and version you want to restore.&#0160; If the file was backed up with Recycle Bin 1.1, the version name will be encoded in the file name (ex. Blower.3.iam is really the 3rd version of Blower.iam).</li>
  <li>Click the Restore button.</li>
  <li>In the restore dialog, set the relevant information, such as the folder location and category.&#0160; If meta-data is available, the utility will pre-populate this information, but it can still be edited if needed.</li>
  <li>Click OK and wait for the operation to complete.</li>
 </ol>
 <p><strong>Important notes:</strong></p> <ul>
  <li>Restore Recycled doesn&#39;t fix up file dependencies or BOM data.&#0160; If you are restoring a CAD file, I recommend checking out and checking back in through the CAD application.&#0160; This should repair the file linkages and metadata. </li>

Sorry, I'm noting going to be updating this one.  However, the source code is available if anyone wants to update it themselves.

<p><img src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/TipsAndTricks2.png" /> </p> <p>Here on the Vault team, we like Star Trek as much as the next group of computer programmers, which partly explains how we came up with the name &quot;Cloaked&quot; for one of the File properties.&#0160; The concept is that there is a file in the Vault that the logged-in user does not have read access to.&#0160; At an API level, you can detect that the file exists, but you can&#39;t get any useful information from it.&#0160; When this happens, we refer to the file as Cloaked.</p> <p>In order for a file to be cloaked, there must be an ACL on the file and that ACL must evaluate to the current user not having read access.</p> <p>There are only 3 pieces of information you can get from a cloaked file:&#0160; The File ID, the File Master ID and the Cloaked bit.&#0160; All other properties are removed or set to useless information.</p> <p>To illustrate things further, here is a comparison of the same File object accessed by different users.&#0160; One user has read access and the other one does not.  <br /><img src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2010/cloaked.png" /> </p> <br /> <p><strong>Hidden Files</strong></p> <p>A cloaked file is very different than a hidden file.&#0160; The hidden bit is just meta-data that suggests whether a file should be visible to the user or not.&#0160; At the API level, a hidden file is exactly the same as a non-hidden file (except for the Hidden bit).&#0160; The hidden bit does not change the security settings or the functionality.&#0160; There are a few API search functions where you can choose to omit hidden files, but that&#39;s about the extent of this property. </p> <br /> <p><strong>Testing</strong></p> <p>When testing, make sure to use a non-administrator account.&#0160; Administrators always have read access, regardless of the ACL.&#0160; Therefore you will never run into a cloaked file as an administrator.&#0160; Depending on your view of things, the &quot;administrator sees all&quot; feature is either a pro or a con.  <br />Kaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhnnnnnnn!!!!!!</p> <br /> <p><strong>If you liked this article, you might also like:</strong>   <br /><a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2009/10/security.html">Security</a></p>

<p><img src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/TipsAndTricks2.png" /> </p> <p>DateTime is a simple concept as long as you don&#39;t think about it.&#0160; I guess that&#39;s true for most things, but I don&#39;t want to get too off topic here.&#0160; When it comes to DateTime mixed with thinking, some annoying questions come up.&#0160; Such as...</p> <p><em>&quot;What happens when the Vault server is in a different time zone as the client?&quot;</em></p> <p><em>&quot;How do cultural settings affect the DateTime value?&#0160; (Example:&#0160; 01/31/2010 versus&#0160; 31.01.2010)&quot;</em></p> <br /> <p>There are basically two ways that Vault handles DateTime values.&#0160; Which way is used depends on how the information is being passed to or from the server.</p> <p><strong>Mechanism 1:&#0160; DateTime objects</strong></p> <p>If you are dealing with a DateTime object, life is simple.&#0160; The object will always reflect the local time.&#0160; Things like leap year and daylight savings time are automatically taken into account.&#0160; If the client and server are in different time zones, the web services framework automatically converts things for you.</p> <p>Example:&#0160; File.CreateDate. This value will always be the time in your local time zone.&#0160; Even if somebody from another time zone created the File, you will see the CreateDate as if the File was created from your time zone.</p> <p><strong>Mechanism 2: DateTime strings</strong></p> <p>Sometimes the DateTime value needs to be passed as a string.&#0160; In this case, the web services framework will not help you.&#0160; The Vault solution is to convert to Universal Time then write out the value in a specific format. Specifically, &quot;MM/dd/yyyy HH:mm:ss&quot; is the time format.&#0160; It&#39;s OK if this format doesn&#39;t match your current culture&#39;s format.&#0160; The point is for the Vault client and server to use a common format.</p> <p>Example:&#0160; When doing a search on a DateTime value, you need to call ToUniversalTime().ToString(&quot;MM/dd/yyyy HH:mm:ss&quot;) on the DateTime object you are using.&#0160; PartialMirrorCommand.cs in the Vault Mirror sample has an example of this search. </p>

Shouldn't the read-only attribute be based on whether the user has the file checked out or not?

If Not file.CheckedOut Or (file.CheckedOut And _
    file.CkOutUserId <> moSecSvc.SecurityHeaderValue.UserId) Then

    info.Attributes = info.Attributes Or FileAttributes.[ReadOnly]
End If

Correct, if the file is checked out to you, then you do not set the read-only attribute.

Hey Doug.. 
 Took me days of agony & pain to realize it´s the same thing on check-in / upload ( unless I ended up with a stupid hack )..  Maybe elaborate a bit on this matter in a "get started section" to help us newbies on the way.. It´s a very essential Vault concept : WHY the attributes are applied & WHEN ( in the code/process ) they are applied..

Keep up the good work! This blog is a mindblowing!

Wouldn't be sufficient to check 

IF f.locked then

instead of

IF Not file.CheckedOut Or (file.CheckedOut And _
file.CkOutUserId <> moSecSvc.SecurityHeaderValue.UserId then

??

At the time the article was written File.Locked didn't do anything.  It was "reserved for future use".
In the last couple releases of Vault, I think File.Lock has been enabled, but you should test it out for yourself to be sure.

I am trying to solve a problem I am having that seems to be related to this issue during uploading.  I have an Inventor addin that updates iProperties on all the referenced documents of an assembly.  We recently upgraded to Inventor 2015 and I am updating the code to use the new Vault API VDF classes to acquire files.  I have everything ported to the new API but after checkin Vault is indicating that my local files are out of date, red dot in the Vault explorer.  I found your "Tips and Tricks" about setting the creation time of the local file to match the vault file but when I call SetCreationTime it throws an exception saying that the file is being used by another process.  This code was originally written for Inventor 2013 and I never had any problems with it until I updated it to the new API.  This code is an important part of our work flow as it takes what would be a 5 to 6 hour job and makes it 2 to 3 minutes.  Do you have any suggestions on how to resolve this problem?

Thank you

The first step is to find out what is locking the file.  I don't think it's the Vault API.  Could it be Inventor that is locking the file?

<p><strong>Overview:   <br /></strong>A utility that sets the Vault path as a file property.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/SampleApp3-1.png" /></p>
<p><strong>Introduction:</strong> <br />I&#39;ve had a few requests for this one.&#0160; Since it was a pretty cool idea and not too hard to write, I decided to go for it.&#0160; Don&#39;t ever say that I never did anything for you.</p>
<p>Under the hood, this is just a re-write of <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2010/01/vault-mirror.html">Vault Mirror</a>.&#0160; Just like with Vault Mirror, this utility can be run from the task manager.&#0160; And this utility also has 2 ways of running.&#0160; There is a &quot;quick mode&quot; that only works on new files and a &quot;slow mode&quot; that scans every file in the Vault.&#0160; The recommendation is to create a Windows scheduled task that runs every 10 minutes or so to keep things mostly in sync.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2010/FolderProperty2.png" /></p>
<p>The Folder Property is not as reliable as Vault Mirror.&#0160; Because locked files can&#39;t be edited, you will find that several files won&#39;t have the property set.&#0160; Another difference is that The Folder Property edits data, so it consumes a license while it is running.&#0160; To mitigate the impact, the utility only consumes a license during the actual file editing.&#0160; When scanning for files, no license is consumed.&#0160; Once all the edits are made, the utility frees up the license.</p>
<p>See the readme file for additional instructions and command line parameters.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>

<p><img src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/Concepts2.png" /> </p> <p>Shares is a feature that dates all the way to Vault 1 and maybe even earlier.&#0160; It&#39;s still around in Vault 2010, but mainly for legacy purposes.&#0160; If you are new to Vault, odds are you never even heard of shares.&#0160; Even though the feature isn&#39;t used often, the fact that it&#39;s there affects other parts of the system.</p> <p>This article isn&#39;t about whether shares are good or bad, and I&#39;m not going to advocate use or non-use.&#0160; I&#39;m just going to go over the purely technical details. </p> <p><strong>Concept:</strong>  <br />A share is the idea that a file can live in multiple folders equally.&#0160; The word &quot;equally&quot; is what makes things unique.&#0160; It&#39;s not like Windows where a file lives in only 1 location and you can create shortcuts.&#0160; With Vault, the file truly lives in multiple locations.&#0160; There is no shortcut, there is no primary folder, there is no folder prioritization.&#0160; The file lives in each folder equally.&#0160; A file has to live in at least one folder, but there is no upper limit.</p> <p>Likewise, a shared file is the exact same file in all locations.&#0160; The file is not copied to different folders or anything like that.&#0160; They are truly the same object.&#0160; Change anything about the file in one location, and you change it for all locations.</p> <p><strong>Effects:</strong>  <br />Here are some of the ways that shares impact other Vault features:</p> <ul>
  <li>It&#39;s harder&#0160; to get the folder that a file lives in or to &quot;jump to&quot; a file.&#0160; Even if the file lives in only 1 folder, it <em>could</em> live in multiple folders.</li>
  <li>There&#39;s no Folder property on a File object.</li>
  <li>When you delete a file you are really just deleting it from the share.&#0160; The file will still be around if it lives in other shares.&#0160; To truly delete a file, you need to delete it from every folder that it lives in.</li>
  <li>When you move a file, you are just changing the location of one of the shares.</li>
  <li>If you set security on a folder, all files in the folder get updated with the folder&#39;s security settings.&#0160; This is still true even if the file is shared.&#0160; So it&#39;s a &quot;last one wins model&quot; where the file has the security settings of the parent folder that updated security last.</li>
  <li>On a user&#39;s local folder, a shared file gets downloaded to multiple locations as separate Windows files.&#0160; However, on the Vault Server&#39;s file store, there is only 1 copy.</li>
  <li>At the API level, you can find all the file shares with GetFoldersByFileMasterId.&#0160; The Folders are not returned in any order, so don&#39;t assume any sort of prioritization.&#0160; In fact, the order my change from call to call.</li>
 </ul>

If you are not already using shares, I do not recommend starting.  The concept is supported for backward compatibility purposes only. I don't think there is any easy way to create a share in the 2010 product line.

<p><img src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/SampleApp2.png" /> </p> <p>Sometimes I want to write a program something just for the sake of doing it.&#0160; So I decided to write a simple Java client for Vault.&#0160; As you may already know, Vault communicates over HTTP using SOAP, which means you can write a client in just about any language and platform that you want.&#0160; </p> <p>The program itself is pretty basic.&#0160; It&#39;s just a Java port of the VaultList SDK sample, which just lists all the files in the Vault.</p> <p><img src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2010/VaultListJava.png" /> </p> <p><a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/Apps/VaultListJava/VaultListJava.jar">Click here to download the application</a>  <br /><a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/Apps/VaultListJava/VaultListJava-source.zip">Click here to download the source</a></p> <p><strong>What you need:   <br /></strong>Vault 2010 (any version)  <br /><a href="http://www.java.com">Java</a>  <br /><a href="http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/ws/axis/1_4">Axis 1.4</a></p> <p><strong>To run:</strong></p> <ol>

hi doug,

Great post, do you have any example of accessing vault using http post/get method? I try to get a list of available vault, I go here <a href="http://localhost/AutodeskDM/Services/KnowledgeVaultService.asmx/GetAllKnowledgeVaults">http://localhost/AutodeskDM/Services/KnowledgeVaultService.asmx/GetAllKnowledgeVaults</a>

and click invoke but it returns error

Connectivity.Core.Exceptions.CoreException: TransactionInvalidPrincipal [106] 

I also tried to use javascript post method but this is the response i get
Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 500 (Internal Server Error)

Sorry but you can't invoke Vault API functions in that way.  Our security framework prevents it from happening.

BODY:
<p><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/SampleApp2.png" /></p>
<p>Vault Mirror holds a special place in my heart.&#0160; It&#39;s the first utility I ever released publicly, and it was one of the first utilities to be featured on Autodesk Labs.&#0160; It took me only a few hours to write, and I figured it would have a short lifetime.&#0160;</p>
<p>Much to my delight, the utility is still in use today by many people, and in ways that I never imagined.&#0160; Brian Schanen has already <a href="http://mfgcommunity.autodesk.com/blogs/blog/view/5/Vault_Mirror/">blogged</a> about this, but I want to add my own technical perspective.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/Apps/VaultMirror/VaultMirror.png" /></p>
<p><strong>What is Vault Mirror?</strong> <br />It&#39;s a utility that downloads all the files from Vault for read-only purposes.&#0160; It was designed to be automated, lightweight and efficient.&#0160; It works with the base version of Vault, and it won&#39;t consume a license in the pay-for versions.</p>
<p>Vault Mirror does <strong>not</strong> create a perfect replica of a Vault.&#0160; It only downloads the latest version of the files.&#0160; Other things like items, properties, file history, security, lifecycle states etc. are not copied.</p>
<p><strong>Where can I get it?</strong> <br />It&#39;s installed with the Vault Server, but you have to dig a bit in the SDK to find it.&#0160; The folder location is <span style="color: #008080;">[ADMS dir]\SDK\VS8\CSharp\VaultMirror\bin\Release</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #008080;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Update:&#0160; In Vault 2011, the utility has been moved to a new location [ADMS dir]\SDK\util\VaultMirror</span><br /></span></p>
<p>The readme (and source code) can be found two levels higher.&#0160; Feel free to copy things to a more convenient location.</p>
<p><strong>Uses for Vault Mirror:  <br /></strong>If you found a use not mentioned in the list below, please let us know by posting it in the comments section.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A basic version of replication.</strong>&#0160; You want to push files to a remote location or an outside group so that they can consume the files in read-only mode. </li>
<li><strong>A basic form of backup.</strong>&#0160; If you use Vault for strictly document storage, this is a good way to make backups.&#0160; As an added bonus, you can quickly restore a single file that gets deleted.&#0160; </li>
<li><strong>Copying files to a new Vault.</strong>&#0160; Use Vault Mirror to get the files, then use Autoloader to add them to the new Vault. </li>
<li><strong>Sample code.</strong>&#0160; Since the Vault API has no event model, you need to use polling to detect changes.&#0160; The Vault Mirror source code has a great example of how this works.&#0160; It&#39;s the sample that I always refer people to. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Full Mirror command:</strong> <br />The full mirror command will basically synchronize your windows folders to match the Vault folder.&#0160; Be warned, this includes deleting local files/folders if it there is not a match in the Vault.&#0160;</p>
<p>The algorithm works by going through the Vault folder-by-folder and comparing the Vault files with the files on disk.&#0160; If a file exists in the Vault but not on disk, the file is downloaded.&#0160; If a file exists on disk but not in the Vault, the local file is deleted.&#0160; If a file exists on disk and in the Vault, the checksum is compared.&#0160; If the local file has a different checksum as the Vault file, the local file is overwritten.</p>
<p>In practice, this command is only used to clean up things.&#0160; It may take a long time to run depending on the size of the Vault, so this command should be run rarely if ever.</p>
<p><strong>Partial Mirror command:</strong> <br />The partial mirror command will basically download all new files.&#0160; Any new file is downloaded.&#0160; No effort is made to clean up the local folder.</p>
<p>The algorithm works by doing a file search.&#0160; Vault Mirror remembers when the last, time a command was run, so it searches all file versions created after the time of the last search.&#0160; Any matching files are downloaded.</p>
<p>Since only new files are downloaded, this is a very scalable command.&#0160; It&#39;s no problem to run this command every few minutes so that your mirror folder is mostly up-to-date.</p>
<p><strong>Similar features:</strong> <br />Since its release, Vault has added a lot of features that I thought would make Vault Mirror obsolete.&#0160; However the utility is still in use.&#0160; Maybe people don&#39;t know about the other features, maybe they like Vault Mirror better, or maybe there is some aspect of the built-in feature that makes it unusable.&#0160; Whatever the reason, I thought I should list the features that Vault Mirror &quot;competes&quot; against.&#0160; That way you can choose the utility or feature that works best for you.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Workspace Sync</strong> - With a single click you can update your workspace to match the files in Vault.&#0160; It can also be run from the command line, so it&#39;s possible to automate things just like with Vault Mirror.&#0160; But Workspace Sync comes with many more options.</li>
<li><strong>Replication</strong> - This features creates many versions of a file store.&#0160; But unlike Vault Mirror, the replicated stores can be edited.&#0160; Vault users can run check-out, rename, copy design, and so on.&#0160; Basically any operation can be done.&#0160; To the user, it works just like a regular Vault.</li>
<li><strong>DWF Publish</strong> - This feature existed since the early versions of Vault.&#0160; You can set a Vault to publish DWF files to a folder share.&#0160; Basically it&#39;s Vault Mirror, but just for DWF files.&#0160; </li>
<li><strong>Hot Backup</strong> - This feature lets you back up the Vault with out having to take Vault offline.&#0160; With this type of backup, you get everything.&#0160; File history, meta-data, items, etc.</li>
</ul>

Let me rephrase to make sure I understand:  You want to write custom code that runs during the Rename Wizard in the Vault Explorer client, right?

Sorry, it is not possible to customize existing commands.

Hi,

We can we find the exe of the vaultmirror?
Beacause in Vault 2011 we only see the proj (source code),
but no exe.

Do we still have to build in VisualStudio?
Can we download the exe ?

Thanks

It's Windows that doesn't allow you to have file paths that are too long.  The workaround is to adjust your file tree (shorter names, less sub-folders).  

Another workaround is to change your folder mappings so that the path on disk is shorter when you download from Vault Explorer.  This trick won't work for Vault Mirror since it doesn't use those folder mappings.

Go to your client or server install.  Find the SDK folder.  Run the setup.exe.  Complete the install and make not of the install folder.  Go to the SDK install folder.  Go to the util folder.  There you will find Vault Mirror for Vault 2012.

Tnahk you Doug.

I did that but now I am getting an error message when try to run Vault Mirror.
The dialog box is there just when the actual mirror is supposed to start I am getting an error message:

Error loading IExplorerUtl.
This is usually cased by the Vault Client not being installed or an DLL load error...

Can you help.
I have both Vault client and server 2012 installed on same 64 bit computer.

My plan is to keep a mirror of the vault files in a shared network drive that then replicates to dropbox..

Vault Mirror doesn't use the checksum algorithm directly anymore.  But here is a post with the original C# code.

Hello Doug,
Vault Mirror is a nice and useful tool.

We worked with it in version 2011 with them an now with version 2014.

You wrote here: "and it won't consume a license in the pay-for versions."

This was right in version 2011.
But now in Version 2014 it need a free license.
If there is no free license, ist doesnt work an in the log-file you can se an error:
System.Web.Services.Protocols.SoapException: 319
   bei VaultMirror.Command..ctor(MainForm mainForm, String username, String password, String server, String vault, Boolean useWorkingFolder, Boolean failOnError)
   bei VaultMirror.MainForm.Main()

Is that an bug or desired?

Best regards

Michael

Looking at the source code, yes Vault Mirror 2014 does consume a license when it runs.  Offhand, I don't know why this behavior was changed.

Hello, I'm having trouble getting the Task Scheduler event to run and actually do anything, is there an example BAT file or script that has been configured that I can look at? I see the values in the read-me but I'm not getting mine to jive. the tool works when manually accessed, but not via a Task scheduler/command prompt.

Thanks

You can find some examples in postings on the Vault discussion group.  For example:  <a href="http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/vault-general-discussion/batch-file-for-vault-mirror/m-p/2530627">http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/vault-general-discussion/batch-file-for-vault-mirror/m-p/2530627</a>

Hallo Doug

in the past we used this tool the export all de .dwf files to a folder.
but after a move from one server to another (Vault 2013 basic) some files where missing.
after some study we found that the files with the .dwg.dwf extension where copied but the files with the extension .DWG.dwf where not. so they seem to be case sensitive.
is this a known issue? and is there an update / solution

thanks

I'm not aware of any case sensitive issues.  Vault Mirror shouldn't care about file type.  My guess is that it's something else.  

Is Vault Mirror writing to a log file.  Is there anything in there about the files?

Are there any security restrictions?  Log into Vault Explorer using the same user that Vault Mirror uses.  Can it access all the needed files?

If you download the files through Vault Explorer, are there any issues?

<p><img src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/TipsAndTricks2.png" /> </p> <p>Client-server communication in Vault is done via HTTP connections.&#0160; This means that Vault can be set up with various HTTP features.&#0160; Some of those features may keep your client from connecting, so let&#39;s go over how to handle things when the server is on SSL or a non-standard port. </p> <p><strong>Connecting on a different port</strong></p> <p>You can change your IIS settings to use a different port than 80.&#0160; At the API level, you handle this when you set the URL on your web service object.&#0160; For example, if you are using port 2112, you would set your DocumentService.URL value to <font color="#008080">http://servername:2112/AutodeskDM/Services/DocumentService.asmx</font></p> <p>For login dialogs, Autodesk clients use the convention of adding the port to the end of the server name.&#0160; For example, &quot;servername:2112&quot;.</p> <p><strong>Connecting via SSL</strong></p> <p>If you have your server configured for SSL, you still handle things with the URL property.&#0160; In this case your, DocumentService.URL would have the value of <font color="#008080">https://servername/AutodeskDM/Services/DocumentService.asmx</font></p> <p>For login dialogs, the Autodesk convention is to have &quot;https://&quot; before the server name.&#0160; For example, &quot;https://servername&quot;.</p> <p><strong>Connecting via SSL on a different port</strong></p> <p>The default SSL port is 443.&#0160; If you are using SSL on a different port, you can just combine the rules from above.&#0160; For example:&#0160; <font color="#008080">https://servername:2112/AutodeskDM/Services/DocumentService.asmx</font></p> <p><strong>Source Code</strong></p> <p>The VaultFileBrowser sample in the SDK handles these cases.&#0160; So feel free to borrow that code.&#0160; The login dialog assumes the same server name syntax as the rest of the Autodesk clients.</p>

I don't now.  I never tried it.  It wants a valid URL, so I would assume you need either "http://" or "https"// at the beginning.

<p><img src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/Concepts2.png" /> </p> <p>So, your program encountered an error, and the Vault Server returns error 0, which means &quot;UnspecifiedSystemException&quot;.&#0160; Here is how you deal with it.</p> <p><strong>Background:</strong> <br />Error 0 is our &quot;catch all&quot; error.&#0160; It means that you did something that caused an Exception that we here at Autodesk didn&#39;t expect.&#0160; So the Exception bubbled up to the top of the stack and resulted in error 0 getting passed back to your program.&#0160; </p> <p><strong>Getting more information:</strong> <br />The best thing to do is to find the vlog file on the server.&#0160; This file logs all server errors, including the error 0 you just ran into.&#0160; You can find the vlog in your file store folder (ex. C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\Autodesk\VaultServer\FileStore).&#0160; There will be several vlog files, since a new one is created each day.&#0160; </p> <p>Open today&#39;s file and scroll down until you find your error.&#0160; I will look something like this:</p> <table border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" width="450"><tbody>  <tr>  <td valign="top" width="450">   <p><font size="1">Error: Soap Exception ( mesg-id = 633969862478903845 )    <br />Exception: UnspecifiedSystemException [0]    <br />Stacktrace: </font></p>   <p><font size="1">Exception(Inner): Could not load type &#39;Connectivity.Core.DataAccess.IEditStatusBuilder&#39; from assembly &#39;Connectivity.Platform, Version=1.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null&#39;.    <br />Stacktrace(Inner):    <br />Server stack trace:    <br />&#0160;&#0160; at Connectivity.Document.DataAccess.Files.GetLatestFilesByFolderId(Int64 folderId, Boolean includeHidden)    <br />&#0160;&#0160; at Connectivity.Document.BusinessLogic.FileBL.GetLatestFilesByFolderId(Int64 folderId, Boolean includeHidden)    <br />&#0160;&#0160; at Connectivity.Document.Services.FileService.GetLatestFilesByFolderId(Int64 folderId, Boolean includeHidden)    <br />&#0160;&#0160; at System.Runtime.Remoting.Messaging.Message.Dispatch(Object target, Boolean fExecuteInContext)    <br />&#0160;&#0160; at System.Runtime.Remoting.Messaging.StackBuilderSink.SyncProcessMessage(IMessage msg, Int32 methodPtr, Boolean fExecuteInContext) </font></p>   <p><font size="1">Exception rethrown at [0]:    <br />&#0160;&#0160; at System.Runtime.Remoting.Proxies.RealProxy.HandleReturnMessage(IMessage reqMsg, IMessage retMsg)    <br />&#0160;&#0160; at System.Runtime.Remoting.Proxies.RealProxy.PrivateInvoke(MessageData&amp; msgData, Int32 type)    <br />&#0160;&#0160; at Connectivity.Document.Services.FileService.GetLatestFilesByFolderId(Int64 folderId, Boolean includeHidden)    <br />&#0160;&#0160; at Connectivity.Web.Services.DocumentService.GetLatestFilesByFolderId(Int64 folderId, Boolean includeHidden)</font></p>  </td>  </tr> </tbody></table> <p>This is basically the stack trace of the Exception as it is seen on the server.&#0160; Sometimes you can figure out the problem from the inner exception.&#0160; For example, if it&#39;s a NullReferenceException maybe it&#39;s due to some null data you passed in.&#0160; But most of the time it will just look like useless gibberish, which brings me to my next point.</p> <p><strong>Getting in touch with us:</strong> <br />Ideally Vault Server should be passing back something back more descriptive than 0.&#0160; If you run into it, let us know.&#0160; The best places are through the Autodesk Developer Network or on the <a href="http://discussion.autodesk.com/forums/forum.jspa?forumID=101">Vault newsgroup</a>.&#0160; Make sure to tell us what you were doing and include the appropriate section from the vlog.&#0160; </p>

<p><img src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/TipsAndTricks2.png" /> </p> <p><strong>The problem:</strong>  <br />You have a file on disk and you want to find the corresponding file in the Vault.&#0160; There are several techniques you can use, but none of them are perfect.</p> <p><strong>Technique 1: Unique file names</strong>  <br />If unique file names is turned on, then you can do a search for the file name.&#0160; Use <strong>GetUniqueFileNameRequired</strong> to determine if unique file names is turned on, then use <strong>FindFilesBySearchConditions</strong> to do a search on that file name.  <br />Even if unique file names is not turned on, this is still a pretty good approach, you just need to handle the case where multiple files have the same name.</p> <p><strong>Technique 2: Map the working folder   <br /></strong>Create a map between the local folder and the Vault folder.&#0160; Then you can look up the Vault folder by its Vault path.&#0160; Use <strong>GetEnforceWorkingFolder</strong> to tell if there is an enforced working folder.&#0160; If true, use <strong>GetRequiredWorkingFolderLocation</strong> to find out what that folder is.&#0160; If false, you need to look at the client settings to find the working folder location (<a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2009/09/client-xml-files.html">see this blog post</a>).  <br />Now that you have the working folder, you can map between the local path and the Vault path.&#0160; A call to <strong>FindLatestFilesByPaths</strong> will get you the File object from the Vault.</p> <p><strong>Technique 3: Checksum</strong>  <br />Get the checksum of the local file and use that to find the Vault file.&#0160; You can find the checksum code in Checksum.cs.&#0160; Next call <strong>FindFilePathsByNameAndChecksum</strong> to locate the file and related folders.&#0160; The nice thing about this technique is that it also locates the exact version of the file.&#0160; However, if the file has been edited on disk then this technique will not work.&#0160; </p>

<p><img src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/TipsAndTricks2.png" /> </p> <p>The Property Compliance feature has some aspects that may affect your programs.</p> <p><strong>Background:  <br /></strong>Vault has a special property called Property Compliance, which tells if your file has broken any property compliance rules. This is very useful for things like life cycle state transitions, where you don’t want files to move to the Released state unless all the properties are compliant.</p> <p><strong>The problem:  <br /></strong>The Property Compliance value is calculated by the Vault server asynchronously. So if you write a program that updates some properties then immediately moves the file to Released, you will likely run into <strong>error 1092</strong> with a <strong>restriction code of 5003</strong>, which means that the properties are not compliant.</p> <p>The error is a bit misleading. The properties may be compliant, but the Vault sever hasn’t calculated the Property Compliance value yet.</p> <p><strong>How to Fix:  <br /></strong>Unfortunately there is no perfect solution. There is no API function that will force the compliance check. Here are some workarounds you can do, and you can decide which one fits best given your project requirements.</p> <p><strong>Solution #1: Halt your program until the Property Compliance value is set</strong></p> <p>If you application has UI, you can put up a wait cursor or something while waiting.</p> <p>C# code: </p> <table border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" width="450"><tbody>  <tr>  <td valign="top" width="450">   <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;

In that case you can just to the Administration dialog and edit the appropriate life cycle states so that Property Compliance is no longer a requirement of the transition. <br /><img src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2009/transitiondialog.png" /> </p> <p><strong>Solution #3: Your program is the compliance check</strong></p> <p>Your program just set the properties, so you can be sure that those values are correct. You can also query any other properties to make sure that they are right too. If anything is not correct, your program can throw an error and not proceed with the state transition. In effect, what you have is a property compliance check in your own program instead of on the server side. So you can go ahead and remove the Property Compliance checks like in solution 2.</p> <p>The drawback here is that it assumes this transition will always be going through your program. If that is what you want, you need a way to uphold this rule. I recommend creating a user specific to your application. Next set it so that the transition can only be done by the new user. Lastly you update your program so that it logs in as that user to do lifecycle transitions.</p>

<p><img src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/Concepts2.png" /> </p> <p>The way Vault handles file properties is… interesting.&#0160; There are good reasons for the way things work, but the mechanics aren&#39;t very apparent and first.&#0160; So let me take some time to go over the concept of File properties.</p> <p><strong>Properties that Live Inside the File</strong></p> <p>Let&#39;s start out with the basics.&#0160; We&#39;ll take a look at a file on disk, no involvement with Vault.&#0160; This file probably has properties inside of it.&#0160; If it&#39;s a CAD file it has things like Part Number and Author.&#0160; The arrangement of these properties may be different for different file types, but the concept is the same:&#0160; <em>name / value pairs within the file</em>.</p> <p><img src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2009/FileProperties/FileOnDisk.png" />   </p> <p><strong>Adding to Vault</strong></p> <p>Now let&#39;s add that file to Vault.&#0160; What happens on the server side is that Vault extracts the properties from the file and stores it in the database.&#0160; There are still properties inside the file, of course.&#0160; Vault stores a perfect copy of the file on its server.</p> <p><img src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2009/FileProperties/FileInVault.png" /> </p> <p>Vault doesn&#39;t deal with those properties inside the file, however.&#0160; It is much easier to work with the copies in the database.&#0160; This allows for quick retrieval and searching.&#0160; The API refers to these properties as <strong>Derived Properties</strong> because they are just copies from another source.&#0160; These types of properties cannot be edited since, again, they are meant to be a copy of the file&#39;s properties.&#0160; You need to check out the file, edit it, and check it back in in order to change this property value.</p> <p>The convention is to use the suffix (I), (A) or (*) in the display name for these types.&#0160; They stand for Inventor, AutoCAD and &quot;other&quot; respectively.</p> <p><strong>System Properties</strong></p> <p>The Vault system automatically adds another set of properties related to Vault data, such as the check-in time and who added the file to Vault.&#0160; The API refers to these types as <strong>System Properties</strong>.&#0160; Again these property values cannot be edited directly since the Vault system assigns these values.</p> <p><img src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2009/FileProperties/SystemProperties.png" />   <br />  <br />  </p> <p><strong>User Defined Properties</strong></p> <p>This type does not show up in base Vault.&#0160; All other versions have property types that allow the value to be directly edited.&#0160; These are usually called user defined properties or UDPs.&#0160; However the API calls these <strong>Custom</strong> properties.&#0160; This is the only type that allows values to be edited.&#0160; It&#39;s also the only type that allows property definitions to be added or edited or deleted.&#0160; </p> <p><img src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2009/FileProperties/UDP1.png" /> </p> <p>It&#39;s possible to map a custom property to a derived property.&#0160; There are various uses for these maps.&#0160; For example, you can assign a value to a custom property then perform a writeback operation, which creates a new version of the file with the updated property value.</p> <p><img src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2009/FileProperties/UDP2.png" />   </p> <p><strong>Moving Forward</strong></p> <p>This is just a first look at file properties.&#0160; I&#39;ll be going into more detail in future postings.&#0160; If there is something specific you want me to go over, let me know in the comments section below.</p>

I had someone that wanted something akin to tags, like what you would have on photos in a flickr, or photobucket, or on your blog posts. This way he could select several files at once, and mark them with those tags. This is something he wanted to do to older AutoCAD files, to load into the Vault.

In my Vault Manufacturing it is possible to edit "Derived Properties" - with the Button "Edit Properties" you can display the column "Author(*)", edit it and save it...
Why does this work? Shouldn´t it work?

The way it works is that, behind the scenes, Vault Explorer checks out the file, edits the property within the file, then checks in the file.

If you download the file and open it inside the CAD application, you should find that the property has been updated with the new value.  So the file itself has changed, not just a piece of Vault meta-data.

I was wondering if it is possible to display System properties (as Version) when displaying a drawing/exporting to DWG?

Generally, no, you cannot map a system property to a file property.  There are only 3 exceptions to this rule:  Revision, Lifecycle State Name and Category Name.

You might want to take a look at a good video from Brian Schanen's blog.  It describes how to set up a mapping to the Revision system property. <a href="http://mfgcommunity.autodesk.com/blogs/blog/view/5/vw_map_rev/">http://mfgcommunity.autodesk.com/blogs/blog/view/5/vw_map_rev/</a>

Hello Doug,

Can we restrict user from editing UDP of file?

If a user has edit permission on a file, then they can edit the UDP.  There is no way to grant checkin/checkout permissions while restricting property editing.

<p><img src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/TipsAndTricks2.png" /> </p> <p>Another neat aspect of our API classes is that they are all partial classes.&#0160; This means you can spread out the class definition in multiple source files.&#0160; It’s very good for auto-generated code (like with web services) because you can have code that you control in one file while the auto-generated code stays in another file.</p> <p>Again, there are many uses for this concept.&#0160; For example:</p> <ul>
 <li>You can add properties. </li>
 <li>You can add methods.&#0160; </li>
 <li>You can implement additional interfaces. </li>
 <li>You can override the Invoke method and create a single point for all your API calls to flow through. </li>
 </ul>
 <p>My last point is probably the most useful.&#0160; For a given service, all API functions flow through the Invoke method.&#0160; By overriding that method, you can have a common spot to put code.&#0160; For example, you can…</p> <ul>
 <li>Handle errors in a generic way, such as popping up a dialog. </li>
 <li>Log each API call. </li>
 <li>See how long an API call takes to complete. </li>
 <li>Put in fixes for specific errors, such as error 300. </li>
 </ul>
 <br /> <h4>Error 300</h4> <p>This is a good time to talk about error 300, because overriding the Invoke method is the only good way I know of to handle it.&#0160; Error 300 means that the authentication token is invalid.&#0160; Usually it occurs because that server changes its encryption key, which happens periodically and without warning.&#0160; In other words, <strong>error 300 can happen, without warning, at any time while your program is running</strong>.</p> <p>The best thing to do is to re-authenticate and run the command again.&#0160; Thanks to partial classes, it isn’t too hard.</p> <p>C#: </p> <table border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" width="450"><tbody>  <tr>  <td valign="top" width="450">   <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;

Hi Doug

May I ask two questions about this:

First: If I would create a partial class for your DocumentService as you show in your blog, could it be locally or would it need to be put on the server? Can it even be compiled without the server part?

Second: The server error 300: is this just referring to 2010 or was that a feature of previous versions (such as PS 2008), too?

Thanks!

- Tobias

To answer your first question: The DocumentService class doesn't exist on the server.  The class is auto-generated by Visual Studio when you create the web reference.  So this is a client change.  Nothing gets done to the server.

To answer your second question:  Yes, error 300 and the posted work around applies to PS 2008.  The 2008 release was the first to expire security headers, so this is not an issue for Vault/PS 5 and earlier.

For Vault 2010, it doesn't matter if your class is named DocumentService or DocumentServiceWse.  What is important is that the class has the WSE featured enabled.  This article explains the WSE stuff in more detail:  <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2010/03/file-transfer-as-binary-data.html">http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2010/03/file-transfer-as-binary-data.html</a>

For Vault 2011, use the Autodesk.Connectivity.WebServices.dll.  It contains only the DocumentService class which is WSE enabled.  Partial classes won't work with DLLs, so use subclasses instead.  <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2010/04/autodeskconnectivitywebservicesdll.html">http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2010/04/autodeskconnectivitywebservicesdll.html</a>

BODY:
<p><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/TipsAndTricks3.png" /></p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong>&#0160; A better version of the below code has been provied in <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2011/11/getting-the-restriction-codes.html" target="_self">another article</a>.&#0160; The new code gets both the error code and any restriction codes.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #ff5a00;" />
<h3><strong>Errors</strong></h3>
<p>You are probably reading the error code incorrectly.&#0160; I&#39;m guessing that you are getting it from the Message text of an Exception that gets thrown when you make an API call.&#0160; Although the Message usually contains the code, it&#39;s not the &quot;correct&quot; place to get it.&#0160;</p>
<p>The correct thing to do is catch the SoapException, then check the Details property, which is a bunch of XML data.&#0160; The Vault error code can be found between the &lt;sl:errorcode&gt; tags. Also, some errors will be accompanied by extra information in the form of a string array, found between the &lt;sl:param&gt; tags. Each parameter will have its own tag and &quot;pid&quot;, which is an index value starting at 1. Most errors will not have extra parameters.&#0160; See the <strong>Error Codes</strong> page in the API documentation for more information.</p>
<p>If you don&#39;t get a SoapException, it means that the error is not coming from the Vault server.&#0160; Something else is causing the error, such as a network error.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #ff5a00;" />
<h3><strong>Restrictions</strong></h3>
<p>Restrictions can be thought of as extended error information.&#0160; In the case of an Exception from the Vault server, there is one and only one error code.&#0160; Restrictions, however, can have multiple codes.&#0160; This is useful for complex operations where multiple things can fail at once, and you want to display everything to the user in a single dialog.</p>
<p>If the error code is 1092, 1387, or 1633, then you need to examine the restriction information to find out what the problem is.&#0160; For all other errors, there is no restriction information.</p>
<p>Just like with errors, you need to examine the Details XML in the Soap Exception.&#0160; The <strong>Restriction Codes</strong> page in the API documentation has more information.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #ff5a00;" />
<h3><strong>Sample Code</strong></h3>
<p>Here is the correct way to read the error code.</p>

Technically, you should use If se IsNot Nothing which is a better translation of se != null. When compiled, Not se Is Nothing is not optimized as you would expect.

Thanks for the tip.  However, I found another issue with the original code VB code, so I decided to rewrite it.  In the old code "Dim se As SoapException = e" would cause a cast exception if e wasn't a SoapException.

As you can tell, I'm more of a C# guy.

System.Web.Services.Protocols.SoapException is the full class name.

This is just returning "1387" for me - how do I find out about the restriction information?

<p>One thing you might not be aware of is that all the API classes are XML Serializable.&#0160; This means that it’s very easy to convert on object to XML text and vice versa.&#0160; </p>
<p>There many uses for this feature.&#0160; For example…</p>
<ul>
<li>It can help you in debugging.&#0160; If you have a large object with lots of data, it’s sometimes helpful to have an XML view of that object.&#0160; Have a look at this <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/Files/flex.xml.html" target="_blank">example file</a> of a LfCycDef object. 
<li>If you are logging a case with ADN, you can include serialized objects as part of your problem description. 
<li>Store information for later use.&#0160; Just keep in mind that the class might change in the next release. 
<li>Use it as a way to check if things have been changed.&#0160; For example, you&#0160;may write&#0160;a program that requires a very specific lifecycle setup.&#0160; You want your program to detect if somebody comes along and tampers with the settings.&#0160; You can easily perform that check by serializing to XML.</li>
</li></li></li></ul>
<p>Here is some sample code to go along with my last example.</p>

<p><strong>Overview:</strong> <br />&quot;Effective Folder Permissions&quot; shows a simplified view of each user’s permissions on a set of folders.</p>
<p><img src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2009/EffectiveFolderPermissions/Screenshot.png" /> </p>
<p>There is also a bonus feature which lists all the users with administrative permissions.</p>
<p><img src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2009/EffectiveFolderPermissions/Admins.png" /> </p><br />
<p><strong>Requirements:</strong> <br />Vault 2010 (all versions)</p>
<p><strong>Introduction:</strong> <br />Not only am I a programmer, but I’m an administrator of the Vault we use for internal documents.&#0160; Yes, we do use our own product.&#0160; So I decided to write a program to make things a bit easier for us admins.&#0160; It also gave me a chance to put in practice some concepts that I previously went over:&#0160; <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2009/10/security.html" target="_blank">The Vault security model</a> and <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2009/10/windows-authentication.html" target="_blank">Windows Authentication</a>.&#0160; </p>
<p>The result is a program that runs through all the factors that determine a user’s access level.&#0160; It takes into account user permissions, ACL information, the ‘Active’ status of the user and whether or not the user has access to the Vault.&#0160; All group information is taken into account as well.</p>
<p>Lastly, I provided a simple list of all the administrators.&#0160; I recommend that every admin run this check.&#0160; You never know when somebody might accidently be given admin permissions.</p>

<p><img src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/Concepts2.png" /> </p>
<p>Vault uses two different security mechanisms.&#0160; There is a system based on <strong>user permissions</strong> and a system based on <strong>access control lists</strong> (ACL).&#0160; The permissions-based security is part of the base Vault functionality, but the ACL based security is an optional feature which may or may not be available depending on the version of Vault.</p>
<p>Both security systems operate differently.&#0160; They are conceptually different, they have different API&#39;s, and they were designed to solve different problems.&#0160; There are even cases where the two mechanisms contradict each other.</p><br />
<p><strong><font size="4">Permission-Based Security</font></strong></p>
<p>Each user has a set of <strong>roles,</strong> and each role has a set of <strong>permissions</strong>.&#0160; These permissions determine what the user can do.&#0160; Also, these permissions apply globally to everything in the Vault.&#0160; For example, if a user has the “File Read” permission, then it can read any file in the Vault. <br /><img src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2009/Security/Permissions.png" /> </p>
<p>If a user has multiple roles, then&#0160;its permission set is the union of those role permissions.&#0160; So a user has the “File Read” permission as long as&#0160;it is in at least 1 role that has that permission.&#0160; The same thing applies to groups.&#0160; Groups can have roles associated with them.&#0160; These roles trickle down to the users.&#0160; For example, a user can have no permissions of it&#39;s own, but if it&#39;s part of the Administrators group, that user has administrative permissions.&#0160; Being part of a group will never take away permissions from a user;&#0160; the user can only gain extra permissions when being part of a group.&#0160; In other words, an <strong>inclusive</strong> model is used.</p><br />
<p><strong><font size="4">ACL-Based Security</font></strong></p>
<p>An ACL is a list of who can is allowed and denied access to a given object.&#0160; Each ACL contains a list of Access Control Entries (ACE).&#0160; Each ACE contains a single User or Group and the list of permissions that it has.&#0160; Vault currently has 3 types of permissions:&#0160; <strong>Read</strong>, <strong>Write</strong> and <strong>Delete</strong>.&#0160; An ACE does not need to contain all 3 permissions.&#0160; For example, it can just set Read to ALLOW (true) and not specify the Write or Delete permissions.&#0160;&#0160; <br />&#0160;<img src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2009/Security/FolderACL.png" /> </p>
<p>ACLs use an <strong>exclusive</strong> model.&#0160; If a user has access but is in a group with restricted access, then the user will also have restricted access.&#0160; This is directly opposite from the permissions-based system.</p>Here is the algorithm for determining if an ACL allows user access: <br />
<table border="2" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" width="450">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td bgcolor="#ffffcc" valign="top" width="450">A user is given access if and only if their user or parent group has an ALLOW bit and no DENY bits.</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>The ACL model adds restrictions above and beyond the User Permission model.&#0160; However, the ACL model does not replace the other model.&#0160; In order to read a file, the user still needs the File Read user permission in addition to an ALLOW read ACL permission.&#0160; </p><br />
<p><strong><font size="4">Flowchart</font></strong></p>
<p>Let’s put everything together in flowchart form:</p>
<p><img src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2009/Security/Flowchart.png" /> </p>
<p>Keep in mind this process gets run for each permission.&#0160; So it’s possible for READ to evaluate to “Access Allowed” while WRITE evaluates to “Access Denied”.</p>

Hi,

I'm am new with autodesk vault 2007 and im interested in learning about updateACL method and AccessPermis object some of the api method which can be use to create roles. I would really appreaciate it if you could post an example of how to use Admin service and security service. I would like to use the read, delete and add capability of ACL

Thanks

Vault 2007?  I don't think we ever gave a release that name.  The release before Vault 2008 was called Vault 5.  Is that the release you are talking about?

The Effective Folder Permissions sample on this blog is a good example of how to read ACL data.  I don't have a write sample, but it's pretty much the opposite of read.  
UpdateACL in the Security service is how you add, update or delete the ACL on a folder.

The only problem I encounter is that updateACL overwrite the current role it does not insert the role I created as a new role. Do you have an idea of what method i should use instead of updateACL

So the problem is that you have existing entries in the ACL that disappear when you call UpdateACL, correct?

This is the intended behavior.  If you want the existing entries to stay, you need to pass them in as part of the UpdateACL call.

hi,
i also tried to modify the security, but on a file.
the file inherits from the folder and i want to overwrite the files security.
but if i look in my file properties after i tried my function there is no change.
i use addsystemacl and setsystemacl. 
i hope this is correct, but i cant find any example how to use the functions...

Hi Doug!

I got some questions to you about Permission-Based Security:

1. Where can I read more about permissions.
2. Where can I get entire list of all Vault permissions (Permis class) with Permis.Descr and Permis.Id members and short names, that are used in SDK (AdminUserRead, VaultOptionsSet, ChangeOrderRoutingCreate, etc.) to describe methods' Required Permissions.
3. What's the better way to call AdminUserRead-required methods (like GetGroupInfoByGroupId) for non-admin users? Redirect this task to JobProcessor?

Regards, Dmitry!

1.  You might be able to find more on the online help for Vault:  <a href="http://help.autodesk.com/view/VAULT/2015/ENU/">http://help.autodesk.com/view/VAULT/2015/ENU/</a>

2. GetAllRoles and GetPermissionsByRoleId will let you construct the full list of permissions.  Both functions are in the AdminService.

3. Job processor is one way for a non-admin to run an admin operation.  But there are a lot of limitations (time delay, hard to push data to a client).
Other options include:  
- Client app impersonates an admin by creating a second login.
- Create a new web service that exposes admin data.

what is better, to reuse an ACL (by ID) per each item object or copy the ACL per each item object?

The recommended approach is to use lifecycle states or Folders to manage security.  Setting ACLs on each object can be difficult.

If you think you need to do security on an object-by-object basis then it depends on what you want.  If you everything to have the same security and you want to be able to update them all together, then sharing an ID is a good idea.  If not then, you are forced to have a different ACL ID for each object.

<p><strong>Do not send Windows usernames and passwords to Vault!!!</strong></p>
<p>Yes, I know the login dialog makes it look like this information is going to Vault, but that’s not how it works at the API level.&#0160; <br /><img src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2009/Login.png" /> </p>
<p>What is really going on is that the Win Auth Service is used to sign in to Vault instead of the Security Service.</p>
<p>When you sign in through the Win Auth Service, you do <strong>not</strong> pass in any usernames or passwords.&#0160; Instead you indicate that you want to use Windows credentials when making the HTTP request.&#0160; Once signed in, the security credentials can be copied over to the other web service objects, just like with the Security Service.</p>
<p>Here, have some sample code.&#0160; Note that only the Vault name is passed in to SignIn().</p>

<P><strong><img src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/SampleApp2.png" /> </strong></P>
<P><strong>Overview: <br></strong>“Import from Visio” creates a lifecycle definition in Vault based on information within a Microsoft Visio file.</P>
<P><img src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2009/ImportFromVisio/ImportUtil.png" />&nbsp; </p>

<br>
<P><strong>Requirements: <br></strong><em>Vault Workgroup 2010</em> or <em>Vault Collaboration 2010</em> or <em>Vault Manufacturing 2010 <br>Microsoft Office Visio 2007</em></p>

<br>
<P><strong>Introduction:</strong> <br>On <A href="http://mfgcommunity.autodesk.com/blogs/blog/view/5/vw_Lifecycle_youtube/" target=_blank>Brian Schanen’s blog</A>, he suggested using Visio to map out your lifecycle definition.&nbsp; Using Visio is a good idea, but once the diagram is complete, you need to set up the states and transitions by hand in Vault.&nbsp; Not any more!&nbsp; Import from Visio automates the process of creating lifecycle states.</P>
<P><A href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/Apps/ImportFromVisio/ImportFromVisio-1.0.1.0-bin.zip" target=_blank>Click here to download the application</A> <br><A href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/Apps/ImportFromVisio/ImportFromVisio-1.0.1.0-src.zip" target=_blank>Click here to download the source code</A></P>
<P><br><strong>How to use:</strong></P>
<ol>
<li>Create your Visio file.&nbsp; Use <strong>Process</strong> boxes for lifecycle states and <strong>Dynamic Connectors</strong> for state transitions.&nbsp; The dynamic connectors can have double arrows. 
<li>Save your diagram and close Visio. 
<li>Run ImportFromVisio.exe. 
<li>Log in as an administrator. 
<li>Select the .VSD file.&nbsp; Visio will automatically launch then immediately close.&nbsp; This is normal.&nbsp; <br><br><img src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2009/ImportFromVisio/screenshot.png" /> <br>
<li>Fill in the rest of the data. 
<li>Click the “Create Lifecycle Definition” button.&nbsp; You should see an “Import Completed” message after a few seconds. 
<li>Exit ImportFromVisio.exe 
<li>Log into Vault as an administrator. 
<li>Verify that your lifecycle definition exists with the proper states and transitions. 
<li>Add in other data, such as security restrictions, transition criteria and associated categories. </li>
</ol>
<br>
<P>Further information can be found in the readme.</P>
<P>Enjoy.</P>

Great idea, do you plan to managed the state's security and transition's security through this application (based on the Brian's Visio File)?

Hi Doug,

Great app. I'm interested in the other way around. To document my lifecycles. Any chance that you have this already?

I agree that documenting lifecycle states by creating a visio chart from code would be awesome.

I read Out-of-the-box Vault Collaboration ships with
(a) sample lifecycles like Simple Release, Flexible Lifecycle Definition ....
(b) Sample Visio file for graphically showing all the transitions for Flexible Lifecycle definition

I dont see these 2 in my vault (logged in as admin). Where is this located?

I'm not sure about "B".  But in Vault 2012, you can view "A" under Tools->Administration->Vault Settings.  In the Behaviors tab, select the Lifecycles button.

Files in the base category don't have lifecycles on them.  If you set a file's category to Engineering, you should be able to change the lifecycle on the file.

I have not plans at the moment to update this for Vault 2012.  

If you or someone you know can program in .NET, it should be easy to update the source code.

BODY:
<img src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/Concepts2.png"><br>
Welcome to part 2 in my 2 part series on File Associations.&nbsp; In
<a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2009/09/file-associations-part-1.html">part 1</a>, I went over the concepts in base Vault.&nbsp; In this part,
I will go over concepts added by Vault Workgroup.<br>
<br>
<b>New concepts:</b><br>
Again we have 2 concepts that are simple on their own, but become
complex when added to everything else.<br>
<br>
First we have <b>Revisions</b>, which is a way to give meaning to a
set of versions.&nbsp; For purposes of this posting, I'll be using
alpha characters for revisions and numeric characters for versions.<br>
<img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2009/FileAssociations/figure5.png" height="64" width="348"><br>
<br>
<br>
The next concept is <b>Release States</b>, which is a way of saying
that a file is completed if it is in a certain lifecycle state.&nbsp;
At the API level, there is a boolean property on LfCycState which tells
if the state is a release state or not.&nbsp; A lifecycle definition
usually has only one release state, but it is possible to have 0 or
multiple release states. For the purposes of this posting, release
states will have a darker color than the other states.<br>
<img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2009/FileAssociations/figure6.png" height="130" width="352"><br>
<br>
<br>
One final note:&nbsp; The Vault clients are set up to update files
associations only with the physical file changes.&nbsp; If it's just a
change to the Vault data (for example, changing lifecycle state) then
the new file version points to the same files that the old version did.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Example:</b><br>
Let's go over an example.&nbsp; Here we have 2 files, a parent and a
child.&nbsp; Both files have gone through revision and lifecycle
changes.&nbsp; The arrows represent direct associations between the
file versions.<br>
<img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2009/FileAssociations/figure7.png" height="181" width="305"><br>
<br>
<br>
The Vault API provides 5 ways to traverse this data.&nbsp; In all these
cases, we are starting at the Parent and asking for the entire
dependency tree.<br>
<ol>
  <li><b>Get Latest - no release bias</b><br>
    <img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2009/FileAssociations/figure8.png" height="124" width="303"><br>
This is useful for CAD engineers who want the latest version of all the
files so that they can work on them.<br>
At the API level, you call <b>GetLatestFileAssociationsByMasterIds </b>in
the Document Service and pass in 'false' for the <i>releasedBiased </i>parameter.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><b>Get Latest - release bias</b><br>
    <img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2009/FileAssociations/figure9.png" height="124" width="303"><br>
This is useful for people outside the CAD department who are not
interested in the 'work in progress' data.&nbsp; They just want to see
the latest completed product.<br>
At the API level, you call <b>GetLatestFileAssociationsByMasterIds </b>in
the Document Service and pass in 'true' for the <i>releasedBiased </i>parameter.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><b>Snapshot in Time by Version</b><br>
    <img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2009/FileAssociations/figure10.png" height="124" width="303"><br>
This is useful in cases where you don't care about revisions.&nbsp; The
result is what you would get in base Vault, you only get the direct
relationships between file versions.<br>
At the API level, you call <b>GetFileAssociationsByIds </b>in the
Document Service.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><b>Snapshot in Time by Revision - no release bias</b><br>
    <img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2009/FileAssociations/figure11.png" height="128" width="304"><br>
This gives you the latest version within a revision, regardless of the
lifecycle state.<br>
At the API level, you call <b>GetRevisionFileAssociationsByIds </b>in
the Document Service and pass in 'false' for the <i>releasedBiased </i>parameter.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><b>Snapshot in Time by Revision - release bias</b><br>
    <img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2009/FileAssociations/figure12.png" height="126" width="304"><br>
This gives you the latest release version within a revision.&nbsp; If
no release version exists, the latest one in the revision is returned.<br>
At the API level, you call <b>GetRevisionFileAssociationsByIds </b>in
the Document Service and pass in 'true' for the <i>releasedBiased </i>parameter.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
</ol>
<b>Putting it All Together:</b><br>
You should be properly confused by now.&nbsp; However there are a rule that will simplify things.&nbsp; <br>
<table border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" width="100%">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td bgcolor="#ffffcc" valign="top">Rule:&nbsp; When dealing
with revisions, think in terms of revisions.&nbsp; Don't think in terms
of versions.<br>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<br>
Behind the scenes, revisions only care about 2 versions:&nbsp; the
latest version in the revision and the latest release version in the
revision.&nbsp; Many times these 2 are the same thing.&nbsp; When
thinking in terms of revisions, you need to forget about all other
versions.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
So let's redo the dependency tree for 4 and 5, this time viewing
things in terms of revisions.<br>
<ol start="4">
  <li><b>Snapshot in Time by Revision - no release bias<br>
    </b><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2009/FileAssociations/figure13.png" height="129" width="304"><br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><b>Snapshot in Time by Revision - release bias<br>
    </b><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2009/FileAssociations/figure14.png" height="126" width="305"><br>
  </li>
</ol>
There, much better.

Thanks for the review of this part of vault.

We are just starting to plan our move into release states and revision control with Vault 2010 Collaboration.  How do we apply this information to the 40 GB of existing vault data?

I guess what I was looking for was some way to apply various lifecycle states to the 1000s of existing files in my database.  For example, we last produced an assembly at version 68, rev M.  It is now at version 103.  How do I apply the released state to version 68?  It seems that these lifecycle states were designed assuming I had an empty vault and was starting from scratch.  Is that true?

The real issue here is that you can't edit historical Vault data.  That's kind of the point of Vault.  Version 68 is 'vaulted', locked down, nobody can change it.

You do have options however.  For example, you can download version 68, check it in as version 104 and set the lifecycle and revision that way.

Again, your reseller should be able to help you out here.

Quoting 
"You do have options however. For example, you can download version 68, check it in as version 104 and set the lifecycle and revision that way."

That is not exactly true.  

I can get version 68 of an ipt from the vault. I can't get version 68 of an iam with all of its children at their respective versions.

I can do this is baseline Vault 2010.  

I am trying to find the recommended procedure get my information back out of vault. I am working with my reseller to resolve this issue.

As I mentioned in the article, there are many dependency trees for a given file.  Vault Collaboration has a revision-based view of things (examples 4 and 5).  Base Vault has a version-based view of things (example 3).

It looks like you want a version-based tree.  Those links <i>are</i> still there, but you may need to write a custom program to get that information.  As I described in example 3, you can pass version 68 of your file into <b>GetFileAssociationsByIds</b> and get all the child versions.

I was hoping to avoid learning how to program ;)  

Thanks for the help understanding the as-designed limitations of Vault 2010 and existing data.

I'm trying to get a list of parent associations using GetFileAssociationsByIds but my code is erroring out.  Can you please share some code of how to do this?

I think that the VaultFileBrowser sample in the SDK has an example of GetFileAssociationsByIds to get the children.  Getting the parents works the same way but you fill out different parameters in the function.

What error code are you getting?

Thanks Doug, that helped.  I did figure out yesterday that a nulls are the cause of my error (no associations for a particular file).  The code below (from VaultFileBrowser) appears to be complete error trapping but I have a few questions which will help me (& others) understand the structure better.  How can associationArrays.Length have a value of 0?   How can associationArrays(0).FileAssocs.Length have a value of 0?

If (Not associationArrays Is Nothing AndAlso associationArrays.Length > 0 AndAlso Not associationArrays(0).FileAssocs Is Nothing AndAlso      associationArrays(0).FileAssocs.Length > 0) Then

.NET languages allow a 0 length array.  So I check for that case in the sample code.  It might be that the Vault Server never returns a 0 length array.  I check for that case anyway just to be safe.

Welcome to part 1 in my 2 part series on file associations.&nbsp; This
post will focus only on the associations seen in the base version of
Vault.&nbsp; The next post will go over Vault Workgroup concepts like
revisions and lifecycle states.<br>
<br>
<b>Introduction:</b><br>
For base vault we have 2 concepts that are simple on their own, but
start to get complex when you mix them together.&nbsp; <br>
The first concept is <b>File Versions</b>.&nbsp; Every time you edit a
file, you get a new version. Simple.<br>
The second concept is <b>File Associations</b>. &nbsp; Files can be
linked to each other in a parent/child relationship.&nbsp; This allows
you to create dependency trees.&nbsp; Again, simple.<br>
<br>
Now let's mix the concepts together.&nbsp; A file association is
between one <b>version </b>of a file and another.&nbsp; This means
that the
dependency tree might change for each version of a file.<br>
<img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2009/FileAssociations/Figure1.png" height="235" width="404"><br>
<br>
Here is where the confusion starts.&nbsp; You have a big chunk of data
and multiple ways of traversing the data.&nbsp; The good news is that
the API has some built in tools to help you.<br>
<br>
<b>Example:</b><br>
Let's go through a simple example.&nbsp; First we upload 2 new files, A
and B.&nbsp; A is the parent of B.&nbsp; This is what things look like
in Vault:<br>
<img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2009/FileAssociations/Figure2.png" height="89" width="195"><br>
<br>
Next we will check out B and check it back in with a new file, C.&nbsp;
B is the parent of C.&nbsp; Our view now looks like this:<br>
<img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2009/FileAssociations/Figure3.png" height="129" width="388"><br>
<br>
If we start at A and want to get the entire dependency tree, base Vault
gives you 2 two types of traversals:<br>
<ul>
<li><b>Snapshot in time</b>:&nbsp; You want to view the tree exactly
as it looked when it was uploaded.&nbsp; <b>GetFileAssociationsByIds</b>
in the Document Service is the function that will give you this
view.&nbsp; If you started with file A and wanted all children, you
would get this result:<br>
<img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2009/FileAssociations/Figure2.png" height="89" width="195"><br>
<br>
</li>
<li><b>Get latest</b>:&nbsp; You want to get the most recent version
of all the files involved.&nbsp; <b>GetLatestFileAssociationsByMasterIds</b>
in the Document Service is the function that will give you this
view.&nbsp; If you started with file A and wanted all children, you
would get this result:<br>
<img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2009/FileAssociations/Figure4.png" height="135" width="257"><br>
</li>
</ul>
<br>
That's all you need to know for base Vault.&nbsp; My next post will go
over the Revision and Lifecycle concepts and how they relate to file
associations.

<ul type="disc">
<li>The working folders 
<li>Saved searches 
<li>Shortcuts 
<li>Column settings </li>
</li></li></li></ul>
<br /><strong>Finding in the Information:</strong><br />Client data is stored in a bunch of XML files.&#0160; The XML syntax is pretty straightforward.&#0160; It&#39;s getting to the files that is tricky.&#0160; The path is dependent on a lot of factors.&#0160; <br /><br />Let&#39;s go through a path:<br /><span style="COLOR: #bf5f00; FONT-FAMILY: "><span style="COLOR: #855a40; FONT-FAMILY: ">C:\Documents and Settings\<strong>[Windows user]</strong>\Application Data\Autodesk\VaultCommon\Servers\<strong>[Vault version]</strong>\<strong>[Vault server]</strong>\Vaults\<strong>[Vault Name]</strong>\Objects</span></span><br /><br /><strong>Windows User</strong> - The windows login.&#0160; If there are multiple users on a single computer, they will each get different client settings.<br /><strong>Vault Version</strong> - This one looks a bit strange, for example Vault 2010 has a value of &quot;Services_Security_1_26_2009&quot;.&#0160; It&#39;s basically a code that changes with each release.&#0160; Therefore client settings are tied to a specific Vault version.<br /><strong>Vault Server</strong> - The vault server.&#0160; So settings on one server are independent of client settings on another server.<br /><strong>Vault Name</strong> - The name of the vault.&#0160; Client settings are specific to a single Vault.<br /><br />NOTE:&#0160; In Vista the path is <span style="COLOR: #855a40; FONT-FAMILY: ">C:\Users\<strong>[Windows User]</strong>\AppData\Roaming\Autodesk\VaultCommon\Servers\<strong>[Vault version]</strong>\<strong>[Vault server]</strong>\Vaults\<strong>[Vault Name]</strong>\Objects</span> .<br />Also, AppData is a hidden folder.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Writing Client Information:</strong><br />Please don&#39;t write to these XML files.&#0160; Since the XML schema isn&#39;t published, it&#39;s likely that you will break something.

Your C# can be simplified slightly with a lambda; you also can use "using" rather than an explicit close.  I also wonder whether the Metafile should be Dispose()d too:
   private System.Drawing.Image RenderThumbnailToImage(Document.PropInst propInst, int width, int height)
   {
      // convert the property value to a byte array
      var thumbnailRaw = (byte[])propInst.Val;

      // load the data into a stream but skip the first 12 bytes
      const int bytesToSkip = 12;
      using (var stream = new MemoryStream(thumbnailRaw, bytesToSkip, thumbnailRaw.Length - bytesToSkip))
      {
         // create the Metafile object
         using (var metafile = new System.Drawing.Imaging.Metafile(stream))
         {
            // render the Metafile to an Image object and display in the picture box
            return metafile.GetThumbnailImage(width, height, () => false, IntPtr.Zero);
         }
      }
   }

I’m enjoying the articles; the File Associations – Part 1 was very nice.

The Recycle Bin</strong>

<br />Let’s start things off with a bang.&#160; Here is a fully working utility with full source code.&#160; Enjoy.

<br />

<br />

<p class="asset asset-image"><a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2009/RecycleBin/screenshot1.png"><img style="display: inline; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2009/RecycleBin/screenshot1_scaled.png" /></a> 

  <br /><font color="#808080">(click image for larger view)</font></p>

<br /><strong>Overview:</strong>

<br />The Recycle Bin prevents users from deleting files directly.&#160; Instead of using the Delete command, they can send files to the Recycle Bin state.&#160; On the weekend, a utility backs up all the files in the Recycle Bin and deletes them from the Vault.

<br />

<br /><strong>Requirements:</strong>

<br /><em>Vault Workgroup 2010 </em>or <em>Vault Collaboration 2010</em> or <em>Vault Manufacturing 2010</em>

<br />

<br /><strong>Introduction:</strong>

<br />This is what I will refer to as a “high touch” utility.&#160; What I mean by high touch is that the utility doesn’t work entirely on its own.&#160; It will only work if the Vault is configured in a special way.&#160; In this case, we need to add a Recycle Bin state to the lifecycle definition.&#160; We also need to create a specialized user.

<br />

<br /><a title="Recycle Bin Application" href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/Apps/RecycleBin/RecycleBin-1.0.1.0-bin.zip">Click here to download the application</a>

<br /><a title="Recycle Bin Source Code" href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/Apps/RecycleBin/RecycleBin-1.0.1.0-source.zip">Click here to download the source code</a> 

<br />

<br /><strong>Configuring the Vault:</strong>

<br />First let’s create a Vault to put all our backup files:

<br />

<ol>
  <li>Open the Autodesk Data Management Server Console </li>

  <li>Select the Vaults entry in the left tree </li>

  <li>Select Actions -&gt; Create from the menu </li>

  <li>Create a new Vault with the name BackupVault </li>

  <li>Exit the console </li>
</ol>
<strong>Next let’s create the specialized user:</strong> 

<ol>
  <li>Log into Vault as an administrator </li>

  <li>In the menu, select Tools -&gt; Administration </li>

  <li>Select the Users tab </li>

  <li>Click on the Users button </li>

  <li>Click on the New User button </li>

  <li>Fill in “AppRecycleBin” as the UserName, choose a password, and set the role as “Administrator”, “Document Editor (Level 2)” and “Document Manager (Level 2)”.&#160; Also, give access to the main Vault and the backup Vault.
    <br />

    <p class="asset asset-image"><img src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2009/RecycleBin/New-User_scaled.png" /> </p>
  </li>

  <li>Click OK to create the user. </li>

  <li>[Optional] Create a Group called Automations and add AppRecycleBin to that group.&#160; In the future, any other application specific logins can go in this group. </li>

  <li>Close all open windows by clicking OK. </li>
</ol>

<br />Now let’s configure the lifecycle states.&#160; For this example I will use the Flexible Release Process.

<br />

<ol>
  <li>In the menu, select Tools -&gt; Administration </li>

  <li>Select the Behaviors tab </li>

  <li>Click on the Lifecycles button </li>

  <li>Select the Flexible Release Process and click on the Edit button </li>

  <li>Click on the Add button in the Lifecycle Details section </li>

  <li>Create a new state called Recycle Bin
    <br />

    <p class="asset asset-image"><img src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2009/RecycleBin/New_Lifecycle_State.png" /> </p>
  </li>

  <li>Click OK to go back to the Lifecycle Definition dialog.&#160; You should now see the Recycle Bin state in blue </li>

  <li>Click Apply and the Recycle Bin state should turn black </li>

  <li>Click on the Recycle Bin state and select the Transitions tab
    <br />

    <p class="asset asset-image"><img src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2009/RecycleBin/lifecycle_definition 1_scaled.png" /> </p>
  </li>

  <li>Select Recycle Bin -&gt; Released then click the Edit button </li>

  <li>Select the Security tab </li>

  <li>Uncheck the No Restrictions checkbox </li>

  <li>Click the Add button and select Everyone </li>

  <li>Give Everyone the Deny permission </li>

  <li>Click OK 
    <p class="asset asset-image"><img src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2009/RecycleBin/transition_1_scaled.png" /> </p>
  </li>

  <li>Repeat steps 10-15 for states Recycle Bin -&gt; Quick-Change, Released -&gt; Recycle Bin, and Quick-Change -&gt; Recycle Bin </li>

  <li>In the Lifecycle Definition dialog, select the Security tab for the Recycle Bin state </li>

  <li>Uncheck the No State Based Security checkbox </li>

  <li>Add an entry for Everyone and set the permission to Allow Read. </li>

  <li>Add an entry for AppRecycleBin and set the permission to Allow Read, Write and Delete.
    <br />

    <p class="asset asset-image"><img src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2009/RecycleBin/lifecycle_definition_2_scaled.png" /> </p>
  </li>

  <li>Update the security on the Work In Progress and For Review states so that Everyone has a Deny Delete setting and Allow for Read and Modify.
    <br />

    <p class="asset asset-image"><img src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2009/RecycleBin/lifecycle_definition_3_scaled.png" /> </p>
  </li>

  <li>Exit all dialogs by clicking OK. </li>
</ol>
Now we have our Vault configured properly.&#160; The only way to delete a file using the Flexible Release Process is to put it in the Recycle Bin and let the Recycle Bin utility delete it.

<br />

<br />

<br /><strong>Configuring the Recycle Bin Utility:</strong>

<br />

<ol>
  <li>Download and unzip the utility </li>

  <li>Create a file called Run.bat in the same directory ast RecycleBinUtil </li>

  <li>Edit Run.bat in a text editor and write out the RecycleBinUtil command.&#160; See the readme.txt file for a description of the parameters.
    <br />Example:&#160; <font color="#990000">RecycleBinUtil -U AppRecycleBin -P pass -S novdrwxp -V Vault -BV BackupVault -L out.txt</font> </li>

  <li>[Optional] Run the bat file to make sure things work </li>

  <li>Go to the Windows Control Panel and select Scheduled Tasks </li>

  <li>Right click and select New-&gt;Scheduled Task </li>

  <li>Name the scheduled task.&#160; Ex. Empty Vault Recycle Bin </li>

  <li>Right click the task and select Properties </li>

  <li>Go to the Task tab </li>

  <li>Set the Run parameter to the Run.bat file.&#160;&#160; Set the Start In parameter to be the directory that run.bat lives in. 
    <p class="asset asset-image"><img src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2009/RecycleBin/TaskSchedule1.png" /> </p>
  </li>

  <li>Go to the Schedule tab </li>

  <li>Set the task to run once a week at 1:00 AM on Sunday, or whenever you want.
    <br />

    <p class="asset asset-image"><img src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2009/RecycleBin/TaskSchedule2.png" /> </p>
  </li>

  <li>Click OK and set login info if needed. </li>
</ol>

This is great!  What else you got?

Anything on, creating a list of files in vault that are "Released"?

What about creating PDF's of "Released" files?
I have needs for somehting like this today!

Creating a list of Released files is something you can do in Vault Explorer.  You can run the Find command and search for cases where "State" is "Released".

In the API, you can run the search with FindFilesBySearchConditions in the Document Service.  The VaultFileBrowser example in the SDK has an example of how to use this function.

Doug, could this be applied to Productstream 2009?

Unfortunately no.  The Recycle Bin utility is based on the ability to set a lifecycle state on a file.  That feature was introduced in the 2010 product line and not available in PS 2009.
