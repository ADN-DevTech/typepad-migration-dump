<p>I finally got around to uploading my <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2012/02/6-hours-of-video-on-the-vault-api.html" target="_blank">webinar recordings</a> to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDA071BEB83F2713C&amp;feature=view_all" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.&#0160; The videos have always been available as downloads from this blog, but I figured some people might like to view them on YouTube.</p>
<p>If you are not familiar with my webinar series, it’s 6 hours worth of content spread out over 5 webinars.&#0160; The 4 code examples were pulled out as separate videos, which are also available from my YouTube channel.&#0160;</p>

<p>If you are blocked from YouTube, the <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2012/02/6-hours-of-video-on-the-vault-api.html" target="_blank">videos are still available for download</a>, along with the slide decks and code samples.</p>
