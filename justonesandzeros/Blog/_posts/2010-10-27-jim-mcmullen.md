<div>My first experience with programming dealt with Turtle Graphics. From there I caught the programming bug. I actually ended up going to my junior year in college without owning a computer. Even though I took computer classes in both High School and College and did rather well in them.<br /> <br /> I spend most of my time helping out in testing of the Vault product line. Lately, I have been spending time outside of work brushing up on my programming skills. It is amazing what can happen when you dust off those brain cells. I now help out with the API team.</div>
