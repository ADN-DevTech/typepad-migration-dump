<p>AU is now over, and I’m almost fully recovered.&#0160; My limp is barely noticeable and my right eye is mostly in focus.&#0160; It will take a few more weeks for the slot-machine ringing noises to fade away, but that’s to be expected.&#0160; This is a good time to go over Vault API related topics from AU. </p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p><strong>Vault wins at Apphack     <br /></strong>Autodesk Developer Network put on an event called <a href="http://promoshq.wildfireapp.com/website/6/contests/296215" target="_blank">Apphack</a>.&#0160; The idea is that people could submit their apps, and the public votes on which one should win.&#0160; I think there were around 20 entries.&#0160; The <a href="http://promoshq.wildfireapp.com/website/6/contests/296215/prize_giving" target="_blank">winning entry</a> was a Vault App!</p>
<p>Rob Oud from CAD &amp; Company submitted Vault Project Portfolio.&#0160; It’s a Vault Browser app for Windows 8 tablet.&#0160; I was able to see a quick demo between classes, and the app looks very cool.</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p><strong>My classes were not recorded, again      <br /></strong>Every year a rumor goes around that every class will be recorded, and every year it turns out to be a lie.&#0160; I don’t think I’ve ever had an AU lecture recorded.</p>
<p>Anyway, my two classes “Programming Integrations Between Autodesk Vault and Other Systems” and “Programming Custom Objects with the Autodesk Vault API” will be converted into blog posts over the next few months.&#0160; It’s probably for the best anyway.&#0160; You can’t Google for content within a video very well.</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p><strong>Process is critical     <br /></strong>I like to attend as many Vault classes as I can.&#0160; Mainly I just sit and listen.&#0160; One common theme this year was process.&#0160; If you don’t get your processes defined properly, your Vault deployment will be a failure.&#0160; That got me to thinking what I usually think about:&#0160; Can I write any apps for this?&#0160; </p>
<p>It’s a bit of a “chicken and the egg” problem.&#0160; How can I write a Vault app that helps with Vault deployment?&#0160; Any suggestions would be welcome.</p>
