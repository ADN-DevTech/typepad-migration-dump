<p><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0120a5728249970b014e606b7064970c" title="AlanZang" src="/assets/image_5d9cc3.jpg" alt="AlanZang" hspace="8" align="left" />The reason I learned programming was to hack computer games. When I came into college, I got attracted by computer games with couple of my classmates. We spent a lot of time playing different kinds of games together. Interested in winning, I wondered how the games worked, and what can I do to hack. The proudest result I achieved is when I’d hacked a web based game to get unlimited money and skillset. Thus I became the most powerful man in that virtual world. :)</p>
<p>I got a job as programmer after graduation, developing a management system for forklift production. Not as exciting as hacking games, but still very enjoyable. 6 years ago, I joined the Autodesk Vault development team. During these years, I have seen its API becoming more and more easy to use. Even though my work now is more management focused, I still get excited to code something in my spare time.</p>
