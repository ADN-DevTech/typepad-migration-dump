<p><img src="/assets/Concepts2.png" /> </p> <p>So, your program encountered an error, and the Vault Server returns error 0, which means &quot;UnspecifiedSystemException&quot;.&#0160; Here is how you deal with it.</p> <p><strong>Background:</strong> <br />Error 0 is our &quot;catch all&quot; error.&#0160; It means that you did something that caused an Exception that we here at Autodesk didn&#39;t expect.&#0160; So the Exception bubbled up to the top of the stack and resulted in error 0 getting passed back to your program.&#0160; </p> <p><strong>Getting more information:</strong> <br />The best thing to do is to find the vlog file on the server.&#0160; This file logs all server errors, including the error 0 you just ran into.&#0160; You can find the vlog in your file store folder (ex. C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\Autodesk\VaultServer\FileStore).&#0160; There will be several vlog files, since a new one is created each day.&#0160; </p> <p>Open today&#39;s file and scroll down until you find your error.&#0160; I will look something like this:</p> <table border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" width="450"><tbody>  <tr>  <td valign="top" width="450">   <p><font size="1">Error: Soap Exception ( mesg-id = 633969862478903845 )    <br />Exception: UnspecifiedSystemException [0]    <br />Stacktrace: </font></p>   <p><font size="1">Exception(Inner): Could not load type &#39;Connectivity.Core.DataAccess.IEditStatusBuilder&#39; from assembly &#39;Connectivity.Platform, Version=1.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null&#39;.    <br />Stacktrace(Inner):    <br />Server stack trace:    <br />&#0160;&#0160; at Connectivity.Document.DataAccess.Files.GetLatestFilesByFolderId(Int64 folderId, Boolean includeHidden)    <br />&#0160;&#0160; at Connectivity.Document.BusinessLogic.FileBL.GetLatestFilesByFolderId(Int64 folderId, Boolean includeHidden)    <br />&#0160;&#0160; at Connectivity.Document.Services.FileService.GetLatestFilesByFolderId(Int64 folderId, Boolean includeHidden)    <br />&#0160;&#0160; at System.Runtime.Remoting.Messaging.Message.Dispatch(Object target, Boolean fExecuteInContext)    <br />&#0160;&#0160; at System.Runtime.Remoting.Messaging.StackBuilderSink.SyncProcessMessage(IMessage msg, Int32 methodPtr, Boolean fExecuteInContext) </font></p>   <p><font size="1">Exception rethrown at [0]:    <br />&#0160;&#0160; at System.Runtime.Remoting.Proxies.RealProxy.HandleReturnMessage(IMessage reqMsg, IMessage retMsg)    <br />&#0160;&#0160; at System.Runtime.Remoting.Proxies.RealProxy.PrivateInvoke(MessageData&amp; msgData, Int32 type)    <br />&#0160;&#0160; at Connectivity.Document.Services.FileService.GetLatestFilesByFolderId(Int64 folderId, Boolean includeHidden)    <br />&#0160;&#0160; at Connectivity.Web.Services.DocumentService.GetLatestFilesByFolderId(Int64 folderId, Boolean includeHidden)</font></p>  </td>  </tr> </tbody></table> <p>This is basically the stack trace of the Exception as it is seen on the server.&#0160; Sometimes you can figure out the problem from the inner exception.&#0160; For example, if it&#39;s a NullReferenceException maybe it&#39;s due to some null data you passed in.&#0160; But most of the time it will just look like useless gibberish, which brings me to my next point.</p> <p><strong>Getting in touch with us:</strong> <br />Ideally Vault Server should be passing back something back more descriptive than 0.&#0160; If you run into it, let us know.&#0160; The best places are through the Autodesk Developer Network or on the <a href="http://discussion.autodesk.com/forums/forum.jspa?forumID=101">Vault newsgroup</a>.&#0160; Make sure to tell us what you were doing and include the appropriate section from the vlog.&#0160; </p>
