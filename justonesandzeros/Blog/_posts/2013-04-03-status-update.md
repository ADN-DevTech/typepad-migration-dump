<p>Vault 2014 is out but only the Basic version.&#0160; I’m waiting until Vault Professional 2014 is released before I dive into the technical details of the API.&#0160; Stay tuned... or whatever the 21st century equivalent is.</p>
<p>This upcoming year, I will try a new format for my videos.&#0160; Currently most of the content is contained is a <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2012/02/6-hours-of-video-on-the-vault-api.html">6-hour block of videos</a>, which I realize is probably intimidating to some people.&#0160; The new format will favor more videos with a smaller size.&#0160; I’m hoping for around 10 minutes in length.&#0160; Each video will cover only one topic to make it more bite size.</p>
<p>I’m officially on the PLM 360 team.&#0160; In fact, I’ve been on the team since the new year.&#0160; But don’t worry, Vault API Expert isn&#39;t a title I will be parting with anytime soon. I’ll still be providing plenty of Vault content on this blog and in the development community.&#0160; You will also see a few others from the Vault team contributing to things like API support and discussion groups.</p>
<p>As to what I’m working on in PLM 360, I’ll leave it to your speculation.&#0160; As you probably know, I can’t talk about things that haven’t been released yet.</p>
