<p>In case you missed the news, we have officially launched our new PLM product.&#0160; Autodesk is now a PLM company!&#0160; It was an event so awesome that we had to add an extra day to February.</p>
<p>Here are some links that can describe things better than I:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://autode.sk/AxIihS" target="_blank">Autodesk PLM 360 Social Hub</a> </li>
<li><a href="http://autode.sk/AuvOZb" target="_blank">Autodesk PLM 360 Solution Center</a> </li>
<li><a href="http://autode.sk/yoRhri" target="_blank">Video Trailer and PLM Analyst Video Series</a> </li>
</ul>
<p>Regarding this blog.&#0160; The current plan is to stay focused only on the Vault API.&#0160; And no, I don’t know where you can get details on the PLM 360 API.</p>
