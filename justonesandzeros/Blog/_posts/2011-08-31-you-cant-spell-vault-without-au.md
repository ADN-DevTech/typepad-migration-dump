<p>Imagine being able to shoot lightning from your fingers and riding to work everyday on a flying unicorn.&#0160; That&#39;s the level of awesome we are going for each year at Autodesk University.</p>
<p>Anyway, <a href="http://au.autodesk.com/?nd=au2011_register">early sign up is available now</a> and <a href="http://au.autodesk.com/?nd=au2011_class_catalog">the class list is out</a>.&#0160; As usual, there is a ton of Vault content.&#0160; Specific to API development, I&#39;ll be teaching 3 classes.&#0160; Two are virtual, which means they are videos that you can watch at your leisure.&#0160; One is lecture, which means I&#39;ll be presenting it at the event itself.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about the classes, you can ask them on the AU site.</p>
