<p>If you haven&#39;t been to the <a href="http://wikihelp.autodesk.com/Vault/" target="_blank">Vault Wiki</a> recently, you might want to have another look.&#0160; It&#39;s recently been upgraded.&#0160; The layout is more intuitive, the search engine is much improved, and there are videos for those of you that are blocked from YouTube.</p>
<p>You may also want to check out the <a href="http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/ps/dl/item?siteID=123112&amp;id=15948799&amp;linkID=9261341" target="_blank">properties white paper</a>, which explains how properties work at the product level.&#0160; It&#39;s a nice complement to <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/sitemap.html#PropertiesVault2011" target="_blank">my articles</a> which explain properties at an API level.</p>
