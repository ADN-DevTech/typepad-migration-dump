<p>My friends over at coolOrange have come out with <a href="http://blog.coolorange.com/" target="_blank">a blog of their own</a>.&#0160; It’s still young, but there are already some good articles up there, especially if you are a PowerShell fan.&#0160; Blogs are mainly fueled by active readership.&#0160; So if you want more articles (and I know I do), then make sure to let them know.</p>
