<p>I’m a QA engineer who has been working in Vault product line since 2004, which is right after I graduated from school.&nbsp; I used to lead up the QA team to working in different areas of Vault, including CAD add-ins, server and product deployment.&nbsp;&nbsp; Meanwhile, product support and implementation are part of my job. I love reading in my spare time, and basketball is my favorite game.</p>
