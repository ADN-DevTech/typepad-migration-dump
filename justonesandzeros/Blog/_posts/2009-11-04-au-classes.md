<p>If you are going to AU, you might want to check out some of the <a href="http://mfgcommunity.autodesk.com/blogs/blog/view/5/AU_09_DM_courses/">Vault&#0160;classes being offered</a>.&#0160; Unfortunately I will not be there this year, nor will there be any Vault programming classes.</p>
<p>But do not despair.&#0160; If you want an introduction to Vault programming, there are a few recordings you may have available:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you attended AU 2008, you can log into the <a href="http://au.autodesk.com/">AU website</a> and access a recording of my class <strong>Introduction to the Autodesk Vault API</strong>.&#0160; The class number is <strong>DE115-2</strong>. 
<li>If you are an Autodesk Developer Network member, you can access a webcast for beginner Vault programmers.&#0160; The web cast is titled <strong>2008 API session webcast</strong> and can be found in the Knowledgebase section of the Vault section on <a href="http://adn.autodesk.com/adn">the ADN site</a>. </li>
</li></ul>
