<p><img src="/assets/TipsAndTricks2.png" /> </p> <p>The recommended way to test your applications with the connected workgroups feature is to use 2 computers for testing.&#0160; If you only have 1 computer you can easily fix the problem by conjuring another one with your <strong>magic wand</strong>.</p> <p>What&#39;s that you say?&#0160; You don&#39;t have a magic wand?&#0160; No problem.&#0160; Just go to your boss and ask for a new computer to be purchased from your <strong>unlimited budget</strong>.</p> <p>Oh, I see.&#0160; You have a fixed budget and would rather spend money on other things.&#0160; Fine.&#0160; I figured out how to get 2 replicated Vaults running on the same server, and I wrote how to do it in a <strong>document</strong>.</p> <p><a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2010/Connected%20Workgroups%20on%20a%20single%20server.pdf" target="_blank">Click here to download the document</a></p> <p>Keep in mind, this technique is just for development and testing purposes.&#0160; Don&#39;t use it for production Vaults.&#0160; Although I can&#39;t think of why you would ever want to.</p>
