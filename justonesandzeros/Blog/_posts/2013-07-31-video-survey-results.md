<p>Thanks to everyone who took my survey.&#0160; Here are <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2013/VideoSurvey/VideoSurvey.png" target="_blank">the results</a> if you are interested.&#0160; </p>
<p>My basic takeaway is that a long video with full content is better than a short video with less content.&#0160;&#0160; This means that there won’t be many changes to how I create my videos.&#0160; I will still focus more on showing the content and less on the video length.</p>
<p>Although there is room for improvement, my videos are providing useful information to the community.&#0160; So it’s definitely worth the effort for me to keep making them.&#0160; I’ll try to improve the videos as best I can, but I also have to be mindful of my time.&#0160; I can’t spend all day making videos, so I have to do the best I can with the time that I can find.</p>
