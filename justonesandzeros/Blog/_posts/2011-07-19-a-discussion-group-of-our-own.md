<p>We now have a <a href="http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/Autodesk-Vault-Customization/bd-p/301">discussion group</a> specifically for Vault customization topics.&#0160; I expect that it will be mainly used for API questions, which is fine.&#0160; But also feel free to post feedback, tips and tricks, sample code, utilities, and anything else related to customization.</p>
<p>See you there!</p>
