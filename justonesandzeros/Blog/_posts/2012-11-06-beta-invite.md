<p>The first Beta is out for the next release of Vault.&#0160; If you do serious Vault development, you will want to sign up.&#0160; There are some really nice features you will want to get your hands on.&#0160; There are also some architectural changes that will likely affect your code.&#0160; </p>
<p>That’s about as specific as I can get on a public site.&#0160; We can chat more about the specifics on the Beta site.</p>
<p>Here is the <a href="https://beta.autodesk.com/callout/?callid=64A62443F109402BA0FB0992A52B1E01">invite link</a> to get access.&#0160; See you on the inside.</p>
