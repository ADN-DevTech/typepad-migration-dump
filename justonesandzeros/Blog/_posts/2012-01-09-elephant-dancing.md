<p>Jim Quanci, the director of the Autodesk Developer Network, has started a new blog.&#0160; <a href="http://dances-with-elephants.typepad.com/blog/" target="_blank">Dances with Elephants</a> focuses on how small companies can leverage big companies to build their business.&#0160; I think Autodesk is one of the elephants, but I’ve never been good with allegories.&#0160; Anyway, put your dance shoes on and head on over.</p>
<p>Although most <a href="http://www.autodesk.com/blogs" target="_blank">Autodesk blogs</a> are focused on Autodesk products, there are a <a href="http://philbernstein.typepad.com/" target="_blank">few blogs</a> that <a href="http://voiceofcommunity.typepad.com/" target="_blank">barely mention</a> our products.&#0160; Basically, these blogs are just employees that feel they have useful information to share, and I think it’s very cool that Autodesk provides an outlet.</p>
<p>I think I speak for all Autodesk bloggers when I say that we blog because we like to.&#0160; There’s no corporate mandate on this content.&#0160; We are free to post whatever we want, whenever we want, and I think the results speak for themselves.&#0160; So keep on reading and we’ll keep on posting.</p>
