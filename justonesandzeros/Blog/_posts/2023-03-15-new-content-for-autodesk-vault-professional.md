<p>Hello everyone. My name is Markus Koechl.<a class="asset-img-link" href="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/.a/6a0120a5728249970b02af148d08f8200c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false" style="float: right;"><img alt="Markus Koechl" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0120a5728249970b02af148d08f8200c img-responsive" src="/assets/image_5bf9aa.jpg" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: left;" title="Markus Koechl" /></a></p>
<p>I am a&#0160; Sr. Solutions Engineer in the Autodesk EMEA Technical Sales organization. You might have seen my name in the Vault customization forum, Autodesk Knowledge Network (AKN), and AU classes or even accessed my public <a href="https://github.com/koechlm?tab=repositories" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GitHub</a> repository for Vault sample applications.</p>
<p>This blog got silent for the past few years as Doug&#39;s role changed and new content spread to other repositories. Anyway - a huge part of the stuff here is still valid; the SDK Help documentation continues linking to samples of this blog... So - there are good reasons to bring everything back to this famous spot and breathe new life into this blog. Vault customization is my passion, and I will do my best to serve with valuable contributions soon.</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Markus</p>
