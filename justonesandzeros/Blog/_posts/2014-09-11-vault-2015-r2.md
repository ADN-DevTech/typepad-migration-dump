<p>Warning: A new version of Vault has been released to Subscription Center.&#0160; For the first time in many years, the Vault team put out a full release in between the standard yearly releases.&#0160; R2 is not a service pack, which is why you need to be careful.</p>
<p>If you are installing for the first time, R2 is a good enough starting point.&#0160; But if you are already running Vault in production, you will probably want to wait until Vault 2016.&#0160; Upgrading to R2 is only for those who need the new features <strong>right now</strong>.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="/assets/installWarning.png" style="float: none; margin-left: auto; display: block; margin-right: auto;" /><em><span style="color: #666666;">You thought I was joking about the warning?&#0160; This is actual UI from the installer.</span></em></p>
<p>As usual, I’ll stick to the API-related stuff and leave it to other blogs to go over the end-user feature set.&#0160; There is a pretty good overview over at <a href="http://designandmotion.net/autodesk/vault/autodesk-vault-2015-r2-summary/" target="_blank">Design and Motion</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Vault 2015 R2 technical details:</strong> <br />Just like with any other full release, 2015 R2 has it’s own SDK with its own DLLs and web services.</p>
<ul>
<li>Version number: 20.x.x.x <br /><em>The 2015 release has 19 as the version number.</em></li>
<li>Web service URL path:&#0160; /AutodeskDM/Services/v19.1/ <br /><em>Technically it should be v20 in the path.&#0160; The important part is that it’s different than v19, which is the path to the 2015 web services.</em></li>
<li>Web service compatibility:&#0160; A 2015 R2 server is compatible with the following clients:
<ul>
<li>2015 R2</li>
<li>2015*</li>
<li>2014*</li>
<li>2013*</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>* = No compatibility for Item and Package services.&#0160; Those services are completely disabled.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Package Service disabled for R2.&#0160; Almost every function will return an error.</li>
<li>Plug-in compatibility:&#0160; As usual, plug-ins need to be re-compiled for each version.
<ul>
<li>ApiVersion attribute needs to be set to “8.0”</li>
<li>The .vcet.config files need to reference version “20.0.0.0” of any Vault SDK DLLs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Plug-ins should go in the folder “%ProgramData%\Autodesk\<strong>Vault 2015 R2</strong>\Extensions”</li>
<li>When developing for the Autodesk Exchange app store, “V2015R2” is the value to use for the SeriesMin and SeriesMax values in the package.xml.</li>
<li>Vault Office Client and the full Vault Explorer Client are binary equivalents.&#0160; Any plug-in you write will load in both clients.&#0160; There is no way for your code to detect which client it’s running in.</li>
<li>R2 uses .NET 4.5 and Visual Studio 2012 is still the recommended IDE.&#0160; No change from 2015.</li>
</ul>
