<p>The only part I don’t like about a new release is updating my sample apps.&#0160; Just like with last year, I don’t have time to update all my apps.&#0160; I’m just going to focus on the ones that are important to me.&#0160;</p>
<p>vLogic looks like a good place to start, even though I just built <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2012/01/vlogic.html" target="_blank">the 2012 version</a> a couple months ago.&#0160; It’s one of those apps that I immediately wanted to add features to right after I posted it.&#0160;</p>

<p><strong>New for Vault 2013:&#0160; </strong></p>
<p><strong>Event support - </strong>vLogic scripts now come in two flavors.&#0160; <strong>Command scripts</strong> are invoked by the user when they click on the menu command.&#0160; <strong>Event scripts</strong> are invoked automatically when actions take place.&#0160; These scripts hook right into the web service command events, so you can run scripts during a checkout, add folder, delete item, and so on.&#0160; I also put in hooks for the OnLogOn and OnLogOut event in Vault Explorer.</p>
<p>There is a naming convention to determine which .ps1 files hook to which events.&#0160; See readme for more details.&#0160; Note, the example event scripts are inactive after installation.&#0160; You need to remove the ‘_’ prefix and restart Vault Explorer for those scripts to run.</p>
<p><strong>Easier navigation</strong> - Hold down the SHIFT key when running the “Create New Command” menu item and an explorer window will open to the vLogic folder.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #013181;" />
<p><strong>vLogic Features:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>No Visual Studio required to write custom commands and event handlers. </li>
<li>No compile step. </li>
<li>No deploy step. </li>
<li>Commands can be updated without having to exit Vault Explorer. </li>
<li>Easy to share scripts or modify scripts from others. </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Requirements:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Vault Workgroup/Collaboration/Professional 2013 </li>
<li>Windows PowerShell (should already be part of your OS) </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Upgrading from vLogic 2012:</strong></p>
<p>Your old scripts need to move to the “%ProgramData%\Autodesk\<strong>Vault 2013</strong>\Extensions\vLogic\<strong>command scripts”</strong> folder.&#0160; Some API functions have changed in 2013.&#0160; See the Vault 2013 SDK documentation for a list of all changed functions.&#0160; If the parameters are wrong on an API function, it will result in a runtime error.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #013181;" />
<p><strong>To use:</strong></p>
<p>Run the install and start Vault Explorer.</p>
<p>Under the Tools menu is the vLogic menu.&#0160; This is where you can run existing scripts or create new scripts.    <br />To create a new command script, select Create New Command from the vLogic menu.&#0160; After giving your script a name, you will have to re-start Vault Explorer.&#0160; When the program re-starts, your command should show up in the vLogic menu.</p>
<p>To edit a script, hold the shift key and click on the command.&#0160; The PowerShell ISE should pop up, allowing you to edit the script while Vault Explorer is running.&#0160; When you are done with your changes, save the file in the editor.</p>

<p>To run a script, run the command from the vLogic menu.</p>
<p>To delete a script, go to %ProgramData%\Autodesk\Vault 2013\Extensions\vLogic\[script folder] and remove the .ps1 file.&#0160; You can also add commands by putting .ps1 files into the appropriate folder.</p>
