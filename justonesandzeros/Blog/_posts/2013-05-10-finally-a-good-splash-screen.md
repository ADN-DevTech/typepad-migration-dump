<p>I’ve been waiting for this for almost 9 years, and it’s finally here.&#0160; Vault has a good splash screen!</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong.&#0160; The old splash screens were not <em>bad</em>, they just didn’t fit well with the product.&#0160; Commonly the Vault screens would be very CAD related.</p>

<p>The above image would look perfect on AutoCAD or Inventor, but it just doesn’t fit Vault.&#0160; It’s not a bad image, but it doesn’t describe what the product is about.</p>

<p>Some of the early releases of Vault used “guys standing around a table” imagery.</p>

<p>This is better, but it doesn’t quite hit the mark.&#0160; Notice the lack of computers or anything hi-tech.&#0160; Some of the images even featured people staring at blueprints.&#0160; Although there is a collaboration aspect to Vault, it’s not really meant to simulate face-to-face meetings like what is being shown.</p>

<p>Vault is really about connecting and organizing CAD data, which brings us to the Vault 2014 splash screen.</p>

<p>Ahh, look at it.&#0160; A thing of beauty.&#0160; It has a nice hi-tech vibe to it and is pleasing to the eye.&#0160; So what do the interconnected balls represent?&#0160; The vault client and server components?&#0160; CAD files?&#0160; People?&#0160; Data management systems?&#0160; The answer is <strong>all of the above</strong>.&#0160; Vault does all of those things, and those things are a fitting description of Vault.&#0160; </p>
<p>Vault is a hard product to describe, so it doesn’t surprise me that it took so long to get it right.&#0160; I’m just glad it happened.&#0160; As a programmer, I usually don’t care about things like branding, but it looks like some real effort was put in to understand the products.&#0160; I’m not just talking about Vault either.&#0160; All the new Autodesk product releases are accompanied by amazing imagery.</p>
