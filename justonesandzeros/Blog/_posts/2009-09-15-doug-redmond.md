<p>I love the smell of software in the morning. I love the feel of code on my fingers. Software is in my blood, and I'm happiest when I'm coding. A bad day of coding is better than a good day of fishing.</p>
<p>Let me put it another way. If I was Neo, I would have taken the blue pill. Every time I throw a Frisbee, I'm aiming for the MCP's weak spot. Whatever the problem, the answer is always 42. If this paragraph makes no sense to you, then you and I have nothing in common.</p>
<p>I consider myself lucky in that I get to do what I love every day and get paid for it. Autodesk, and the computer industry in general, has done a good job keeping me busy on interesting projects. Through this blog I can share my love of software. If you happen to find my content useful, then that's just extra icing on the cake.</p>
