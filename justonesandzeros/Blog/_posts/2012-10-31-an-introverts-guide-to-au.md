<p>I’m pretty much what you expect from a professional programmer.&#0160; I have all 7 seasons of Star Trek: TNG on DVD.&#0160; I play computer games long into the night.&#0160; And when it comes to people, my official policy is “no thanks”.&#0160; I can write code for 8 hours solid without any problems.&#0160; But put me in a group of people and ask me to mingle, and I’m burnt out within an hour.</p>
<p>In a few weeks, I’ll be going to my 5th Autodesk University conference.&#0160; Here are some of the techniques I’ve picked up over the years to cope.&#0160; Don’t get me wrong, I love AU.&#0160; I just don’t ease through the conference like my extrovert co-workers.</p>

<p><strong>Be a Wallflower      <br /></strong>If you are a regular attendee, you can quietly slip into the background.&#0160; Attend the classes you care about, visit the exhibit hall, watch a few sales pitches, and you’re done.&#0160; Despite the crowds of people, you can remain fairly anonymous.&#0160; The only thing is to make sure that you don’t miss out on anything important.&#0160; If you have a question about something, make sure to hunt down the right people and get the answers you need.</p>
<p>For my first AU, I was able to mostly get away with this technique, but those days are over.&#0160; This year I’m presenting two lectures, co-presenting one lecture, presenting at ADN DevDays, providing support for ADN DevLab, and manning both the Vault and PLM 360 booths.&#0160; Also there are about a dozen contacts, inside and outside of Autodesk, that I need to hook up with while I’m there.&#0160; There is no way for me to slip into the background.&#0160; So, I’ve had to come up with some new techniques.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #666666;" />
<p><strong>Alcohol      <br /></strong>Just about every AU event has a generous supply of alcohol.&#0160; I find that one or two beers really takes the edge off.&#0160; Of course, you must know and respect your limits.&#0160; There is nothing more pathetic than getting bombed and making a fool of yourself at a <em>software convention</em>.&#0160; </p>
<p>I have to represent Autodesk, so my limit is pretty low.&#0160; I also make sure to balance things out with food, of which there is also a generous supply at AU.&#0160; Remember, this is a marathon.&#0160; Pacing is everything.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #666666;" />
<p><strong>Tablets and Smartphones      <br /></strong>For us introverts, mobile devices are probably the best inventions of all time.&#0160; If you are at a table full of people, you can just pull out your phone and start playing away.&#0160; You are not being <em>rude;</em> you are <em>working</em>!&#0160; Also, about half the people at the table will also be busy on devices too, so you won’t even look out of place.&#0160; These devices are turning everyone into introverts.&#0160; I guess we really will be inheriting the Earth.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #666666;" />
<p><strong>Get Enough Sleep and Food      <br /></strong>Social situations are exhausting enough, you don’t need to make it worse by being hungry or tired.&#0160; The goal here is to make everything as confortable as possible to counter-balance any social discomfort.&#0160; If I know I’m in for a busy day, I usually pay for the full breakfast at the hotel restaurant instead of the free conference breakfast.&#0160; It’s worth the money to insure that I can perform better.</p>
