<p>Update:&#0160; The survey is closed.&#0160; <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2013/03/sacred-tome-of-vault-knowledge-update.html" target="_self">Go here for <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2013/03/sacred-tome-of-vault-knowledge-update.html" target="_self">the results</a></a></p>
<p>I love hearing about all the technical Vault information that people create.&#0160; It’s sort of a hobby of mine.&#0160; There is some pretty good stuff out there.&#0160; Such as <a href="http://cadtoolbox.com/2012/11/13/azure/" target="_blank">how to set up Vault on a cloud server</a> and <a href="http://communities.autodesk.com/cis/resources/osnovy-programmirovaniya-autodesk-vault" target="_blank">a Russian class on Vault API programming</a>.&#0160; It’s all good.</p>
<p>So I thought I would compile a list of these resources - these sacred tomes of technical Vault knowledge, gathered from the farthest reaches of the internet.&#0160; If you have created or know about any of these resources, please tell me about them using this <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1UeeNAqlzb8N7jLxKoUwPPnzh8MOK2hRCEnxpq_KrWWk/viewform" target="_blank">survey link</a>.&#0160; Feel to submit multiple times.</p>
<p>The only requirements are:</p>
<ul>
<li>It has to be Vault related and useful. </li>
<li>It can’t be created by Autodesk. </li>
</ul>
<p>I’ll compile the results into an article later on this month.</p>
