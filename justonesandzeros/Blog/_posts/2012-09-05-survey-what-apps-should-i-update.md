<p>This is a pretty busy time of year for me, so I don’t have time to write a new app or make major changes to an old one.&#0160; However, I could find time to do a quick port of an old app to Vault 2013.</p>
<p>So, this month’s survey is where you get to tell me which apps you would like to see updated.&#0160; My <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/sitemap.html">sitemap</a> has links to all my apps, so you can get more information on each entry in the survey.</p>
<p>Click here to take the survey</p>
<p>UPDATE:&#0160; The survey is now closed.&#0160;<a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2012/UpdateAppSurvey/AppUpdates.png" target="_self"> Here are the results</a>.</p>
