<p>Keeping with the theme of visualizing things that are not visual by default, I present to you <strong>Show Revision Diagram</strong>.&#0160; <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/showching-tong.html">Showching Tong</a> and <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/alan-zang.html">Alan Zang</a> created this app to help illustrate the revision concept.</p>

<p><strong>Requirements:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Vault Workgroup 2012, Vault Collaboration 2012 or Vault Professional 2012</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/Apps/ShowRevisionDiagram/ShowRevisionDiagram-1.0.1.0-bin.zip">Click here to download the application</a> <br /><a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/Apps/ShowRevisionDiagram/ShowRevisionDiagram-1.0.1.0-src.zip">Click here to download the source code</a></p>
<p><strong><img alt="" src="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2011/4apps/4 apps-hr2.png" /> <br />To Use:      <br /></strong>Just download the app and run the install.&#0160; Right click-on a file and run the Show Revision Diagram command.&#0160; A dialog will pop-up showing the revision history for that file.</p>
<p>The large character represents the revision iteration. The small number to the right is the version number that represents the revision.&#0160; If the text is underlined, then the revision is currently not a released state.</p>
<p>A revision that has been re-released (most likely through a quick change processes) will display a large box with smaller boxes inside. The larger box represents the main revision. The smaller boxes show the multiple version that represent each released version of the revision.</p>
<p>An O with a bar over it represents a null revision or the absence of a revision. This is treated in the same manner as an actual revision.</p>
<p>The color of the boxes has no meaning.</p>
<p>Hover your mouse over a box to see its lifecycle state.     <br /><img alt="" src="/assets/screen2.png" /></p>
