<p>Project Thunderdome is here for Vault 2015.&#0160; It’s the same product you have come to know and love, but I’ve made a few improvements this time around.&#0160;</p>
<p>First, it’s been posted to the <a href="http://apps.exchange.autodesk.com/VLTC/en/Detail/Index?id=appstore.exchange.autodesk.com%3avault2015projectthunderdome_windows32and64%3aen" target="_blank">Vault App Store</a>.&#0160; So that’s a bit of a status upgrade from previous years.&#0160; If you are interested in the <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/Apps/Thunderdome/ProjectThunderdome-5.0.2.0-src.zip" target="_blank">source code</a>, you can still get that from this blog.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>Next, I added support for <a href="http://help.autodesk.com/view/VAULT/2015/ENU/?guid=GUID-5030830E-69F8-4A57-ABE4-D1D430C58F95" target="_blank">Vault Data Standard</a>.&#0160; Several people asked for this feature, and I was more than happy to put it in.&#0160; Data Standard provides some great customization options, and Thunderdome gives you an easy way to distribute those customizations to your other Vault users.</p>
<p>If you want more information on what Project Thunderdome is, the app store page has a description of the app.&#0160; I also have <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2012/08/project-thunderdome-2013.html" target="_blank">a video</a> from a couple years ago that goes over the basics of how to use it.</p>
<p>Enjoy.</p>
