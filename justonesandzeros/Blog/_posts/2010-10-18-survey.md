<p>My blog has been online for over a year now, so it&#39;s a good time put out <a href="http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/Q6KDFVV" target="_blank">a quick survey</a> to see how things are going.&#0160;</p>
<p>All the feedback I&#39;ve had so far has been overwhelmingly positive, but I&#39;d still like to get a bit more information about who my readers are and how the blog is used.&#0160; If you could take a minute or two to fill the survey out, I would appreciate it.</p>
