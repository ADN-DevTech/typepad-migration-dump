<p>Well, that didn’t work out very well.&#0160; A couple of weeks ago I asked for people to submit useful Vault links.&#0160; I got a total of two responses.&#0160; As promised, I will be highlighting each of these links.&#0160; I’ll also add some links of my own to round out the article.</p>

<p>As the name implies, this German blog focuses mainly Inventor.&#0160; However, there is a very good <a href="http://inventorfaq.blogspot.de/search/label/Vault">Vault section</a> with some original content.&#0160; For example, using <a href="http://inventorfaq.blogspot.de/2012/09/vault-backup-in-der-cloud-mit-dropbox.html#more">Vault with Dropbox</a> and <a href="http://inventorfaq.blogspot.de/2012/09/mittels-script-abfragen-welcher.html#more">instructions on using a script to show who is currently logged into Vault</a>.&#0160; There is also a good set of articles on <a href="http://inventorfaq.blogspot.de/search/label/PSP">Productstream Professional</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks Jürgen</p>

<p>A good blog that covers many Autodesk products including <a href="http://designandmotion.net/?s=Vault&amp;submit=Search">Vault</a> and <a href="http://designandmotion.net/?s=PLM+360&amp;submit=Search">PLM 360</a>.&#0160; Most posts are quick tips, but there are also some good article-length postings.&#0160; For example, <a href="http://designandmotion.net/autodesk/vaul-ipart-mass-override/">using Vault and iLogic to override mass properties in iParts</a> and <a href="http://designandmotion.net/autodesk/vault-single-vs-multiple-project-files-update/">using multiple Inventor libraries</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks Scott</p>

<p>I feature these guys a lot, and for good reason.&#0160; Their blog has some excellent articles on Vault programming.&#0160; Each one is filled with technial information and a generous helping of source code.&#0160; I&#39;m not going to highlight any individual articles because I literally can&#39;t decide wich ones to choose.&#0160; All the articles are worth checking out.</p>

<p>This site has the best <a href="http://ww3.cad.de/cgi-bin/ubb/forumdisplay.cgi?action=topics&amp;forum=Autodesk+Vault&amp;number=293&amp;DaysPrune=1000&amp;LastLogin=&amp;mystyle=">Vault form</a> that I have come across outside of Autodesk.&#0160; I even post there from time to time.&#0160; My only wish is that Google was better with German to English translations.&#0160; They also have a very good <a href="http://ww3.cad.de/cgi-bin/ubb/forumdisplay.cgi?action=topics&amp;forum=Autodesk+Productstream+Professional&amp;number=120&amp;DaysPrune=1000&amp;LastLogin=&amp;mystyle=">Productstream Professional forum</a>.&#0160; </p>

<p><a href="http://vault-ru.blogspot.com/">Autodesk Vault по-русски</a></p>
<p>I’m pretty sure this is the best Vault blog in Russian.&#0160; There you will find interesting articles such as <a href="http://vault-ru.blogspot.com/2013/01/revit-server-autodesk-vault.html">using Vault and Revit Server</a> and a <a href="http://vault-ru.blogspot.com/2012/07/autodesk-vault-0-1.html">history of Vault</a>.&#0160; Although the main focus is Vault, there are a lot of PLM related articles popping up.</p>
