<p>You can divide my career at Autodesk into two parts.&#0160; The part before Autodesk University and the part after.&#0160; No single event has had as much impact.&#0160; Of course, the fact that I work for Autodesk had a lot to do with it.&#0160; So individual results may vary.</p>
<p>Pre AU, I was mostly your average computer programmer.&#0160; People would give me features to code, and I would code them.&#0160; I pretty much relied on management to tell be what was important in the product and how people used the product.&#0160; I did not yet have a blog or a YouTube channel.&#0160; However, some interesting things were starting up.&#0160; Vault Mirror, my first “app,” was up on Autodesk Labs, and I was actively participating with the newly created discussion group for Vault.&#0160; But AU put those initiatives in high gear.</p>

<p>The year was 2006, and one of my tasks was managing the Vault API, so ADN invited me over to show it off for DevDays.&#0160; I decided to stay for the whole week and attend as much Vault-related content as possible.</p>
<p>The classes themselves were stuff I already knew, but the real benefit for me was after the class. People would hang around after the class to talk to the instructor.&#0160; This gave me a chance to listen and talk to people, which I don’t usually get do to as a programmer.</p>
<p>The amount of information I gained from those simple conversations was amazing.&#0160; It changed my view of the product and how people use it.&#0160; Sure, at a technical level the product is the same, but it’s not always clear how technical details come together to form a useful product.</p>
<p>Even outside the classes, I was able to have good interactions.&#0160; At lunch, I’d sit with a bunch of strangers.&#0160; After seeing from my badge that I worked at Autodesk, the conversations would pretty much go like this...</p>
<p>“So you work at Autodesk, what do you do?”</p>
<p>“I work on the Vault product.”</p>
<p>“Vault?&#0160; I think I may have heard of it.&#0160; What does it do, exactly?”</p>
<p>“Well, let me tell you...” </p>
<p>And before I knew it, I turned into a salesman. It’s not something I would want to do every day, but it was still a welcome change from day-to-day programming work.</p>

<p>The main stage event blew me away.&#0160; Before then I had no idea just how <em>cool</em> Autodesk is.&#0160; Sure the Media and Entertainment division is a big help with their 3D animation software.&#0160; But the geeky CAD stuff was just as cool to me.&#0160; Cities designed in 3D, factory floor simulations, etc.&#0160; Not many companies could pull off that kind of presentation, so I felt privileged to be part Autodesk.</p>
<p>This is probably the only part of AU that has lost it luster for me.&#0160; I still enjoy the main stage events, but they don’t pack nearly the same punch as the first one.&#0160; Although I was very happy to see Vault an PLM get some time on the main stage last year.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #666666;" />
<p>After that first AU, things changed for me.&#0160; I still spend most of my time programming, but my role expanded in ways I couldn’t comprehend.&#0160; A significant portion of my time now goes to API training and support.&#0160; Maybe those changes would have happened anyway, but AU was definitely a tipping point.</p>
<p>I’ve been back to AU four times since then, and I learn something new each time.&#0160; Most of my apps are inspired by my interactions with customers and resellers.&#0160; But there are intangible benefits too.&#0160; Every feature I code is influenced, sometimes at a sub-conscience level, by those interactions.&#0160; I can’t wait for this year’s AU.</p>
<p>See you there. </p>
