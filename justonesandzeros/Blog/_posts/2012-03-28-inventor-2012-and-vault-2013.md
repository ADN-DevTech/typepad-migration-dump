<p>If you are upgrading your server to Vault 2013, but still want to use Inventor 2012 with Vault, here are the steps you need to go through.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>:&#0160; Do nothing    <br /><strong>Step 2</strong>:&#0160; There is no step 2.&#0160; Everything should be working.</p>
<p>These steps also work with the 2012 versions of AutoCAD, Revit, AutoCAD Mechanical, AutoCAD Electrical, Civil 3D, Plant 3D, Fusion, Inventor Publisher, Navisworks, 3D Studio Max, Vault Explorer, SharePoint 2010, Vault Gadget, and so on....</p>
<p>Also, any 2011 client that has been patched to work with Vault 2012 will also work with Vault 2013.&#0160; If you have a 2010 client that has been patched to work with Vault 2012, I don’t think we provide official support for working with Vault 2013 (it should still work though).</p>
<p>This post has been brought to you by the Web Service Compatibility feature in the Vault 2013 API.&#0160; Enjoy.</p>
