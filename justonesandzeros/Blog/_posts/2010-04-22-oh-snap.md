<p><img src="/assets/Announcements2.png" /> </p> <p>There is a new utility up on Labs from the team that brought you Vault.&#0160; It&#39;s name is <a href="http://labs.autodesk.com/utilities/snap/">Snap</a> and it&#39;s an indexing service for your CAD files.&#0160; The goal is to have a single interface to use for searching CAD data.&#0160; Currently Snap runs in AutoCAD and only indexes DWG files stored in Windows folders.</p> <p><em>Wait, doesn&#39;t Vault do the same thing?</em> <br />Yes... once you add the CAD files to Vault.&#0160;&#0160; Snap is different because it runs on your local computer.&#0160; So there&#39;s no server component.&#0160; No login.&#0160; No setting up a working folder.&#0160; All you need to do is drag in the Windows folders that you want to index, and Snap will do the rest.</p> <p>There are other features too, such as the ability to create snapshots and saved searches.&#0160; Check it out <a href="http://labs.autodesk.com/utilities/snap/">on Labs</a>.&#0160; There you can find the download link and demo videos.</p> <p>Oh, and be sure to <a href="http://discussion.autodesk.com/forums/forum.jspa?forumID=408">let us know what you think</a>.&#0160; </p>
