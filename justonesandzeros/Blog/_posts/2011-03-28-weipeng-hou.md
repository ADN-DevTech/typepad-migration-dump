<p>I have been with Autodesk since 2004 as a software developer, focusing on developing Autodesk Vault and Autodesk Vault Office Add-ins. I work for Autodesk in Shanghai, China now.</p>
<p>I very much like to study new technologies and am especially interested in Microsoft .NET technologies. Today, I still work for the Vault products.</p>
