<p>Here are some AU classes and events for the technically oriented readers of my blog.&#0160; If you are a Vault programmer, AU is a good opportunity to get up to speed on PLM 360 and its APIs.</p>
<p>NOTE:&#0160; PLM 360 scripting and REST API are two completely different things.&#0160; People with little to no programming experience can benefit from scripting.&#0160; However, the REST API is much more complex and is geared toward programming professionals.</p>

<p>Let’s start with the content that I’ll be presenting:</p>
<p><strong>DevDays - Las Vegas - MFG Breakout Session</strong> - I’ll be going over the upcoming features in Vault.&#0160; I’ll also be going over PLM 360 for those that haven’t used it yet.&#0160; Since this is for developers, emphasis will be placed on programming and customization.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://events.au.autodesk.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=1518" target="_blank">DV1518</a> - Programming PLM 360 using REST</strong> - I’ve been working on this API for many months, so I’m looking forward to helping people get started writing custom applications.&#0160; </p>
<p><em>At the time of this writing, the PLM 360 REST API is only available to early adopters, but that may change by the time AU rolls around.</em></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://events.au.autodesk.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=1670" target="_blank">DV1670</a> - Programming the Vault with the VDF</strong> - I’ll be co-presenting this class with Dennis Mulonas, who is one of the architects on Vault.&#0160; We’ll go into the new Vault 2014 features, with emphasis on the Vault Development Framework.&#0160; </p>
<p><a href="https://events.au.autodesk.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=2227" target="_blank"><strong>DV2227</strong></a><strong> - Autodesk Cloud and Mobile API/Technologies: Meet the Experts</strong> - We gathered up all the experts on the various Autodesk cloud APIs and put them together in one room.&#0160; So come with your questions, or just sit back and listen to what others are doing.&#0160; I’ll be on the panel to field any PLM 360 questions.</p>

<p>Here are classes being presented by others:</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://events.au.autodesk.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=2948" target="_blank">MA2948</a> - High Dividend on Autodesk PLM 360 Exchange Apps</strong> - The cloud nature of PLM 360 makes this app store a bit different than for other Autodesk products.&#0160; However, there is still great opportunity for developers to “get in on the action.”</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://events.au.autodesk.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=2758" target="_blank">PL2758-P</a> PLM 360 Automation Solutions with Scripting</strong> - Get an in-depth look at scripting in PLM 360 and how it can enhance your processes.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://events.au.autodesk.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=2760" target="_blank">PL2760-L</a> PLM 360 Developers Delight - A hands on PLM 360 Scripting overview</strong> - A lab on PLM 360 scripting.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://events.au.autodesk.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=1628" target="_blank">UT1628-R</a> - Practical Integration Between Autodesk AutoCAD Utility Design and Autodesk Vault Professional</strong> - I have no idea what this is about, but it looks cool.&#0160; I’ve attended Dan Leighton’s classes in the past, and they have always been awesome.&#0160; </p>
