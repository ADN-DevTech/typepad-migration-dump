<p>Update:&#0160; <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2012/03/vlogic-2013.html" target="_self">vLogic 2013</a> has been released.</p>
<p>As promised, I came up with something for those of you who want to customize Vault through the use of scripts.&#0160; I decided to use PowerShell as the scripting engine since it has a lot of tools ready-to-use for this sort of thing.&#0160; If you are not familiar with PowerShell, you can find tons of information on the internet, including the Microsoft web site.</p>

<p><strong>vLogic Features:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>No Visual Studio required to write custom commands. </li>
<li>No compile step. </li>
<li>No deploy step. </li>
<li>Commands can be updated without having to exit Vault Explorer. </li>
<li>Easy to share scripts or modify scripts from others. </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Requirements:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Vault Workgroup/Collaboration/Professional 2012 </li>
<li>Windows PowerShell (should already be part of your OS) </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>To use:</strong></p>
<p>Run the install and start Vault Explorer.&#0160;</p>
<p>Under the Tools menu is the vLogic menu.&#0160; This is where you can run existing scripts or create new scripts.    <br />&#0160; <br />To create a new script, select Create New Command from the vLogic menu.&#0160; After giving your script a name, you will have to re-start Vault Explorer.&#0160; When the program re-starts, your command should show up in the vLogic menu.&#0160;</p>
<p>To edit a script, hold the shift key and click on the command.&#0160; The PowerShell ISE should pop up, allowing you to edit the script while Vault Explorer is running.&#0160; When you are done with your changes, save the file in the editor.</p>

<p>To run a script, run the command from the vLogic menu.</p>
<p>To delete a script, go to %ProgramData%\Autodesk\Vault 2012\Extensions\vLogic and remove the .ps1 file.&#0160; You can also add commands by putting .ps1 files in this folder.</p>

<p>There are some downsides to vLogic.&#0160; If you are not familiar with PowerShell, then it’s basically a new language that you have to learn.&#0160; If you have complex operations or UI, then you are better off using Visual Studio.&#0160; As this moment, I have no good story for debugging a vLogic script.&#0160;</p>
<p>This is just my first pass at adding scripting to Vault.&#0160; There is lots of room for improvement for future releases.</p>
