<p>Now that I am (momentarily) out of apps to post, I&#39;d like to take some time to talk about this blog.&#0160; What are the objectives?&#0160; What is the plan for the future?&#0160; That sort of thing.</p>
<p><strong>The philosophy:      <br /></strong>This blog is 100% meat.&#0160; There is no filler for fluff.&#0160; If it&#39;s not related to Vault, it&#39;s not getting posted.&#0160; There will be no vacation photos, stories about my family, movie reviews and so on.&#0160; Some other blogs do that, and that&#39;s fine, but it&#39;s just not my style.&#0160;</p>
<p>A consistent level of posting is important too.&#0160; The formula I use is 1 posting per week and 1 sample app per month.&#0160; I&#39;ve been able to keep that pace for over a year an a half, which is a decent accomplishment in my opinion.&#0160; The downside to this approach is that there is an excess of content and certain times of the year (like now with the release of Vault 2012) and a lack of content at other times (like right before a release).&#0160; The result is a slower release information so that it lasts for the whole year.&#0160; Hopefully, you are not even aware that I&#39;m doing this.&#0160; Nevertheless, let me know if there is a topic you want me to hit sooner than later.</p>
<p>Programmers are my target audience, but I&#39;m very aware that free apps is a big draw for all types of Vault users.&#0160; The two groups are very different from each other, but I haven&#39;t heard any complaints.&#0160; Regarding programmers, I want my blog to serve the whole spectrum.&#0160; From professional software engineers to hobbyists that barely know how to code.&#0160; Not every post will hit the entire range, but overall, the blog should have something for every type of programmer.</p>
<p>My blog is just part of a network of Autodesk online content.&#0160; On the Vault side alone, there is a <a href="http://underthehood-autodesk.typepad.com/" target="_blank">usage blog</a>, <a href="http://crackingthevault.typepad.com/" target="_blank">support blog</a>, <a href="http://wikihelp.autodesk.com/Vault/" target="_blank">wiki</a> and <a href="http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/Autodesk-Vault/bd-p/101" target="_blank">discussion group</a>.&#0160; The hope is that all these pieces come together to form something positive and useful.&#0160; I try my best to fill my own little niche while adding benefit to the overall network.</p>
<p><strong>Future plans:      <br /></strong>I don&#39;t have specifics or timetables or anything like that.&#0160; But I do have some ideas bouncing around in my head that I would like to start acting on in the upcoming year.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Quick start guide:</strong>&#0160; If you are new to Vault programming, I imagine the whole thing can be overwhelming.&#0160; So I will be creating a section geared specifically for getting someone coding on Vault as quickly as possible.&#0160; It may just be a page that links to some of my old posts, or it may be something more experimental, like a video tutorial series.&#0160; I&#39;ll probably start small and grow it over time. </li>
<li><strong>Developer community:</strong>&#0160; Since my blog is the de facto place to go for Vault apps, I&#39;d like to use it as a cornerstone for a development community that extends outside Autodesk.&#0160; The trick is how to do that without sucking up too much of my time. </li>
<li><strong>Retroactive updates:</strong>&#0160; As new Vault releases obsolete my older posts, I need to go back and add addendums indicating how things have changed. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Don&#39;t change what is working:      <br /></strong>I have no intention of changing anything.&#0160; Based on all the feedback I&#39;ve received (both internal to Autodesk and external) this blog is on the right track and I should keep doing what I&#39;m doing.&#0160; I have no intention of changing my rate of posting, sample apps, webinars, level of technical detail and so on.</p>
<p><strong>Final Notes:      <br /></strong>I love what I do, and hopefully it shows with every post.&#0160; Maybe one day this blogging stuff will seem like work, but I don&#39;t think that day will come anytime soon.&#0160;</p>
