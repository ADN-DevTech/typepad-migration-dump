<p><img src="/assets/Announcements2.png" /> </p> <p>If you are one of the 6.5 billion people who missed my Introduction to Vault Programming webcast, you can catch up by downloading it from our <a href="http://www.adskconsulting.com/adn/cs/api_course_webcast_archive.php">webcast archive</a>.&#0160; </p> <p>UPDATE:&#0160; The second webcast, Intermediate Vault Programming, is now posted on the webcast archive.</p> <p>NOTE:&#0160; I can&#39;t get the two live demos to view properly.&#0160; My guess is that there is a problem with the recording.&#0160; I plan on re-recording those demos and posting them sometime next month.</p>
