<p>The &quot;Project Thunderdome&quot; is alive and published updated source code and installers for 2023 and 2024 today!</p>
<p>You might have lost the track that &quot;Project Thunderdome&quot; took over the past few years when it disappeared from the App Store.</p>
<p>So there is good news about the current <strong>&quot;Thunderdome Sample&quot;</strong> code base:</p>
<ul>
<li>Access source code and installer versions on the projects &quot;Releases&quot; section for Vault 2022, 2023 and 2024</li>
<li>The latest update (2023.1, 2024.1) filters _V folders from custom folder deployments downloading files from Vault</li>
<li>The fork &quot;Thunderdome Sample&quot; is slightly different from &quot;Project Thunderdome&quot; latest app store version:
<ul>
<li>Manage deployments leveraging the role permissions of Configuration Admins instead of the built-in Administrator user</li>
<li>Include Search Groups in deployments</li>
<li>Include Data Standard Custom Help files</li>
<li>Include custom folder deployments</li>
<li>Access source code (<a href="https://github.com/koechlm/Vault-Thunderdome-Sample">Thunderdome Sample</a>) and installable versions for evaluations (<a href="https://github.com/koechlm/Vault-Thunderdome-Sample/releases">Thunderdome Sample Releases</a>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>But - you should follow the latest Vault Professional enhancements in 2024: Inventor Vault auto-deploys Design Data and Templates with a straightforward setup: Extend the Vault IPJ mapping with design data and template folders, and all Vault users stay up to date with the latest styles and templates.</strong></p>
<p>The sample extension did not adopt Vault light or dark themes for good reasons: it required a complete re-design of the admin and user dialogs based on Windows presentation foundation dialogs (leveraging the themed resources of Vault Data Standard) or would enforce individual DevExpress licensing on your side if I implemented themed forms based on the DevExpress libraries.</p>
