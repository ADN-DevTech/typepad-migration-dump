<p><strong>Update:</strong>&#0160; A <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2013/01/effective-permissions-2013.html" target="_self">Vault 2013 version</a> of this app has been released.</p>
<p>The problem with writing cool sample apps is that they have to be ported over to the new release.&#0160; So I took the opportunity to make some improvements and show off the new API features.</p>
<p><strong>Overview:</strong>   <br />Effective Folder Permissions is a set of commands that allow you to view the folder permissions on a per-user basis.</p>

<p><strong>To use:</strong>   <br />Run the install and start Vault Explorer.&#0160; There will be a new sub-menu under the tools menu and a new command in the folder context menu.&#0160; You must be an administrator to run any of the commands.</p>
<p>Additional information can be found in the readme file, which is installed in the &quot;Explorer\Extensions\EffectiveFolderPermissions&quot; folder under your client install directory.</p>
