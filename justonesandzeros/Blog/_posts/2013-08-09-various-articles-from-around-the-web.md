<p>My blog is no longer the one and only place to get Vault API information on the web, and that’s a good thing.&#0160; Every now and then I like to highlight some of the recent articles that you should take a look at...</p>
<p><a href="http://wikihelp.autodesk.com/Vault/enu/Help/Help/0378-Develope378/0379-Vault_De379" target="_blank">VDF section on the Vault Wiki</a> - There are about 8 articles here covering a variety of topics on the VDF.</p>
<p>
<a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/manufacturing/2013/07/vault-2014-iexplorerutil-vb-example.html">Vault 2014 - IExplorerUtil VB example</a> - Sample code for how to use IExplorerUtil.UpdateFileProperties(), which allows you to update mapped file properties.&#0160; It’s a useful function, but tricky to use.&#0160; Wayne Brill, from ADN, provides sample code to get you up and running.
</p>
<p><a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/manufacturing/2013/06/use-or-with-defaultacquisitionoption-to-download-checkout-with-acquirefiles.html">Use | “OR” with DefaultAcquisitionOption to Download &amp; CheckOut with AcquireFiles</a> - It’s not obvious from the Vault documentation, but some of the enums can be joined together. You will need to know this if you want to download and checkout in the same AcquireFiles call.</p>
<p><a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/manufacturing/2013/06/get-webservicemanager-in-a-vault-event-handler.html">Get WebServiceManager in a Vault Event handler</a> - Inside of a Vault Explorer Command event, it’s not very obvious how to start making calls to the Vault server.&#0160; This article shows you a simple way to get a WebServiceManager.
</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.coolorange.com/2013/07/15/updating-references-with-vault-2014-api/">Updating References with Vault 2014 API</a> - The guys at coolOrange show how you can use the VDF to trigger an update of references for your CAD files on disk.&#0160; The VDF is supposed to automatically update references on download, but there are cases where you will want to do this step explicitly in your code.</p>
<p><a href="au.autodesk.com/?nd=material&amp;session_material_id=64848" target="_self">AU class handout - Empower users with custom Vault Explorer extensions</a> - Dan Leighton takes you through a consulting project he did using Autodesk Vault and its API.&#0160; This document perfectly bridges the gap between &quot;getting started with the API&quot; and &quot;using the API on a real project.&quot;</p>
