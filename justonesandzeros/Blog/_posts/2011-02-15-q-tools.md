<p>Update:&#0160; The <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2011/07/q-2ools.html" target="_self">Vault 2012 version of this app</a> is now available.</p>
<p>Q-Tools for Autodesk Vault is my attempt to fix job server issues that I have heard about or experienced myself.&#0160; The utility is a Windows service that contains various features that you can turn on or off depending on how you want to use the job queue.&#0160; It&#39;s best if I just talk about the features themselves.</p>
<p><strong>Feature - Logging      <br /></strong>Q-Tools logs everything it determines is an &quot;issue&quot;.&#0160; You have some flexibility on defining what an issue is.&#0160; More on that later.     <br />If you are in a multi-site environment, Q-Tools will provide a single log for all queues. Logging is the only feature that you can&#39;t turn off.</p>
<p><strong>Feature - Stale Job Detection    <br /></strong>If a job has been on the queue for a long time, you can set Q-Tools to consider this an issue.&#0160; A lot of times these &quot;stale jobs&quot; mean that there is an issue with the job processor or a client queued jobs that have no handlers.</p>
<p><strong>Feature - Email Reports      <br /></strong>You can configure Q-Tools to send out an email, listing all the issues it detected.&#0160; <br /><img alt="" src="/assets/email.png" /></p>
<p><strong>Feature - Queue Cleanup      <br /></strong>If there is an job on the queue in the error state, Q-Tools can automatically log and delete it for you.&#0160; You can configure it so that only certain job types get cleaned up this way.</p>
<p><strong>Feature - Queue Forwarding      <br /></strong>In a multi-site environment each site gets its own queue.&#0160; If you would rather have one queue for all sites, Q-Tools can make this happen by letting you designate a &quot;central queue&quot;.&#0160; All jobs from other queues are forwarded to the central queue.&#0160;</p>
