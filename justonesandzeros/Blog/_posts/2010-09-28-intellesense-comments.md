<p><img src="/assets/TipsAndTricks2.png" /> </p> <p>IntelleSence is one of the best things to happen in the history of coding.&#0160; Ever.&#0160; I can&#39;t remember the last time I had to type an entire line of code.&#0160; And I don&#39;t need to tell you how helpful it is to see the entire list of function parameters as you type.</p> <p>&#0160;<img src="/assets/before.png" /> </p> <p>Well here is something to make intelleSense <strong>more useful</strong> when using the Vault API.&#0160; There are some XML files that you can put in the same folder next to the Autodesk DLLs that you link to.&#0160; When these XML files are in place Visual Studio will include <strong>comments</strong> into the intelleSense.&#0160; These are the same comments use use in the SDK documentation.</p> <p><img src="/assets/after.png" /> </p> <p>Downloads:  <br /><a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/Files/IntelleSense/Autodesk.Connectivity.Explorer.Extensibility.XML" title="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/Files/IntelleSense/Autodesk.Connectivity.Explorer.Extensibility.XML">Autodesk.Connectivity.Explorer.Extensibility.XML</a>  <br /><a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/Files/IntelleSense/Autodesk.Connectivity.JobProcessor.Extensibility.xml" title="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/Files/IntelleSense/Autodesk.Connectivity.JobProcessor.Extensibility.xml">Autodesk.Connectivity.JobProcessor.Extensibility.xml</a></p> <p>Unfortunately, we only have XML files for the Vault Client and Job Processor APIs.&#0160; Maybe I can get around to the Web Service API for the next release.</p>
