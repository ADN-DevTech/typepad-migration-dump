<p>There are a couple of features on this blog that I want to make sure everybody knows about.</p>
<p>First, at the top and bottom is a <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/sitemap.html" target="_blank">sitemap</a> link.&#0160; The site map is just a quick listing of all the major posts, grouped by category.&#0160; I find this to be better way of finding things than the date-based approach that blogs use.</p>
<p>Next, I have a <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/spotlight/" target="_blank">Spotlight</a> section, which has the intent of showcasing interesting things that people outside Autodesk are developing using the Vault API.&#0160; So far, there is only 1 entry, and it is from almost a year ago.&#0160; If I don&#39;t get more entries soon, I&#39;ll close the section down.  <br />Your application doesn&#39;t need to be a for-sale product.&#0160; Maybe you created a tool for internal use, or you did a consulting job.&#0160; I still want to hear about it and feature it.&#0160; <br />If you are interested in sharing what you did, let me know in the comments section.&#0160; I will then get in touch with you over email.</p>
