<p>I love computer games, and for years I’ve been looking for a way to make a game out of the product I was working on.&#0160; Vault didn’t really give me many options.&#0160; But writing a game in PLM 360... that’s just crazy enough to work.</p>
<p>So come with me to a land of adventure and treasure.&#0160; Of heroes and monsters.&#0160; Of wasting time writing games instead of doing more important work.&#0160; Come with me to THE DEADLY DUNGEONS OF DOOM !!!</p>

<p>If, for some reason, you want to play this game, <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/Apps/DungeonsOfDoom/DungeonsOfDoom-plmConfig.zip" target="_blank">here are the scripts I used</a>.&#0160; I also used the <a href="http://help.autodesk.com/view/PLM/ENU/?guid=GUID-7CCC759C-D26A-40AB-A4F3-3B3A323BF0AE" target="_blank">REST API</a> to dump out the Workspace objects in JSON format.&#0160; It contains the Item Details information, but not the grid, relationship or workflow settings.&#0160; There is currently no easy way to import the JSON data, so you would have to set everything up by hand.&#0160;</p>
