<p>No surprises here.&#0160; The app is a good concept, but just didn’t pan out.&#0160; I like to write apps that fill functionality holes in Vault.&#0160; But scripting isn’t something I can build-in with an app.&#0160; </p>

<p>Based on the results, the obvious conclusion is to kill it.&#0160; The one person who said they used vLogic in production didn’t specify what it’s being used for.&#0160; The source code is available for those who what to keep it alive.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; </p>
<p>Thanks again to everyone who took the survey.</p>
