<p>Please go to the <a href="http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/vault-customization/bd-p/301">Vault Customization discussion group</a> if you have any questions about the Vault API.&#0160; Don’t use the comments section in this blog.</p>
<p>There are a few reasons for this:&#0160;</p>
<ol>
<li>The discussion group is monitored by the Vault team and the Autodesk Developer Network.&#0160; So more people will see your question and respond.</li>
<li>The discussion group is better designed for highly-detailed questions.&#0160; You can have formatted text, code snippets, file attachments and so on.</li>
<li>Your question may have already been answered.&#0160; You can easily search the discussion group to see if there are similar issues.</li>
<li>I’m no longer on the Vault team.&#0160; I actually left about 2 years ago, so it’s getting hard for me to provide detailed help.</li>
</ol>
