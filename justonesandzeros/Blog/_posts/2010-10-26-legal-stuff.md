<p>Autodesk is an American company, which means there is no such thing as having too many legal disclaimers.&#0160; Therefore I would like to re-iterate parts of the <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/disclaimer.html" target="_blank">legal disclaimer</a> for this blog.&#0160;</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" width="450">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="450">Any applications on this blog are <strong>experimental</strong> in nature. They have not been tested in any manner, and Autodesk does not represent that they are reliable, accurate, complete, or otherwise valid. Accordingly, those applications are provided “as is” with no warranty of any kind and you <strong>use the applications at your own risk</strong>.</td>
</tr>

</table>
<p>In other words, you are free to use the applications (and source code) in your Vault, but the burden is on you to test and make sure it is suitable for your environment.&#0160; There is definitely a difference between my small development vault and a production Vault with hundreds of concurrent users.</p>
<p>That is all.</p>
