<p>What do Abraham Lincoln, Genghis Khan and Mozart have in common?&#0160; Besides being dead, I really don’t know.&#0160; But that’s OK because it has nothing to do with this article.</p>
<p>This article is about the new <a href="http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/Autodesk-Vault-Idea-Exchange/idb-p/2" target="_blank">Autodesk Vault Idea Exchange</a>, which is where you (yes, <em>you</em>) get to propose Vault features.&#0160; Although we have many avenues for requesting features, such as discussion groups, the Idea Exchange is built specifically for this purpose.</p>
<p>Ideas can be posted, discussed and tracked.&#0160; You can also vote on ideas using the Kudos system.&#0160; Kudos is like “Like” in Facebook.&#0160; If you see something you agree with, you click on the Kudos button, and the Kudos number for that feature goes up +1.&#0160; The ideas with the most Kudos show up higher in the list.&#0160;</p>
<p>So go forth and <a href="http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/Autodesk-Vault-Idea-Exchange/idb-p/2">give us your ideas</a>.&#0160; API suggestions are fair game.&#0160; In fact, you are almost guaranteed a Kudos from me if you post an API related idea.&#0160; Yummy!</p>
