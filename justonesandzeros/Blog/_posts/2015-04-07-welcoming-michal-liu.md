<p>You may have noticed that the last couple of articles have come from a new blogger.&#0160; Please join me in welcoming <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/michal-liu.html">Michal Liu</a> to the blogosphere.&#0160; He is the scripting expert on the PLM 360 development team.&#0160; After 5+ years of running this blog, it’s nice to get some new blood.&#0160;</p>
<p>It’s also nice to have some PLM 360 focus.&#0160; It’s a highly configurable product with a powerful scripting engine.&#0160; You can do some really cool things with it.&#0160; There are also right and wrong ways to use it, so it’s good to have a technical guide.</p>
<p>If there is a specific topic you would like covered, let Michal know.&#0160; Speaking from experience, feedback is always welcome.&#0160;</p>
