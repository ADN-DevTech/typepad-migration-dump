<p>If you want to see the new API features or get a head-start updating your code, you can <a href="http://beta.autodesk.com/callout/default.html?callid={5B489D3A-7229-495D-BE01-5E5728A2165C}" target="_blank">sign up for the Vault Beta</a>.&#0160;</p>
<p>The Beta features a full SDK, including documentation, samples and utilities.&#0160; There are some nice new API features that I am excited about.&#0160; I can&#39;t go into any specifics on this blog, but I&#39;ll be active in the Beta forums answering questions and listening to feedback.</p>
<p>See you there!</p>
