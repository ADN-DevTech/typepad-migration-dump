<p>If you are getting started with the Vault API, there is a lot of information out there.&#0160; Unfortunately, it’s all over the place.&#0160; Some of it is on this blog, some of it is on AU Virtual, some of it is on ADN.&#0160; Here is my attempt to fix all that.&#0160; I’ll be doing a 5 part webinar series, covering all the major aspects of the Vault 2012 API.</p>
<p>In total, there will be about 4.5 hours of content for the low price of free.&#0160; If you do the math, that’s an infinite amount of content per dollar!</p>
<p>This series is perfect for those of you new to Vault programming or those of you that want a refresher course.&#0160;</p>
