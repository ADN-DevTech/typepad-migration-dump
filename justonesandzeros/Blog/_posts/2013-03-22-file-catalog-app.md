<p>Here’s my latest Vault app.&#0160; It creates a File Record, which is a copy of a file’s property data.&#0160; I created the app for people who want to delete a Vault file but keep the meta-data around.&#0160; I’m sure there are other uses too.&#0160; Anyway, have a look a the demo video.</p>

<p>As with most of my apps, there is a lot of room for improvement.&#0160; Currently, it focuses only on properties from the latest file version.&#0160; It does not attempt to record file history, file relationships, or relationships to items and change orders.</p>
