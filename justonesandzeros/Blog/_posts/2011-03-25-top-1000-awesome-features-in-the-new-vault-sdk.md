<p>Now that Vault 11111011100 has been released, I can now talk about the cool new SDK features.&#0160; There are a bunch of things that I can talk about, but for now, I&#39;ll just list the top 1000 features.</p>
<p><strong>Feature 0000:&#0160; Events      <br /></strong>You can now get Pre and Post events whenever a Vault application performs certain actions, such as checking in a file.&#0160; There is also a GetRestrictions event which allows you to block the operation.</p>
<p><strong><strong>Feature </strong>0001:&#0160; Access to Client-side functionality      <br /></strong>Call directly into Vault Explorer to run tasks like update properties or get the working folder.</p>
<p><strong><strong>Feature </strong>0010:&#0160; More VB       <br /></strong>Inline code samples are now in VB.Net as well as C#.&#0160; The job server sample app is now also in VB.Net.</p>
<p><strong><strong>Feature </strong>0011:&#0160; Lifecycle event jobs for Items and Change Orders       <br /></strong>The Lifecycle Event Editor has been expanded beyond just files.&#0160; <br /> <img alt="" src="/assets/LifecycleEventEditor_scaled.png" /></p>
<p><strong><strong>Feature </strong>0100:&#0160; FileVersion selection type      <br /></strong>You can now run custom commands from files selected in the History, Uses and Where Used tabs.</p>
<p><strong><strong>Feature </strong>0101:&#0160; WebServiceManager       <br /></strong>A factory/manager for web service objects has been built right in to the API.</p>
<p><strong>Feature 0110:&#0160; Automatic re-sign in      <br /></strong>If you use the provided WebServiceManager, by default the web services will automatically re-authenticate if you Vault credentials go stale.</p>
<p><strong><strong>Feature </strong>0111:&#0160; Intellesense comments       <br /></strong>See the API documentation right as you code in Visual Studio.     <br /><img alt="" src="/assets/intellesense.png" /></p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>I&#39;ll be going into each of these features and more in the upcoming months.&#0160; This post was just to give you a taste of things to come (and test your knowledge of binary numbers).</p>
