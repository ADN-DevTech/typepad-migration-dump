<p>I&#39;ve had some requests to write a Vault extension that talks to <a href="http://bluestreak.autodesk.com/">Bluestreak</a>.&#0160; There is only one problem, I have no idea how the thing would work.&#0160; Sure, I could talk with some of the Vault product designers and the Bluestreak team to get more information.&#0160; But I&#39;m going to try something experimental.&#0160; I&#39;m going to let <strong>you</strong>, my readers, design the thing.</p>
<p>If you have an idea, sent it to doug.redmond AT autodesk.com.&#0160; Feel free to include things like features, workflows and even rough UI sketches.</p>
<p>Some things to note:</p>
<ul>
<li>My time is limited.&#0160; Just like with all my other sample apps, this is a side project.&#0160; So don&#39;t get too complex in your feature requests.</li>
<li>I reserve the right to not implement your request for any reason.&#0160; Try not to take it personal. </li>
<li>I&#39;m going to start coding soon, and I code <em>fast</em>, so don&#39;t wait to make your suggestions. </li>
</ul>
