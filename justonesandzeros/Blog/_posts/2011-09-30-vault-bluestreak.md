<p>I finally completed a connector between Vault and <a href="http://bluestreak.autodesk.com/">Bluestreak</a>.&#0160; A while back I <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2011/07/bluestreak-and-vault-you-design-it-i-code-it.html">asked for feedback</a>, and the response was pretty minimal.&#0160; But, there was a common theme: file upload.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="/assets/UploadCommand.png" /></p>
<p>In addition to the upload feature, my extension will add items to your activity stream in Bluestreak.&#0160; It will log activities whenever you move a file or item to a released state.&#0160; It will also log all change order state changes.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="/assets/ActivityStream.png" /></p>
<p>That&#39;s about it for now.&#0160; This is just a first pass at something between Vault and Bluestreak.&#0160; There is a lot of room for new features and improvements.&#0160; If the response to this app is good, there may be updates in the near future.</p>
