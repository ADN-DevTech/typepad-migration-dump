<p>The Autodesk Developer Network is putting on their biennial DevCamps this year.&#0160; There is one for Manufacturing and one for AEC, and I’ll be going to both of them.&#0160; I’ll be lecturing on how to diversify your stock portfolio.&#0160; Just kidding, I’ll be hosting classes about the Vault API.</p>
<p>If you don’t know what a DevCamp is, let me give you my rundown.&#0160; It’s basically 3 days of API related content.&#0160; There are a variety of classes offered, covering all the major APIs.&#0160; There are also the DevLabs were you can hang out and get API help from the experts.&#0160; Feel free to bring in your laptop and source code!</p>
<p>But the camps go beyond pure technical content.&#0160; The events are held near the division headquarters so you get to meet and mingle with the development teams.&#0160; You also get to hear the Autodesk VPs to talk about product strategy.&#0160;</p>
