<p>Today is the 2 year anniversary of this blog.&#0160; So I would like to do a recap of some of the highlights from the past year.</p>
<p><strong>App Mania</strong></p>
<p>Not surprisingly, the free apps continue to be very popular.&#0160; This year it wasn&#39;t just me writing all the apps.&#0160; Other Autodesk developers got in the act with awesome apps like, <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2011/06/drawing-compare.html">Drawing Compare</a>, <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2011/04/vault-gadget.html">Vault Gadget</a>, and a <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2011/03/google-map-extension.html">Google Map plug-in</a>.</p>
<p>The downside is that there are <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2011/04/help-too-many-sample-apps.html">too many legacy apps to upgrade</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Videos</strong></p>
<p>I try to do a webinar series each year.&#0160; Back in December I did a <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2011/01/webinar-videos.html">set of case studies</a> using some of my apps as examples.&#0160; The result is almost 4 hours of video where I talk through my own source code.&#0160; At first I was hesitant, thinking that audiences would find it too boring.&#0160; But the webcasts were well received, so I&#39;ll probably use the &quot;case study&quot; format more in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Advanced Content</strong></p>
<p>A lot of my blog articles are focused on specific features, such as <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2011/04/faq-events.html">Events</a>, <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2011/04/goodbye-shares-hello-links.html">Links</a> and <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2011/05/file-resolution.html">File Resolution</a>.&#0160; Although articles like that are useful, they are a bit on the dry side.&#0160; It&#39;s like writing a textbook chapter.</p>
<p>It&#39;s nice when I can break out of that format and go deeper that just a single feature.&#0160; <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2011/03/coding-for-performance-getting-all-files.html">Coding for Performance</a> articles.&#0160; I hope to continue the series this year, and maybe I&#39;ll be able to come up with another series along those lines.</p>
<p><strong>Tech Support</strong></p>
<p>Vault 2012 marks the first time there were bugs in the API itself.&#0160; In those cases, the blog became a mechanism for communicating <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2011/04/issues-with-the-vault-2012-api.html">workarounds</a> and <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2011/06/2-api-related-hotfixes.html">hotfixes</a>.&#0160;</p>
<p>And there&#39;s the comments sections, which have been used for tech support from time to time.&#0160; However, the new <a href="http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/Autodesk-Vault-Customization/bd-p/301">Vault API newsgroup</a> is usually the better way to get API support.&#0160; Either way, the odds are good that you will get a response from me.</p>
