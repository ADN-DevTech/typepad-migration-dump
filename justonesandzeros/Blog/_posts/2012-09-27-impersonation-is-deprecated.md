<p>A while back I talked about the <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2012/08/impersonation.html" target="_blank">impersonation</a> feature in the Vault 2013 API.&#0160; Unfortunately, we will <strong>not</strong> be supporting that feature in the next release of Vault.&#0160; This decision was made very recently, and I wanted to spread the news as soon as possible.</p>
<p>If you are already making use of this feature, let me know in the comments section.&#0160; I’ll make sure your concerns are forwarded to the right people. </p>
