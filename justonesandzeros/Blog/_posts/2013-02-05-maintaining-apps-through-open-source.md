<p>I have a lot of apps on this site.&#0160; And several of them are quite good, if I do say so myself.&#0160; But there is always room for improvement.&#0160; I frequently get suggestions on how to make something better.&#0160; If I had an infinite amount of time, I would implement all these suggestions.&#0160; But I don’t have that kind of time.&#0160; So improvements either have to be postponed indefinitely or somebody else has to write them.</p>
<p>That brings me to the Open Source approach to software development.&#0160; Technically, my apps are already open source because I post the source code.&#0160; But when it comes to updates, there is no way for an outside party to contribute to the app.</p>
<p>Things like <a class="zem_slink" href="http://sourceforge.net" rel="homepage" target="_blank" title="SourceForge">SourceForge</a> have been suggested to me in the past, and it’s a good suggestion.&#0160; But a lot of details need to be worked out before I head down that path.&#0160; The main problem is that, as far as I know, Autodesk doesn’t have a good policy for this sort of thing.&#0160; I would need to work out the details with my bosses, product managers, legal department, etc.&#0160; The whole thing could get shot down at any point.</p>
<p>Of course, the whole effort would be for nothing I’m the only one contributing to it.&#0160; There is not much incentive for somebody to contribute on a free app.&#0160; It might be better to ignore open source and just focus on mechanisms that offer a monetary rewarded.&#0160; For example, I know that some consulting companies are modifying my apps for specific customer contracts.&#0160; I’m fine with that.&#0160; I’m also fine with somebody taking my app, adding features to it, putting it up on the <a href="http://apps.exchange.autodesk.com/VLTC/Home/Index" target="_blank">Vault app store</a>, and charging for it.</p>
<p>If you have an opinion, please fill out the survey below.&#0160; I’d love to hear your thoughts.&#0160; </p>
