<p><img src="/assets/Concepts2.png" /> </p> <p>If you have upgraded to Vault 2011, you may have noticed some changes regarding how properties work.&#0160; And when I say &quot;some changes,&quot; I really mean &quot;many changes.&quot;&#0160; Actually, &quot;re-architecture&quot; is probably a better term to describe what we did to properties.</p> <p>If you read my <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2009/11/file-properties-explained.html">earlier article on properties</a>, feel free to forget it.&#0160; Some of it is still relevant, but some of it isn&#39;t.&#0160; So to make things easy, I&#39;ll just start over from the beginning.</p> <p>One more thing, make sure to read my <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2010/05/entities.html">article on Entities</a>.&#0160; The new property architecture doesn&#39;t even begin to make sense until you understand Entities.</p> <p><strong>At a High Level:</strong>   <br />Properties are a type of Behavior, which basically means it&#39;s a feature that works on Entities instead of specific object types.&#0160; There are 2 things we do with this concept:&#0160; 1) we consolidate the feature and 2) we allow data to be shared across entity types.</p> <p>These concepts can be seen on the Properties dialog (Tools menu-&gt;Administration-&gt;Vault Settings-&gt;Behaviors tab-&gt;Properties button).&#0160; Everything is in one dialog instead of being separated by File, Item and Change Order.</p> <p><img src="/assets/PropDef1.png" /> </p> <p>This dialog gives you a nice list of Property Definitions.&#0160; Notice how each definition is associated with 1 or more entity classes.&#0160; This is nice because you can define a property definition once and use it multiple places.&#0160; A property definition can only work with entity classes that it is associated with.</p> <p>You can also associate property definitions with categories.&#0160; This allows you to change the behavior of the property depending on the category that the entity is.&#0160; This feature allows for more specialization while still promoting reuse.</p> <p><a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2010/PropertiesInVault2011/PropDef2-full.png"><img border="0" src="/assets/PropDef2-scaled.png" style="border: 0px none ;" /></a>   <br /><font color="#808080">(click image for the full size view)</font></p> <p><strong>System Properties and UDPs:</strong>   <br />Properties maintained by Vault are either System properties or User Defined Properties (UDPs).&#0160; The main difference is that UDPs values can be edited directly, and system property values are set by the system.&#0160; At the property definition level, system properties have only a few edit options.&#0160; Likewise, system properties cannot be added or deleted.&#0160; </p> <p><strong>Content Source Properties:</strong>   <br />Vault Properties do many things.&#0160; They fill in the data grids, they allow searching, they allow lifecycle state restrictions, etc.&#0160; All this is possible because Vault &quot;owns&quot; this data.&#0160; Vault keeps the data in its tables and indexes, and everything is organized to support the Vault features.&#0160; </p> <p>But what about properties not owned by Vault?&#0160; Those properties aren&#39;t organized by Vault and aren&#39;t in a format that Vault recognizes.&#0160; We refer to these as Content Source Properties because they are <strong>content</strong> form a <strong>source</strong> other than Vault.&#0160; So how can Vault work with this data?</p> <p>The solution is to map the content source property to a UDP.&#0160; That way Vault can do all it&#39;s operations on the UDP without having to know or care about the mechanics of the content source property. </p> <p>The glue between the content source property and the UDP is a module called a Content Source Provider.&#0160; It contains the logic to read and/or write content source properties and interact with the Vault framework.&#0160; These providers are broken up by file type.&#0160; So there is one for AutoCAD and one for Inventor and so on.&#0160; There is also an &quot;All Files&quot; provider to handle all files not claimed by another provider.</p> <p><strong>Coming Up...   <br /></strong>That&#39;s all I have for this article.&#0160; Next week, I&#39;ll go into some of the specifics of <strong>File properties</strong>.&#0160; Then after that, I&#39;ll post an article on <strong>Item properties</strong>.</p>
