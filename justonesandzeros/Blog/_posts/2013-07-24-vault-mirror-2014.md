<p><strong>Update:</strong>&#0160; Vault Mirror 2014 is now up on the <a href="http://apps.exchange.autodesk.com/VLTC/en/Detail/Index?id=appstore.exchange.autodesk.com%3aautodeskvaultmirror2014%3aen" target="_blank">app store</a></p>
<p>I’m tired of waiting, so I put out my own version of Vault Mirror for 2014.&#0160; Vault Mirror is my baby, and nobody puts baby in a corner.&#0160; This hasn’t gone through the proper level of QA, which is why it’s on my blog instead of the app store.&#0160; Maybe it will make its way up to the app store, or maybe it won’t.&#0160; Whatever the outcome, I have you covered.&#0160; Click on the link below to download Vault Mirror 2014.&#0160; To use, just unzip and run.</p>
<p><strong>Requirements:</strong>     <br />Vault Basic/Workgroup/Professional 2014</p>
<p><a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/Apps/VaultMirror/VaultMirror-7.0.1.0-bin.zip" target="_blank">Click here to download the application</a>    <br /><a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/Apps/VaultMirror/VaultMirror-7.0.1.0-src.zip" target="_blank">Click here to download the source code<br /></a> </p>
<p><strong>New features:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>New command line option: <strong>-WF</strong>.&#0160; Downloads files based on your working folder settings. </li>
<li>New command line option: <strong>-noFail</strong>.&#0160; If there is a download error, Vault Mirror moves to the next file instead of immediately aborting. </li>
<li>The cancel button actually works.&#0160; In the past 6 releases, hitting the cancel button didn’t actually cancel the operation.&#0160; Nobody seemed to mind, but I thought I should fix it anyway. </li>
</ul>
