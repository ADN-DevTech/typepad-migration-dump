<p>Although AU is just 3 days long, there are plenty of events going on before and after.&#0160; One such event is DevDays, which is put together by the <a href="http://www.autodesk.com/joinadn" target="_blank">Autodesk Developer Network</a>.&#0160; <a href="http://au.autodesk.com/las-vegas/pre-conference/adn-conference-devlab" target="_blank">DevDays</a> is the Monday before AU, and I highly recommend checking it out.&#0160; There you will learn about updates to all the major products, cloud APIs (present and future), mobile apps, and desktop apps.&#0160; It’s definitely worth coming in a day early for (not that you need an excuse to stay an extra day in Vegas).</p>
<p>I will be there in the Manufacturing breakout session going over Vault updates and the new PLM 360 REST API.&#0160; So feel free to say hi, talk shop about Vault and/or PLM 360 development, get my autograph, etc.</p>
<p>If you can’t make it to AU, there is a good chance DevDays will be coming to a <a href="http://developer-days.autodesk-services.com/" target="_blank">location near you</a> soon.</p>
