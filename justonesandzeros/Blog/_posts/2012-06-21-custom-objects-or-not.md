<p>I have a dilemma, so I need you guys to fill out a quick survey for me.&#0160; On one hand I want to take advantage of the Custom Objects feature with my apps.&#0160; On the other hand, using that feature restricts the app to Vault Professional only.</p>
<p>For example, the 2013 version of <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2011/05/thunderdome-2.html" target="_blank">Project Thunderdome</a> could do some really cool things with custom objects, but any Workgroup/Collab users would be unable to use it.</p>
<p>Please take my 2 question survey to let me know what I should focus on.</p>
<p>UPDATE:&#0160; Survey is now closed.</p>
