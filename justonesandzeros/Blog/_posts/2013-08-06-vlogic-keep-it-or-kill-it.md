<p><strong>Update:</strong>&#0160; The survey is closed.&#0160; Thanks to everyone who participated.&#0160; Here are <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2013/08/vlogic-survey-results.html" target="_self">the results</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2012/03/vlogic-2013.html" target="_blank">vLogic</a> app, my attempt at adding scripting to Vault, didn’t really turn out as I had hoped.&#0160; The scripts are difficult to write and debug.&#0160; I didn’t get much response on the app either.&#0160; So I’m thinking of not updating it for 2014, but I thought I would give the community a chance to speak up.&#0160; </p>
<p>I put together a quick survey to help me decide if I should keep it or kill it.&#0160; (Of course, the source code is available, so anybody can put out their own update if I decide to “kill” it.)</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
