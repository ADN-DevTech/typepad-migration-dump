<p><strong>Update:</strong>&#0160; The survey is closed.&#0160; Thanks to all who participated.</p>
<p>Recently my videos are turning out much longer than I intend them to be.&#0160; For example, I intended only 10 minutes for <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2013/07/deco-tips-and-tricks.html" target="_blank">DECO tips and tricks</a>, but I wound up with a 25 minute video after editing.&#0160; Maybe this is a problem I need to fix, or maybe it isn’t.&#0160; Maybe things are perfect the way they are.&#0160; </p>
<p>To help me find an answer, please take this short survey.&#0160; Thanks!</p>
