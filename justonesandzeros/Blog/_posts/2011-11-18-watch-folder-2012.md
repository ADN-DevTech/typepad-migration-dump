<p>Update:&#0160; <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2012/05/q-tools-and-watch-folder-2013.html" target="_self">Watch Folder 2013</a> is now available.</p>
<p>Looking for that perfect gift to give this year?&#0160; Why not give the gift of Watch Folder?!&#0160; I just updated it to work with Vault 2012, and I added in support for HTML style emails.</p>
<p>In case you aren&#39;t familiar with it, Watch Folder is an app that allows you to &quot;watch&quot; a set of Vault folders so that you receive email notifications when files get added or updated in those folders.&#0160;</p>

<p><strong>Requirements:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Vault Workgroup/Collaboration/Professional 2012 </li>
<li>Job Server enabled </li>
<li>An SMTP server somewhere on the network </li>
</ul>
<p>NOTE:&#0160; This isn&#39;t something you can just download and run.&#0160; The Vault administrator needs to set up some server components before this feature can be used.</p>

<p><a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/Apps/WatchFolder/WatchFolder-Hotfix-2.0.3.0.zip" target="_self">Click here for the 2.0.3.0 hotfix</a> - Applies only to the Job Processor component.</p>

<p><strong>To use</strong></p>
<p>For Vault users, download the application and run the installer.&#0160; Just make sure that the administrator has set up the Vault environment first.&#0160; Next, start up Vault Explorer and right-click on a folder that you want to watch.&#0160; Select the Watch Folder command and decide how frequently you want notifications.</p>

<hr noshade="noshade" style="color: #013181;" />
<p>For Vault administrators, download the application and run the installer.&#0160; Next follow the instructions in the readme file in the install folder (%ProgramData%\Autodesk\Vault 2012\Extensions\WatchFolderCommand).</p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A watch on a folder will automatically apply to any sub-folders. </li>
<li>Removing a watch will also remove watches on sub-folders. </li>
<li>You can&#39;t have an immediate watch and a summary watch on the same folder.&#0160; Setting a folder to one type overwrites the existing setting. </li>
<li>You need to be at least Document Editor (level 1) in order to set up a watch on a folder. </li>
<li>You need to have a valid email address in your Vault user settings. </li>
<li>The contents of the email can be customized by the Vault administrator.&#0160; See readme file. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Migrating from version 1:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The admin install is still a lot of steps.&#0160; I did a bit of consolidation, the Job Processor plug-in and the Vault Explorer plug-in have been combined.</li>
<li>All the settings files from R1 can still be used, just copy over WatchCollection.xml, WatchSettings.xml and WatchEmailBody.txt over to the install folder.</li>
<li>I recommend updating WatchSettings to use an HTML file instead of a text file.&#0160; There are more formatting options and you can have hyperlinks.</li>
<li>More file informaiton can be provided in the email.&#0160; See readme for more details.</li>
</ul>
