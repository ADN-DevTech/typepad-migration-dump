<p>Update:&#0160; The <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2012/08/project-thunderdome-2013.html" target="_self">2013 version</a> is available.</p>
<p>Here is the new version of <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2010/11/project-thunderdome.html" target="_blank">Project Thunderdome</a>.&#0160; It&#39;s mostly the same app as before, but now updated to work with Vault 2012.</p>
<p>It still pulls down updates.<img alt="" src="/assets/UpdatesFound.png" /></p>
<p>It still has the &quot;Users Folder&quot; concept.   <br /><img alt="" src="/assets/UsersFolder-normal.png" /></p>
<p>And you can still backup your settings.   <br /><img alt="" src="/assets/backupCommand.png" /></p>
<p>There are some minor fixes.&#0160; For example, if an extension gets installed, a menu reset is performed.&#0160;</p>
<p>If you have a Web Service event handler, Project Thunderdome can pull that down too.&#0160; Vault 2012 has the concept of an <strong>Extension</strong>, which encompasses both custom commands and web service command event handlers.&#0160; Thunderdome will pull down an extension, regardless of type.</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p><strong>Requirements:</strong> <br />Vault Workgroup/Collaboration/Professional 2012</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong>&#0160; The tool has been updated to fix an issue where settings files were being set as read-only.&#0160; The links above are to version, 2.0.2.0, which has the fix.</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p><strong>Upgrading from Vault 2011</strong></p>
<p>The settings are different from Vault 2011 and Vault 2012.&#0160; So if you are pushing out settings and extensions, make sure they are synced to Vault 2012.</p>
<p>Likewise if you have saved settings, you will might want to clear those out and re-save with your Vault 2012 settings.</p>
