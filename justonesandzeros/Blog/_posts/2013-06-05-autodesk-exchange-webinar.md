<p>There is an upcoming webinar on writing apps for the Autodesk Exchange App store.&#0160; In case you didn’t know already, Autodesk has an app store called <a href="http://apps.exchange.autodesk.com">Autodesk Exchange</a>.&#0160; There are “stores” for 15 products, including <a href="http://apps.exchange.autodesk.com/VLTC/en/Home/Index">Vault</a>.&#0160; So it’s a great way to promote yourself, promote your company and/or make some extra cash.</p>

<p><strong>Webinar details:</strong></p>
<p>Date: Thursday, June 13<sup>th</sup>, 2013     <br />Time: 8 a.m. PDT (4 p.m. BST; 5 p.m. CET; 11 a.m. EDT)     <br />Duration: Approximately one hour</p>
<p>Open to anyone interested in publishing apps on Autodesk Exchange Apps (i.e. ADN membership is not required :-).</p>
<p><strong>Registration:</strong> Reserve your place by June 11 by sending an email to <a href="mailto:%20adn-training-worldwide@autodesk.com?subject=Exchange_Apps_webinar">adn-training-worldwide@autodesk.com</a> with <em>Exchange Apps webinar</em> as the subject.

<p>If you don’t know what to build, that’s OK, <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/sample-applications/">I have plenty of apps you could write</a>.&#0160; That’s right, you can take one of my apps, update it for the latest Vault release, put it on the app store, and charge for it.&#0160; I’m totally OK with that!&#0160; It’s a win for you (extra cash from some else’s code), a win for Vault (more functionality) and a win for me (I don’t have to update the app).&#0160; </p>
<p>All I ask is that you don’t use the orange “Ones and Zeros” logo and you include your company in the name (ex. MyCo’s Hyperlink Maestro).&#0160; </p>
<p>If you don’t want to steal my code, you can also get plenty of ideas from the <a href="http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/Autodesk-Vault-IdeaStation/idb-p/2">Vault Idea Station</a>.&#0160; I frequently visit that site and say “I could write an app for that, if I only had the time.”</p>
