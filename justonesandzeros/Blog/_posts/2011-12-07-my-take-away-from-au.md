<p>I was busy at AU last week, which is why there wasn&#39;t much activity from me online.&#0160; I&#39;m not going to repeat AU news that has already been <a href="http://underthehood-autodesk.typepad.com/blog/2011/11/what-happened-in-vegasau2011-diary-day-2.html">posted elsewhere</a> (PLM, Autodesk 360, etc), that&#39;s not what this blog is about.&#0160; I&#39;ll keep things focused on the Vault API and share some things I learned.</p>
<p>Yes, I learn things at AU.&#0160; Not things about the Vault API, but how people perceive and use the Vault API.&#0160; The more I understand my users, the better I can distribute information.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve known for some time that the API consumers fall into two camps, the professional programmers and the non-professional &quot;scripters&quot;.&#0160; Since I&#39;m a professional programmer myself, I&#39;m good at providing information targeted at the first group.&#0160; The second group is where I rely heavily on feedback.</p>

<p><strong>The Scripter persona</strong></p>
<p>Let me take a crack at describing the Scripter (feel free to let me know if I missed something).&#0160; This person wants to customize the Vault but doesn&#39;t want to spend days learning the entire Vault API.&#0160; Usually they want to write tools tailored to their own environment.&#0160; There is a task that they do over and over and they want to automate the process or reduce mouse clicks.&#0160; The best-case scenario for them is to find a similar tool that they can tailor to their own needs.&#0160; Having to start from scratch is a big pain and sometimes a show stopper.</p>
<p>Cost of entry is also a big factor.&#0160; It&#39;s very important that a scripter can get something working early on, even if its just a Hello World example.&#0160; Spending hours figuring out how to get a command to load is not acceptable.&#0160;</p>

<p><strong>Feedback</strong></p>
<p>Most of the feedback I get from scripters is positive so I&#39;d like to share that with you.&#0160; I don&#39;t get much feedback on things that aren&#39;t working, but I do get questions like &quot;Do you have an app that does X?&quot;</p>
<p><strong>The good:</strong>&#0160; <strong>SDK Samples</strong> <br />These examples are easy to read and easy for scripters to modify.     <br /><strong>How to make it better:</strong>&#0160; More samples in the same style.&#0160; In other words, samples that illustrate one useful concept in a clear and simple way.&#0160;</p>
<p><strong>The good:</strong>&#0160; <strong>.NET</strong> <br />It&#39;s an easy-to-use and powerful programming platform.&#0160; It&#39;s free and supports VB.     <br /><strong>How to make it better:</strong>&#0160; Get rid of the &quot;compile&quot; step.&#0160; This goes back to reducing cost-of-entry.&#0160; The less steps equals lower cost-of-entry.&#0160; And, technically, scripting means that the code does not need to be compiled.&#0160; There are a couple of techniques that can help with this goal, such as PowerShell and run-time compilation.&#0160; I haven&#39;t yet taken a serious look at these techniques, but it&#39;s on my agenda.</p>
