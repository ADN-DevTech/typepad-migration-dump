<p><img src="/assets/Concepts2.png" /> </p> <p>Shares is a feature that dates all the way to Vault 1 and maybe even earlier.&#0160; It&#39;s still around in Vault 2010, but mainly for legacy purposes.&#0160; If you are new to Vault, odds are you never even heard of shares.&#0160; Even though the feature isn&#39;t used often, the fact that it&#39;s there affects other parts of the system.</p> <p>This article isn&#39;t about whether shares are good or bad, and I&#39;m not going to advocate use or non-use.&#0160; I&#39;m just going to go over the purely technical details. </p> <p><strong>Concept:</strong>  <br />A share is the idea that a file can live in multiple folders equally.&#0160; The word &quot;equally&quot; is what makes things unique.&#0160; It&#39;s not like Windows where a file lives in only 1 location and you can create shortcuts.&#0160; With Vault, the file truly lives in multiple locations.&#0160; There is no shortcut, there is no primary folder, there is no folder prioritization.&#0160; The file lives in each folder equally.&#0160; A file has to live in at least one folder, but there is no upper limit.</p> <p>Likewise, a shared file is the exact same file in all locations.&#0160; The file is not copied to different folders or anything like that.&#0160; They are truly the same object.&#0160; Change anything about the file in one location, and you change it for all locations.</p> <p><strong>Effects:</strong>  <br />Here are some of the ways that shares impact other Vault features:</p> <ul>
  <li>It&#39;s harder&#0160; to get the folder that a file lives in or to &quot;jump to&quot; a file.&#0160; Even if the file lives in only 1 folder, it <em>could</em> live in multiple folders.</li>
  <li>There&#39;s no Folder property on a File object.</li>
  <li>When you delete a file you are really just deleting it from the share.&#0160; The file will still be around if it lives in other shares.&#0160; To truly delete a file, you need to delete it from every folder that it lives in.</li>
  <li>When you move a file, you are just changing the location of one of the shares.</li>
  <li>If you set security on a folder, all files in the folder get updated with the folder&#39;s security settings.&#0160; This is still true even if the file is shared.&#0160; So it&#39;s a &quot;last one wins model&quot; where the file has the security settings of the parent folder that updated security last.</li>
  <li>On a user&#39;s local folder, a shared file gets downloaded to multiple locations as separate Windows files.&#0160; However, on the Vault Server&#39;s file store, there is only 1 copy.</li>
  <li>At the API level, you can find all the file shares with GetFoldersByFileMasterId.&#0160; The Folders are not returned in any order, so don&#39;t assume any sort of prioritization.&#0160; In fact, the order my change from call to call.</li>
 </ul>
