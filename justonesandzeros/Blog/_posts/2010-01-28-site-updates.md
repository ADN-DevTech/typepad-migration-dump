<p>I made some minor site updates.&#0160; There is now a <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/sitemap.html" target="_self">site map</a> for a quick listing of all the articles by category.&#0160; I also updated my <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/doug-redmond-v2.html">bio page</a>.&#0160; Any useful information about me has been removed and replaced with personal details that you probably don&#39;t want to know.</p>
