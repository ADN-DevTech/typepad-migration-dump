<p>In Vault 2013, we shifted over to .NET 4.&#0160; This isn’t just an API change, the product itself shifted too.&#0160; In fact, I think all Autodesk products using .NET were told to shift over.&#0160; The whole suites thing forces our products to be on the same technology platforms whenever possible.</p>
<p>Anyway, here is what you need to know as a programmer.&#0160; .NET 2 through 3.5 used the same CLR (common language runtime), which meant that they were very compatible.&#0160; However .NET 4 uses a new CLR, which means that there are now compatibility issues between .NET 4 and older .NET versions.&#0160; For example, a .NET 3.5 app cannot load a 4.0 assembly.</p>
<p>If you are working with a 3.5 app and want to communicate with Vault 2013 server, you have a few options.&#0160; One option is to use the 2012 version of Autodesk.Connectivity.WebServices, which will have 16 as the version number.&#0160; Those DLLs will still be able to communicate with the 2013 server.&#0160; The downside is that you will not have the newest features, such as custom entities.&#0160; Another option is to use the Autodesk.Connectivity.WebServices from the SharePoint 2010 integration.&#0160; Because SharePoint 2010 uses .NET 3.5, we had to create a special DLL for it.&#0160; You can get this DLL from ADN, however we do not provide official support for it.</p>
<p>Other aspects of .NET 4:</p>
<ul>
<li>Visual Studio 2010 or higher must be used</li>
<li>Any project referencing a Vault API assembly must be .NET 4</li>
<li>.NET 4 framework must be installed on computers running the app.&#0160; The Vault installers definitely do this step during their install, and I think most other Autodesk installers do too.</li>
<li>If you are writing an extension to Vault, such as a custom command, you can load in older version assemblies.&#0160; However it’s recommended to use .NET 4 whenever possible.</li>
</ul>
