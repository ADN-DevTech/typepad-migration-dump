<p><strong>Update:</strong> For Vault 2013, we moved over to .NET 4.&#0160; See <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2012/05/net-4.html" target="_self">this post</a> for more details.&#0160; The rest of this article refers to Vault 2012.</p>
<p>We don&#39;t support .NET 4.0 extensions for Vault Explorer or Job Processor.&#0160; The problem is that Vault Explorer and Job Processor are 3.5 applications.&#0160; And a 3.5 application cannot load a 4.0 DLL.&#0160; In these cases, you will usually see an error message like, <em>&quot;Could not load file or assembly &#39;Foo&#39; or one of its dependencies. The system cannot find the file specified.&quot;</em></p>
<p>To fix, you need to switch your compile settings to .NET 3.5 or earlier.&#0160;</p>
<p>To change the settings is a VS 2010 C# project, go to the Application tab in your project settings and change the Target Framework.   <br /><img alt="" src="/assets/CSharp-scaled.png" /></p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>To change the settings is a VS 2010 VB.NET project, go to the Compile tab in your project settings and click the Advanced Compile Options button.&#0160; In the dialog that pops-up, change the Target framework.     <br /><img alt="" src="/assets/VB1.png" /></p>
