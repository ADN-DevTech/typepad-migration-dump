<p><img src="/assets/TipsAndTricks2.png" /> </p> <p>Over the years people have asked me for class diagrams of the Vault API.&#0160; I avoided doing them mainly because I don&#39;t have time.</p> <p>Recently, I&#39;ve started playing around with Visual Studio 2010, and I found that it can auto generate some pretty good diagrams.&#0160; So now I have no excuse.&#0160; Here are the class diagrams for the Vault API.&#0160; The only thing missing are the service classes from the Web Service API.&#0160; The diagram would have been incomprehensible if I left them in.</p> <p><a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/Files/ClassDiagrams/Vault2011/WebServices-NoServiceClasses.pdf" target="_blank">Web Service API diagram</a>  <br /><a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/Files/ClassDiagrams/Vault2011/ClientAPI.pdf" target="_blank">Client API diagram</a>  <br /><a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/Files/ClassDiagrams/Vault2011/JobProcessor.pdf" target="_blank">Job Processor API diagram</a></p> <p>I don&#39;t like how enums get a self reference, but everything else looks accurate.</p>
