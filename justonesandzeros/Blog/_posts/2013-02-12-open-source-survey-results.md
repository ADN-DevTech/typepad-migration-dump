<p>Thanks to everyone who took the time to take <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2013/02/maintaining-apps-through-open-source.html">the survey</a>.&#0160; Here are the results.</p>
<p>As expected, most people are in favor of open source.&#0160; A lot of people said they would contribute, and the numbers are good when you total it up.&#0160; As I stated before, Autodesk doesn’t have a good policy for this sort of thing, so nothing is certain.&#0160; But, this survey gives me enough to put together a proposal.&#0160; Thanks again.</p>

Total time for testing of apps (hours/month): 54  <br />Total time for developing apps (hours/month):&#0160; 33
<p>From the comments section:</p>
<p><em>Would we be able to contribute our own apps/utilities ? Or will it be purely tools created by yourself ?     <br /></em>[Doug] No.&#0160; Since the Autodesk policy is vague, I’m going to stick to the safe answer.&#0160; Maybe down the road, this can change.    <br />Of course, if you get stuck there are various ways you can get help, such as ADN or the Vault Customization discussion group.</p>
