<p>Autodesk Vault 2023 Clients introduced an updated themed user interface. As a user, I can select the <strong>Light</strong> (default install), <strong>Dark</strong>, or the legacy <strong>Classic</strong> theme for Vault Explorer. The CAD addins, like Vault for AutoCAD or Inventor, adopt the parent application&#39;s theme, Dark or Light. <a class="asset-img-link" href="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/.a/6a0120a5728249970b02b7519d5f28200c-pi" style="float: right;"><img alt="New File Dialog Themed 2023.2" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0120a5728249970b02b7519d5f28200c img-responsive" src="/assets/image_61d711.jpg" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" title="New File Dialog Themed 2023.2" /></a><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/.a/6a0120a5728249970b02b685302e53200d-pi"></a></p>
<p>Vault Data Standard (VDS) fully supports themes starting with the 2023 Update 2 as a minimum release version. The default configuration of Update 2 renewed all dialogs and data sheets.</p>
<p>Now - there is the question, how can your customized VDS configuration benefit from these new capabilities? Unfortunately, this question is rarely asked :(. Instead, I see forum posts, support requests, and emails asking, <em>&quot;We updated to Vault Professional 2023, and now all Data Standard dialogs are broken!&quot;&#0160;</em></p>
<p>If your <em><strong>custom</strong></em> dialogs (migrated from earlier Vault releases) miss the title bar, pull-down menus, or even more, you must update the style section of yo<a class="asset-img-link" href="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/.a/6a0120a5728249970b02b685302f83200d-pi" style="float: right;"><img alt="VDS Migration 2023.2 - Addendum Themes" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0120a5728249970b02b685302f83200d img-responsive" src="/assets/image_2958f9.jpg" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" title="VDS Migration 2023.2 - Addendum Themes" /></a>ur dialogs and data sheets. Acknowledged - this is unexpected work. But I can guarantee that you will like the result and the simplification if you have tried before to make your dialogs stylish.</p>
<p>I put together step-by-step instructions on updating your customized files: <a href="https://autode.sk/3IsdG1T" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Autodesk Vault Data Standard 2023 - Updates and Migration</a>. If you are familiar with VDS but less with &quot;Themes&quot; and &quot;Styles,&quot; start reading the crash course first. Experienced configuration administrators will benefit from tips, deriving themed messaging, and more. <a class="asset-img-link" href="https://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/.a/6a0120a5728249970b02b7519d6097200c-pi"><img alt="Themed Messaging" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0120a5728249970b02b7519d6097200c img-responsive" src="/assets/image_b2f211.jpg" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Themed Messaging" /></a></p>
<p>I hope you enjoy it!</p>
