<p>If you just got a Vault Collaboration tattoo, I’ve got bad news for you.&#0160; The product is no longer there in the 2014 release.&#0160; The 2014 product line consists of only Vault Basic, Workgroup and Professional.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="/assets/tattoo_scaled.jpg" />    <br /><span style="color: #888888;"><em>Oh well, at least my Google Reader tattoo will never go out of style.</em></span></p>
<p>I will be focusing on the technical content, like I always do.&#0160; If you have questions about pricing, support and migration, see your reseller.&#0160; My understanding is that things have been adjusted to make the Collab-&gt;Pro transition as smooth as possible for existing customers.</p>
<p><strong>Feature set</strong></p>
<p>There has been no impact on the product feature sets.&#0160; Vault Basic, Workgroup and Professional still have all the features they did from before.&#0160; Items and Change Orders can be hidden in Vault Pro if you are not interested in those features.</p>
<p><strong>Impact on the API</strong></p>
<p>There are some spots in the API that still reference Vault Collaboration.&#0160; The decision to remove the product was made after the API was locked down.&#0160; The Vault Collab stuff should not affect the API; it should just be dormant code.&#0160; If you experience any issues, let us know.</p>
<p><strong>Custom Objects all around</strong></p>
<p>My biggest problem with Vault Collaboration was that A) it didn’t have custom objects, and B) the AEC community was encouraged to use that product.&#0160; As a result, the AEC customers did not have custom objects, which is one of the most powerful tools for Vault customization.</p>
<p>With Vault Collab gone, AEC customers are being moved to Vault Professional.&#0160; That means your apps can use custom objects all you want without alienating any industry group.</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>That’s all I have on this topic.&#0160; It’s pretty straightforward.&#0160; Now if you’ll excuse me, I have an appointment at the laser center.</p>
