<p><strong>Update:</strong>&#0160; I fixed the Watch Folder video.&#0160; The original video had some errors during the last 10 minutes.</p>
<p>Here are all the videos from the webinar series that I have been running for the past 3 weeks.&#0160; Also included is the Source Code walkthrough from the Recycle Bin, which was cut for time reasons.</p>
