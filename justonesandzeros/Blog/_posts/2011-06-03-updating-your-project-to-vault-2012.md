<p>I don&#39;t believe it&#39;s hard to update your code to the Vault 2012API, but it&#39;s something that needs to be done.&#0160; And in this day and age, if it&#39;s worth doing, it&#39;s worth making a video and posting it online.&#0160; So here it is, a video of me updating a Vault 2011 application to the Vault 2012 API.&#0160;</p>

<p>NOTE:&#0160; The app in the video is Effective Folder Permissions, which I was planning on updating myself.&#0160; However someone else beat me to it, so the code in the video is not the code used by <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2011/05/effective-folder-permissions-3.html" target="_blank">Effective Folder Permissions 3</a>.</p>
