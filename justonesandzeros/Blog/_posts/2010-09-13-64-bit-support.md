<p><img src="/assets/Concepts2.png" /> </p> <p>Um... there is no 64-bit support if you are running inside Vault Explorer or Job Processor.&#0160; Those applications are built as 32-bit, which means any plug-ins are also 32-bit.&#0160; </p> <p>If you are writing a stand-alone application, then you can control how your app is built.&#0160; The default mode for .NET is to decide at runtime if it&#39;s 32-bit or 64-bit.&#0160; As long as you stay entirely in .NET, your code should work fine in either mode with no extra work on your part.&#0160; The problems come if you try to interface with non-.NET libraries, such as COM.&#0160;&#0160; </p> <p>The best advice I can give is to never assume anything about what mode you are running in.&#0160; Just because you are on a 64-bit machine does not mean the program is running as 64-bit, and just because the program is in Program Files (x86) doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s 32-bit.&#0160; In fact, don&#39;t even trust the first paragraph of this article.</p> <p>So what can you trust?&#0160; The answer is System.IntPtr.Size.&#0160; You can check this value at runtime to know for sure what mode you are running in.&#0160; From there you can write the appropriate logic, throw errors, etc.</p> <p>Autodesk.Connectivity.WebServices.dll is a pure .NET DLL, so it will work fine in either mode.</p>
