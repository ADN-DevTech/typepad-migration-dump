<p>Update:&#0160; <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2013/06/advanced-advanced-find-2014.html" target="_self">Click here for the 2014 version</a></p>
<p>Moving down the list of <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2012/09/survey-what-apps-should-i-update.html" target="_blank">apps to update</a>, Advanced Advanced Find is up next.&#0160; I’m a bit surprised.&#0160; The app really doesn’t do much despite the name.&#0160; I intended it more as a code sample.&#0160; But if you guys want it, you got it.&#0160; Here is the 2013 version of Advanced Advanced Find.</p>
<p>If you are not familiar with the app, it’s a simplified version of the Advanced Find feature, but it allows for OR style searches.&#0160; The Must rule is the default AND behavior.&#0160; The May rule gives you new OR style behavior.</p>

<p>Again, I didn’t have much time to add features.&#0160; There is now support for Folder and Custom Object searches, but that’s it.</p>
<p><strong>Requirements:</strong>    <br />Vault Workgroup/Collaboration/Professional 2013</p>
