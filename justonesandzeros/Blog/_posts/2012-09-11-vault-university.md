<p>I’m once again thankful to be going to <a href="http://au.autodesk.com/" target="_blank">Autodesk University</a> this year.&#0160; I’m always impressed by how much I learn.&#0160; Officially, my job is to teach the Vault API and represent Autodesk.&#0160; But I always come back with new perspectives and new ideas.&#0160; For example, the vLogic and DECO apps were a direct result from my experiences at AU 2011.&#0160; <a href="https://www.autodeskuniversity2012.com/portal/newreg.ww" target="_blank">Registration</a> is open now, so I hope to see you there.</p>

<p>For those interested in the Vault API, there 4 classes that you may be interested in.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.autodeskuniversity2012.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=1962" target="_blank">CP1962 - Programming Custom Objects with the Autodesk® Vault API</a>     <br />In this class, I will focus on custom objects and how to program them through the API.&#0160; Come hungry, because this class is 100% meat.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.autodeskuniversity2012.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=1963" target="_blank">CP1963 - Programming Integrations Between Autodesk® Vault and Other Systems</a>     <br />I’ll be going over various patterns for integrating Vault with other systems.&#0160; The SharePoint 2010 and PLM 360 integrations will be used as case studies.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.autodeskuniversity2012.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=1970" target="_blank">CP1970 - Empower Users with Custom Autodesk® Vault Explorer Extensions</a>     <br />Dan Leighton has a gift for explaining complex topics in a simple way.&#0160; If it’s anything like his Vault class from last year, you can expect emphasis on real-world solutions to real-world problems.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.autodeskuniversity2012.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=2641" target="_blank">CP2641 - PDF, Email Notification, Print, and More with Autodesk® Vault Job Processor via powerJobs</a>     <br />My friends from coolOrange will be showing off their awesome powerJobs application.&#0160; Although powerJobs provides functionailty out-of-the-box it’s also highly configurable, allowing you to hook to the Vault API thorough PowerShell.</p>
