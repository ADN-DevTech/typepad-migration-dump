<p>It&#39;s been a while, but I have a new spotlight feature for everyone.&#0160; This one is called <strong>NXTdim PDM</strong>, and it comes to us from <strong>Cadac Group</strong>.</p>

<p>From the creators:    <br /><em>Expand your Vault Job Server capabilities with two major Jobs Types:</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Secondary Documents</strong> - Automatically create several types of export files and add them as Secondary Documents (attachment) to your vaulted Inventor files. The Job can create all the export types you need in one go. You can make your own configuration for every Inventor Document Type and enforce the setting for all Vault Clients.</em></p>

<p><em><strong>Publish to SharePoint</strong> - Publish your Secondary Documents to one or more SharePoint Libraries. Each export file type of every Inventor document type can be uploaded to the SharePoint Library you want. You can even control the filename of the uploaded document and make mappings between iProperties and SharePoint Library Properties. Besides automatically queuing of the job on status change, there is an option to perform manual uploads as well.</em></p>
