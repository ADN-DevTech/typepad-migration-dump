<p>Hello everyone, my name is Paul Gunn.</p>
<p>I&#39;m a software architect on Vault and recently taught a class on the Vault 2019 API at Autodesk University 2018. Doug attended my class and graciously offered the opportunity to share this information with you as a guest blogger.</p>
<p>My class delved into new server APIs that provide (what we believe to be) new and powerful capabilities to developers. Here at Autodesk we have implemented a major client-side feature on this platform and other features in the pipe are similarly leveraging this functionality. The class downloads section includes the class handout and demo application (&#39;material&#39; zip file) - and a recording of the class is also available.</p>
<p>Here are resources available online:</p>

<p>Hope folks find this information useful!</p>
