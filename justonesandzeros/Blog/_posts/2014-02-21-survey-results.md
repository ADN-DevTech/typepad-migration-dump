<p>Thanks again to everybody who took the time to fill out the survey.&#0160; Here are the <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/images/2014/Survey2014/results.png" target="_blank">results</a> (out of 42 responses).&#0160;</p>
<p>Although I threw out the idea of a separate blog for PLM 360, I have no immediate plans to create a new blog.&#0160; That would require double the work, so I would need to find another blogger.&#0160;</p>
