<p>Although the Vault Mirror source code is still part of the Vault 2013 SDK, the compiled application is now a free download the <a href="http://apps.exchange.autodesk.com/VLTC/Home/Index" target="_blank">Vault App Store</a>.&#0160; Which brings me to my next point.</p>
<p><strong>We now have a Vault App Store!!!</strong>&#0160; There is not much up there now, but one day it may be as big as iTunes.&#0160; (I can dream, can’t I?)</p>
<p>Anyway, be sure to check it out periodically for new apps.&#0160; If you want to make some extra money writing your own apps, see the <a href="http://adn.autodesk.com/adn/servlet/item?siteID=4814862&amp;id=16302231&amp;linkID=4900509" target="_blank">Autodesk Developer Network</a> for more information.</p>
<p>I’ll still be posting apps to this blog too.&#0160; The difference being that apps in the store are high quality, and apps on this blog are experimental.</p>
<p>If you are still reading by this point, you shouldn’t.&#0160; You should be checking things out over at the <a href="http://apps.exchange.autodesk.com/VLTC/Home/Index" target="_blank">Vault App Store</a>.&#0160; So I’ll be quiet now and leave you to it.</p>
