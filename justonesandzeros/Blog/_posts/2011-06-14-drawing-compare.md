<p><strong>Update</strong>:&#0160; The 2013 version is available from the <a href="http://apps.exchange.autodesk.com/VLTC/Home/Index" target="_self">Vault App Store</a>.</p>
<p>Design Review has this cool feature where you can compare drawings.&#0160; Through the magic of API programming, Jan Liska from Autodesk Consulting has hooked this functionality to Vault.&#0160; The tool is called Drawing Compare and it easily lets you compare two drawings or two versions or revisions of a drawing from within Vault.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
