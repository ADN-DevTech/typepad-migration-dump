<p>My <strong>Getting Started with Autodesk Vault Programming</strong> videos are now live on <a href="http://au.autodesk.com/?nd=auv2011_player" target="_blank">AU Virtual</a>.&#0160; If you have an AU pass, you can now watch these videos on the AU website.&#0160; If not, you can <a href="http://au.autodesk.com/?nd=auv2011_event" target="_blank">sign up to AU Virtual for free</a>.</p>
<p>There is 90 minutes of content, spread across two 45-minute videos.&#0160; The videos contain not 1, not 2, not even 3, but <strong>4 complete programming demonstrations</strong>!&#0160; Each demonstration illustrates a different aspect of the Vault API.&#0160; I start with a new Visual Studio project and go through all the steps in writing, deploying and running the application. You can even follow along in your own development environment if you want.</p>
<p>For the AU event itself, I have a <a href="http://au.autodesk.com/?nd=event_class&amp;session_id=9305&amp;jid=1750118" target="_blank">lecture class</a> which will be a deep dive into the events feature in the 2012 API.</p>
