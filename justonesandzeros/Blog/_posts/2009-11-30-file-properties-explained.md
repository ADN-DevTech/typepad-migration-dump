<p><img src="/assets/Concepts2.png" /> </p> <p>The way Vault handles file properties is… interesting.&#0160; There are good reasons for the way things work, but the mechanics aren&#39;t very apparent and first.&#0160; So let me take some time to go over the concept of File properties.</p> <p><strong>Properties that Live Inside the File</strong></p> <p>Let&#39;s start out with the basics.&#0160; We&#39;ll take a look at a file on disk, no involvement with Vault.&#0160; This file probably has properties inside of it.&#0160; If it&#39;s a CAD file it has things like Part Number and Author.&#0160; The arrangement of these properties may be different for different file types, but the concept is the same:&#0160; <em>name / value pairs within the file</em>.</p> <p><img src="/assets/FileOnDisk.png" />   </p> <p><strong>Adding to Vault</strong></p> <p>Now let&#39;s add that file to Vault.&#0160; What happens on the server side is that Vault extracts the properties from the file and stores it in the database.&#0160; There are still properties inside the file, of course.&#0160; Vault stores a perfect copy of the file on its server.</p> <p><img src="/assets/FileInVault.png" /> </p> <p>Vault doesn&#39;t deal with those properties inside the file, however.&#0160; It is much easier to work with the copies in the database.&#0160; This allows for quick retrieval and searching.&#0160; The API refers to these properties as <strong>Derived Properties</strong> because they are just copies from another source.&#0160; These types of properties cannot be edited since, again, they are meant to be a copy of the file&#39;s properties.&#0160; You need to check out the file, edit it, and check it back in in order to change this property value.</p> <p>The convention is to use the suffix (I), (A) or (*) in the display name for these types.&#0160; They stand for Inventor, AutoCAD and &quot;other&quot; respectively.</p> <p><strong>System Properties</strong></p> <p>The Vault system automatically adds another set of properties related to Vault data, such as the check-in time and who added the file to Vault.&#0160; The API refers to these types as <strong>System Properties</strong>.&#0160; Again these property values cannot be edited directly since the Vault system assigns these values.</p> <p><img src="/assets/SystemProperties.png" />   <br />  <br />  </p> <p><strong>User Defined Properties</strong></p> <p>This type does not show up in base Vault.&#0160; All other versions have property types that allow the value to be directly edited.&#0160; These are usually called user defined properties or UDPs.&#0160; However the API calls these <strong>Custom</strong> properties.&#0160; This is the only type that allows values to be edited.&#0160; It&#39;s also the only type that allows property definitions to be added or edited or deleted.&#0160; </p> <p><img src="/assets/UDP1.png" /> </p> <p>It&#39;s possible to map a custom property to a derived property.&#0160; There are various uses for these maps.&#0160; For example, you can assign a value to a custom property then perform a writeback operation, which creates a new version of the file with the updated property value.</p> <p><img src="/assets/UDP2.png" />   </p> <p><strong>Moving Forward</strong></p> <p>This is just a first look at file properties.&#0160; I&#39;ll be going into more detail in future postings.&#0160; If there is something specific you want me to go over, let me know in the comments section below.</p>
