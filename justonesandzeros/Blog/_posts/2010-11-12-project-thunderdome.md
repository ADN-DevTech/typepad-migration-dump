<p>Wouldn&#39;t it be nice to push Vault settings out to all the Vault users?&#0160; Saved searches, for example.&#0160; Or maybe a plug-in from your favorite Vault API blog.&#0160; If there was only some sort of centralized document repository that you could use to deploy these files from.</p>
<p>Oh wait, Vault is a centralized document repository.&#0160; Let&#39;s use it to push data out to clients....    <br /><img alt="" src="/assets/UpdatesFound.png" /></p>
<p><strong>Overview:      <br /></strong>Welcome to Project Thunderdome, my attempt to make local Vault settings into global Vault settings.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s start with the <strong>Users Folder</strong> concept, which Thunderdome sets up.&#0160; It works the same as with Windows, each user can get their own folder that only they have access to.&#0160; There is also a <strong>Default Folder</strong> which all users can read from.<img alt="" src="/assets/UsersFolder-normal.png" /></p>
<p>The Administrator can place data in the Default Folder to have it pushed out to everyone with Project Thunderdome installed.&#0160; This can be used to push out just about any client setting (saved searches, grid state, shortcuts, etc) and other Vault Explorer extensions (<a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2010/05/watch-folder.html" target="_blank">Watch Folder</a>, <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2010/03/set-revision-iproperties.html" target="_blank">Set Revision iProperties</a>, etc).<img alt="" src="/assets/UsersFolder-admin.png" /></p>
<p>And just for fun, I added a command that will let a user back up their Vault settings to their user folder in Vault.    <br /><img alt="" src="/assets/backupCommand.png" />&#0160;</p>

<p><strong>Beyond Thunderdome:</strong><strong> <br /></strong>I can see a bunch of uses for the &quot;Users Folder&quot; concept.&#0160; I&#39;m sure I will re-visit it in future sample apps.&#0160; You&#39;re also free to expand upon the concept however you see fit.&#0160; Let me know what you think.</p>
