<p>Today my blog turns 6, which is 110 years is binary.&#0160; To celebrate, I’m going to reveal a couple of Easter Eggs that I’ve slipped in over the years.&#0160; Specifically, the titles of some of my apps.&#0160; One thing I love about writing my own apps is that I get to pick the name.&#0160; An in two cases, I named the app in such a way as to set up a joke.&#0160; That’s just the type of guy I am.</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p><strong>Project Thunderdome:</strong></p>
<p>Yes, it’s part of a movie title, but the joke goes deeper than that.&#0160; It’s probably best explained by this Mystery Science Theater 300 clip.&#0160; By the way, I’m a huge MST3K fan.</p>

<p>&#0160;</p>
<p><strong>The TTP Project:</strong></p>
<p>This app never achieved the popularity of Thunderdome, which is a shame.&#0160; I wanted to unload this joke on more people.&#0160; Basically the conversation would go like this.</p>
<p>(me an you chatting about PLM API programming) <br />Me: … You should check out my sample app, The TTP Project? <br />You: What does TTP stand for? <br />Me: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">T</span>he <span style="text-decoration: underline;">T</span>TP <span style="text-decoration: underline;">P</span>roject</p>
<p>Again, I stole this joke from <a href="http://dilbert.com/strip/1994-05-18">another source</a>.&#0160; Because that’s also the type of guy I am.</p>
