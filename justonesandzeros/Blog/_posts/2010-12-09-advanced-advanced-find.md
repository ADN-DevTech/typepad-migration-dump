<p>Update:&#0160; <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2012/10/advanced-advanced-find-2013.html" target="_self">Click here for the 2013 version</a>.&#0160; Sorry, there is no 2012 version.</p>
<p>Sometimes the Advanced Find feature in Vault is not enough.&#0160; You need something more advanced, specifically something that supports OR style searches.&#0160; With that in mind, I created the <em>Advanced</em> Advanced Find dialog.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="/assets/AdvancedAdvancedFind.png" /></p>
<p><strong>Overview:     <br /></strong>The dialog works similar to the Advanced tab in the regular Find dialog.&#0160; However there is one new thing, the Rule parameter.&#0160; This can be either Must or May.&#0160; Must is the default behavior and means that the search condition must be met in order for the object to show up in the search results.&#0160; The May option means that an object will show up&#0160; if it satisfies at least 1 of the conditions.&#0160;</p>
<p><strong>Requirements:</strong> <br />Vault Workgroup/Collaboration/Professional 2011</p>

<p><strong>Author&#39;s Note:     <br /></strong>Yes, I know that the standard Find dialog does many things that my dialog doesn&#39;t (saved searches, reports, that animated hourglass icon, etc), but &quot;Find Dialog That Is Advanced In One Specific Way&quot; was too long of a title.</p>
