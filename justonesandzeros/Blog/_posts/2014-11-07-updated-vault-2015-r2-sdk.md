<p>Many of you doing development on Vault 2015 R2 have noticed some issues with the SDK.&#0160; For example, the What’s New page is for the 2015 release and there is no list of changes for 2015 R2.</p>
<p>Those issues should now be fixed.&#0160; Sorry for the inconvenience.&#0160; Please un-install your current Vault 2015 R2 SDK and install the fixed SDK: <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/Files/Vault_2015_R2_SDK-Fixed.zip">Vault_2015_R2_SDK-Fixed.zip</a></p>
<p>If you have questions about the Vault API, the best place to go is the <a href="http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/vault-customization/bd-p/301" target="_blank">Vault Customization discussion group</a>.</p>
