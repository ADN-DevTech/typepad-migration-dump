<p>Technically it’s called the VaultBrowserControl, but everyone refers to it as <strong>The</strong> <strong>Grid Control</strong>.&#0160; Sure, you can build other grid controls, but there is no point.&#0160; The Grid Control does everything you want.&#0160; The version in the VDF is actually an <em>improved</em> version over the main grid in the Vault Explorer client.&#0160; </p>
<p>I can’t do justice to all the features of this control, so I bought in the developer lead on the VDF.&#0160; Please give a warm internet welcome to Michael Foster.</p>

<p>If you liked this video, please let us know in the comments section.&#0160; I think I can get Michael to provide more content if we give him enough encouragement.</p>
