  body: 'Hey, this goes along the subject of Properties...


    I''m using the method ''GetPropertyDefinitions'' out of the IPropertyManager interface,
    and I''ve found an issue...


    There are 3 parameters for this method:  Entity Class Filter, Entity Category
    Filter, and Property Definition Filter.


    The issues is this:  if I use the 1st and last parameters and leave the middle
    as Nothing I can get all UserDefined Properties, for say, a Folder, but the moment
    I put an Entity Category in the middle, I either get NO results, or if I null
    the 1st param, I get ALL user defined properties.  Even though in the documentation
    it says that it retrieves ONLY the properties for that category.


    The reason this would be great is I''m programming some things to apply property
    values early, and I''d like to pull all User Properties according to category.  Right
    now I''ve been using a separate database, that I have to REMEMBER to update.  But
    I''ve rambled enough, maybe we could email or something.  I can show you what
    I''ve been working on.


    Thanks, I really enjoy your site, it is VERY informative.
