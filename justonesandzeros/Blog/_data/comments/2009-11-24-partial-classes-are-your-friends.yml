    May I ask two questions about this:


    First: If I would create a partial class for your DocumentService as you show
    in your blog, could it be locally or would it need to be put on the server? Can
    it even be compiled without the server part?


    Second: The server error 300: is this just referring to 2010 or was that a feature
    of previous versions (such as PS 2008), too?


    Thanks!


    - Tobias'

  body: 'To answer your first question: The DocumentService class doesn''t exist on
    the server.  The class is auto-generated by Visual Studio when you create the
    web reference.  So this is a client change.  Nothing gets done to the server.


    To answer your second question:  Yes, error 300 and the posted work around applies
    to PS 2008.  The 2008 release was the first to expire security headers, so this
    is not an issue for Vault/PS 5 and earlier.'
