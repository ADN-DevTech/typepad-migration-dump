  body: "Hi, nice post, but I have a problem with this function, I not sure if I understand\
    \ correct this function.\n\nThe argument parentIds what parrent refer, the entity\
    \ were the link lives or the file parent, \n\nfor instance I have entity person,\
    \ and cars, so the entity person have links to cars, for instance\n\nPerson 1\
    \ (lnk_car1, lnk_Car2, lnk_car3)\nPerson 2 (lnk_car3, lnk_car4)\n\nLike you see\
    \ person 1 and 2 share a car.\n\nOk, need to run a search to get all blue car,\
    \ (all files represented the image(jpg) of a car an have a custom property color)\n\
    \nBut need to run this search to only get car for the person 1, soy I suppose\
    \ parentId is the person 1 id? then the serach only search for links inside person\
    \ 1?\n\nIf I test this, I get a 1000 error code\n\ncan you give me some light\
    \ here?\n\nthanks,\n\n\n\n-----"
