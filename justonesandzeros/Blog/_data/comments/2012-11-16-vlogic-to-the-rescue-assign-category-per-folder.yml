    This step will cause an error to be thrown when exporting the vault configuration
    from the ADMS console:


    "Set up File and Folder categories with matching names for cases where you want
    the script to run.  This step is needed because categories can’t be shared across
    Files and Folders."


    Its a bug within the database I believe, once that is fixed then there will be
    nothing wrong with this approach. Bloody good work otherwise, Cheers.


    Scott'

  body: 'Maybe you could change your code to look for the same names between the two,
    but the folder rule could use F_ as a prefix or something to maintain unique category
    naming?


    The bug should be fixed of course, but this would be a semi-acceptable workaround.'

    it was fixed in Vault 2013.


    Anyway, the nice thing about scripts is that it''s easy to make changes.  To make
    your F_ change, just edit the PS1 file.  Find the part that says

    <b>Where-Object {$_.Name -eq $parentFolder.Cat.CatName}</b>

    And change it to

    <b>Where-Object {$_.Name -eq "F_" + $parentFolder.Cat.CatName}</b>

    -----'
