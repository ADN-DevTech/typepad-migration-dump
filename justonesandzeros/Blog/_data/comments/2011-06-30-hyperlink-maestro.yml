  body: No you can't modify the export function.  However, if you are a programmer,
    you can write a tool that edits the .csv file once it's written.

  body: 'Can''t find info about format of links to ojects (ex.Items) in webclient.

    Let say we do know name of server, name of vault and Item Number. is it enough
    to generate direct url?

    I see the way to gnerate search based url

    <a href="http://SERVER_NAME/AutodeskDM/webclient/AdvancedSearchForm.aspx?SearchType=items&SearchText=ITEM_NUMBER">http://SERVER_NAME/AutodeskDM/webclient/AdvancedSearchForm.aspx?SearchType=items&SearchText=ITEM_NUMBER</a>

    but to use it user should choose the particular vault manually.

    Is there any better name?'

    Is there a version of this that works with 2013?  Specifically we are looking
    for a way to link a watermarked ITEM to our ERP Inventory system.  We want anyone
    searching a part number to see the Item in Vault in whatever it''s current lifecycle
    state is.'

    B. Links are not suitable for long-term storage.  Have a look at my article on
    persistent IDs.  <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2013/08/persistent-ids.html">http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2013/08/persistent-ids.html</a>
