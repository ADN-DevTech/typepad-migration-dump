    Is it possible to link a custom object to a report to get a printout?

    Also, you currently cannot generate a report from custom object data.'

    I''ve just managed to create a report from the Custom Object data.


    It only works if a search is done on the custom object. I''m guessing it them
    grabs all properties from the form.


    If I try to generate a report directly on the custom object, it doesn''t populate.

    If I have a grid with text fields on that grid. Can I place a scroll viewer in
    the project and merge the grid?

  body: 'Hi Doug


    I''ve found the data from vault populates in a drop down list for a combo box
    automatically if there is a list setup in vault.


    I do have a problem though. It seems that it only selects the list items added
    in vault. I have selected IsEditable in the xaml combo box?


    When inputting the data manually in the deco form it doesnt update.


    Any help would be great.


    Thanks

    I installed and created my first UI. I basically recreated the Tasks you showed
    in your 2013 video. I am having a problem linking my UI to the custom object.


    when I go into Deco, configure menu, I add the name of the xaml file. Restart
    Vault Pro 2014, and then the xaml files do not get loaded. If I go back to the
    Configure menu, I''m still seeing default instead of the xaml name I added.


    Any idea why I cannot add my UIs?

    DECO has been a great tool for us. I have managed to create a number of custom

    Please keep me informed.


    Appreciate your efforts with this excellent attachment.


    Thanks Doug.'
