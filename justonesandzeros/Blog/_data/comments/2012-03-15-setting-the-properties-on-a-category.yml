  body: 'Hi,

    in the vault professional 2013 is it possible to have some properties cross referenced
    between project and files?

    I have some files linked a different project.

    For example the property X of the linked file 1 has the value AA in project AAA
    but the value BB in the project BBB.

    Thanks'
