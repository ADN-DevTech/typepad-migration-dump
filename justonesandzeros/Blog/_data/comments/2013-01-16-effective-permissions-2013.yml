  body: 'Great to hear you "patronize back" the util development and it get new functionality!

    It is the highly important util in extended Vault environments like our company
    has.

    I have couple questions regarding it:

    1. Was revoving radiobutton (groups/user) rewoved from Permissions overview deliberately?
    How to manage groups with it now?

    2. Click on cell in Overview window now generates no the expected dialog for making
    changes? Was it made deliberate?'

    <a href="http://vaultfolderpermis.codeplex.com/">http://vaultfolderpermis.codeplex.com/</a>


    The 2013 version is not based on the 2012 version.


    The version on codeplex was not written by me or anyone at Autodesk.  Since I
    work for Autodesk, I am very careful when using outside code.  Autodesk doesn''t
    have a well defined "open-source" code policy.  So the safe approach was to just
    stick to my code base.'

    I have discovered something more,  in the Effective Folder Permission,

    if users is member of a group and the group has premission on folder,

    the user is display as they have "no access".


    It could be nice to have a feature displaying in grid user and groups members
    like

    Folder Permission.
