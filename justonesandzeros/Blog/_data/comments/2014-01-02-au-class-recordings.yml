  body: 'Hi Doug,


    I am trying to use just the GridControl (DevExpress) itself (01:18:00 in the video).
    I used the sample which is shown in the PowerPoint, but the GridControl doesn''t
    seem to have a SetDataSource method. Is there a sample project available somewhere?'

  body: 'You can download the Additional Materials for some code samples.  Also, VaultBrowserSample
    in the SDK and the latest version of Advanced Advanced Find on this blog use the
    grid.


    FYI.  The DevExpress content is completely encapsulated by the Vault API.  You
    shouldn''t have to reference the DevExpress assemblies directly in your code.  So
    make sure you are using the GridControl from Autodesk.DataManagement.Client.Framework.Vault.Forms.dll.
