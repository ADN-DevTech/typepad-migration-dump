  body: 'This helped me out a lot! The item master doesn''t appear to honor the lifecycle
    transition action: "Sync properties and update view using Job Server". I assumed
    that the new lifecycle functionality for item’s would perform a property sync
    on associated files and put them in the job queue for DWF creation but that doesn’t
    appear to be the case so this gave me a good work around for now. Thanks again!
