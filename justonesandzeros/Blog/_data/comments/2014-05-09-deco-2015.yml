  body: Doug, do you know why Data Standard for 2014 was removed from the subscription
    center? It appears that only 2015 is available now.

  body: I'm not on the Vault team anymore, so I'm not updating any of my apps.  Hopefully,
    Data Standard can provide all the features you need.

  body: Not on Vault anymore - that's terrible news, we will miss you greatly Doug.
    Has someone replaced you, who is going to keep us informed and hold our hands
    when we have Vault coding problems?

  body: 'Thanks.  I miss Vault too.  I''m still at Autodesk, so you''ll probably see
    me around next time I have a product that I can blog about.


    Autodesk Developer Network fully supports Vault.  There is also a discussion group
    on Vault programming that''s run by the Vault development team.  <a href="http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/vault-customization/bd-p/301">http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/vault-customization/bd-p/301</a>


    So that part is covered.  The main thing missing is somebody to take over blogging
    and sample apps.  But I still prod the Vault team whenever I get a chance.
