  body: 'Quite useful. Thanks.

    Would be even more useful if couple options be added:

    - grid column sorting

    - result export to csv/xls

    - find orphan Items

    - find empty folders'

  body: The Vault Basic client doesn't support plug-ins.  So utilities like this are
    possible, but they would have to be written as a separate app.

  body: 'Doug, I''ve just payed attention that subfolders in Extensions folder where
    your add-ins are stored are all with lock signs on them.

    Think this is a reason why user that is not administrator got access error on
    attempt to start Vault Explorer (before Log in).

  body: 'I'' have forgotten to ask a question :)

    The question is: Why all just_ones&zeroes apps (except Drawing Compare) don''t
    allow users without admin rights to access corresponding Extensions folder and
    thus prevent Vault Explorer from start? Was it done deliberately?'

  body: 'No, it''s not done deliberately, and I have not been hearing other people
    having this problem.


    By default, users should be able to read from c:\programData.  My installers should
    not be setting any special permissions on the Extensions folders, so you would
    expect people to be able to read these extensions.


    Drawing Compare uses the same installer framework that all my other apps use.  I
    don''t see why it would behave differently.'
