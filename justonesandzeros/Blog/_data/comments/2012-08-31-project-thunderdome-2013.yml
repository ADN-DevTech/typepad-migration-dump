  body: 'Sorry but my first question is not about the projesct itself:

    The "My Checked Out Files" ... i don''t think there is any sense to give users
    a list of files checked out by administrator, right?

    Thus it is probably about some universal search that returns a list of files checked
    out by ACTIVE user, right.

    If so then you probably need to share how to set up such a search without using
    "Prompt for value" option, please.'

  body: 'Doh!

    The search does check for all files checked out by "Administrator".  It''s probably
    not something you would want to push out.  I wasn''t really focusing on that when
    I made the video.


    I don''t think there is a way to set up a saved search that searches for your
    checked out files without prompting or hard-coding a user name.'

    Great app but would be more usefull if the grid config settings would also apply
    to not just the main grid, but the History, Uses and Where used tab


    it doesnt appear to retain the custom columns for these tabs, any plans to include
    these as well?'

    Question: I see it supports no 3rd party apps, right?


    Let say I''d like all our users have "My checked out files" installed (not only
    installed but also configured to show a list of files checked-outed by user on
    his log-out). But Thunderdome doesn''t list the app in Plug-ins section while
    it lists "Watch folder".


    Doug is there anything me or you can do about it?'

    to avoid interference with the App Store.  For example, if somebody is charging
    $5 per download, they probably don''t want Thunderdome automatically deploying
    it.


    If an app wants to be recognized by Thunderdome, it needs to be signed with Thunderdome.snk,
    which is included with the source code.  See the readme for more details.'

    A. Ban users to spoil the saved searches "injected".

    B. What about client Updates (in Inventor we used to call them service packs)
    could updates be injected with PT?


    BTW, we are going to:

    1. Dub PT to office domestic language (all messages bi-lingual).

    2. Remove button "No and never ask me again". As alternative it worth to unistall
    Vault Explorer and close the access if the button is pressed (I as admin don''t
    want to privide any support to users that neglect my recommendations).'

    If you are building your own ''Dome, then B is definitely possible.  A will require
    some creativity, but it''s also doable.'

    I would like to see the ability to save the settings for the grid layout in the
