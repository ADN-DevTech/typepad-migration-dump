    I''d like to share an opinion that I''ve heard on recent regional forum devoted
    to CAD usage:

    "Autodesk creates great software but tells nobody about the fact".

    Your series of articles is great!

    Such articles may change the opinion. But may not change as well.

    Does Autodesk have in plan to develop some books or courseware on Vaults?

    There is the only book in store regarding Vault (regarding free Vault) but users
    need info about advanced Vaults.

    It is a problem. Isn''t it?'

    Yes, we are planning on updating the Vault courseware.  I''m not sure when it
    will be out or what the content will be, but I do know it is being worked on.  So
    even though we have blogs, discussion groups and wikis, we haven''t turned our
    backs on the popular "book" format.'

    I understand for Autocad files that you have to go to the server console and index
    the attribute block (by name) in order for it to appear as a property.  Do you
    also have to enable content indexing service for attribute block properties to
    work correctly?  We don''t run content indexing service, so I was wondering if
    that is why my attribute block properties still don''t work, even after indexing
    the attribute block and mapping it to the appropriate UDP.


    Thanks!'

    I am not 100% sure on that.  I suggest posting this issue on the Vault discussion
