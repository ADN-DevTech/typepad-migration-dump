  body: "Maybe.  It depends on you are trying to do.  \n\nWhen your command gets executed,\
    \ an object is passed in that lets you see what is selected in the 3 major Vault\
    \ Explorer panes.\n\nIn the case of the <b>preview pane</b>, you can see what\
    \ is selected, but not which tab is active.  And for Uses and Where Used, you\
    \ only get the label (filename) and not the ID.\n\nIt's still possible to get\
    \ that information however.  In the <b>view pane</b>, you can get the selected\
    \ file, along with the ID.  Next you would use that ID to find out the parent\
    \ or child associated files.\n\nI'm probably not making much sense.  It's hard\

    \ a bit to see what data gets pass in to your command event handler."

  body: 'I want to write a custom Job to move (copy) files from one folder to another
    (outside Vault), upon an event in vault.  Where can i start?

    Is there any sample code to get me started, where can i find it?  Haven''t written
    code in a long time, but need this functionality.

    What can you lead me?'

  body: 'Just to be clear, the only event that Vault 2011 can do is queue up a job
    on a file lifecycle change.  Hopefully this meets your requirements.


    The best place to start is with the SDK, which is installed to a folder called
    SDK under your Vault Server install directory.  You will want to focus on the
    Job Processor API, which is how you write a custom job handler.  There are also
    some samples in the SDK under the title JobProcessorApiSamples.


    My Watch Folder example from this blog also uses the Job Processor API, but it''s
    more dense than the SDK samples.


    I''m not sure what your programming background is, but you might want to start
    at <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com">http://msdn.microsoft.com</a> for general
    programming help.
