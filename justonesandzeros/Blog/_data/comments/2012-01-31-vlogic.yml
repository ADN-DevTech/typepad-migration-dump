    Question: I realise it''s very early days for this add in but are you planning
    on creating a library of common commands/samples for use with vLogic - in the
    same way that Inventor does within iLogic?

  body: 'I don''t have any plans at the moment.  I''m going to wait and see how things
    evolve.  Having a script library is a good idea.  My hope is that a bunch of people
    start writing scripts and trading them online.  Then I can just gather up the
    good ones into a power pack or something.
