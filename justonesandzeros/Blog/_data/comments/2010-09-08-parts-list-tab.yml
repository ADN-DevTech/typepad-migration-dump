  body: 'Hi Doug, is there a possibility to define which columns should be shown?

    That would round up the information to the most needed requests I heard in the
    field.

    It should be not to hard to implement this in the source code (I''m not the .NET
    specialist :-) )'

  body: 'Dear Sir, it''s possible to see in the table the items B, C, D, with ther
    quantity. I can do that with recursive sql query but I have serious problem to
    do that with vb.net and autodesk vault library.

    could you help me? Thanks Massimo'

  body: I think ItemService.GetItemBOMByItemIdAndDate is the function you want.  With
    this function you can get the entire BOM structure, which you can then use to
    calculate the quantity.

  body: 'Thanks for your answer,

    but with GetItemBOMByItemIdAndDate I get an array, after I have to implode the
    bom, the only way I know is to use a recursive sql query. So I have to create
    a stored procedure into sql and then call it in vb.net, but this is no easy way
    and autodesk don''t want the user modify directly the db. Any idea? Thanks Massimo'

  body: GetItemBOMByItemIdAndDate gives you back arrays of Items and arrays of Item
    Associations.  From those two things you can construct the BOM tree.  You can
    then recurse through the BOM tree to calculate the data you need.
