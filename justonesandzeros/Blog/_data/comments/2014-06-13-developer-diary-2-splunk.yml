  body: 'Great work and right direction, Doug!


    But can you clear some things:

    <ol>

    <li>Are you handling SOAP traffic in LOG files (for example, at 4:25)? And how
    did you do this if ''yes'' - customizing IIS logs, etc.?</li>

    <li>Or you just handling/parsing URL string?</li>

    <li>Can I see what did not-Vault-Explorer application do on server?</li>

    </ol>

    Regards, Dmitry'

  body: '1. No.  I''m not intercepting SOAP traffic.  I''m just reading from the log
    files.


    2. I''m just reading from the URL string.  Several of the Vault clients add extra
    data to the query string, and that is what I am reading out in Splunk.


    3. Query string data is not automatic.  The client has to explicitly add that
    data.  Vault Explorer and Inventor definitely add this data.  I am not sure about
    other Autodesk applications.


    Third-party apps are probably not setting the query string.  But if it''s a plug-in
    to Vault Explorer, I think the query string will be set.  I need to test.'

    This way user can work from third-party app and no operations won''t be recorded.


    As I know, IIS in ''debug'' mode can show the SOAP traffic. But IIS can''t log
    it in ''regular'' mode - only via certain customizations with programming. If
    you could solve this puzzle - that would be the most appropriate solution for
    any cases.'

    it will be useful for most of the Vault customers.
