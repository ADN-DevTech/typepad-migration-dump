  body: Correct, if the file is checked out to you, then you do not set the read-only
    attribute.

  body: "Hey Doug.. \n Took me days of agony & pain to realize it´s the same thing\
    \ on check-in / upload ( unless I ended up with a stupid hack )..  Maybe elaborate\
    \ a bit on this matter in a \"get started section\" to help us newbies on the\
    \ way.. It´s a very essential Vault concept : WHY the attributes are applied &\
    \ WHEN ( in the code/process ) they are applied..\n\nKeep up the good work! This\
    \ blog is a mindblowing!"

    future posts.

    Thanks.'

  body: 'At the time the article was written File.Locked didn''t do anything.  It
    was "reserved for future use".

    In the last couple releases of Vault, I think File.Lock has been enabled, but
    you should test it out for yourself to be sure.'

  body: 'I am trying to solve a problem I am having that seems to be related to this
    issue during uploading.  I have an Inventor addin that updates iProperties on
    all the referenced documents of an assembly.  We recently upgraded to Inventor
    2015 and I am updating the code to use the new Vault API VDF classes to acquire
    files.  I have everything ported to the new API but after checkin Vault is indicating
    that my local files are out of date, red dot in the Vault explorer.  I found your
    "Tips and Tricks" about setting the creation time of the local file to match the
    vault file but when I call SetCreationTime it throws an exception saying that
    the file is being used by another process.  This code was originally written for
    Inventor 2013 and I never had any problems with it until I updated it to the new
    API.  This code is an important part of our work flow as it takes what would be
    a 5 to 6 hour job and makes it 2 to 3 minutes.  Do you have any suggestions on
    how to resolve this problem?


    Thank you'

  body: 'The first step is to find out what is locking the file.  I don''t think it''s
    the Vault API.  Could it be Inventor that is locking the file?
