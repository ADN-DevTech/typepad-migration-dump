  body: 'I should have clarified that this integration with SharePoint 2010 has nothing
    to do with the existing "Publish to SharePoint" feature in Vault Explorer.


    Publish to SharePoint creates a copy of Vault files which gets uploaded to SharePoint.  The
    new BCS integration doesn''t copy anything.  It just provides a view into Vault
    data from the SharePoint UI.


    Anyway, the BCS component will not work with an externally hosted SharePoint,
    which has restrictions on third-party software.

    I''m not sure about the publish to SharePoint command.'

  body: 'I''m not sure what you are asking.  Are you saying that you want Federated
    Search to return the results as a SharePoint grid?

    That''s not possible.  The SharePoint search framework doesn''t work that way.


    The closest workaround is to use the "search" view on the vault lists.  When you
    modify the view one of the filter options is a search string.  This is useful
    if you want to run the same search over and over and display the results as a
    list.'

  body: I just had a demo of Vault from Autodesk and we currently use SharePoint 2010.
    The way they positioned the Vault product was as a replacement for SharePoint.
    Is this true?

  body: The Federated Search does not use BCS.  The search results are based on the
    Vault user that SharePoint uses to communicate with Vault.
