  body: 'Hi Doug,


    How bout this?  User name: administrator

    server: 127.0.0.1

    vault name: industrial machine (I''m using it for testing purposes, it''s the
    one Brian S. has used in his Vault classes) no special characters in the password
    - very simple actually, 1234abcd


    Any help you might share would be truly appreciated.


    Regards,


    Joe B.'

    Remove the gadget from your desktop.  Go to "%localappdata%\Microsoft\Windows
    Sidebar\Gadgets", delete VaultCO.Gadget, download it again and deploy it again.


    Let me know if that fixes it.'
