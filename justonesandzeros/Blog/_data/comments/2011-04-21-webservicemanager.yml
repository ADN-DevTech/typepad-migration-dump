  body: 'Yes, the service objects all use WSE 3.0.  However, you still need to enable
    MTOM by having a "microsoft.web.services3" section in the applications .config
    file.


    The following article explains how to update the .config file and test to make
    sure that binary transfer is working:

  body: Does this sign in method consume a Vault license at logon?

  body: 'The WebServiceManager supports all types of Vault logins.  The normal login
    will consume a license when the manager signs-in to the server, which is when
    new is called on WebServiceManager.


    If a read-only is used, as shown in my sample code, then WebServiceManager will
    not consume a license.  The last parameter on the UserPasswordCredentials constructor
    tells if the login will be read-only or not.
