  body: 'Hello Doug,


    I''m trying to use this tool to search Vault for a specific subset of our Inventor
    Drawings.  I''m getting hung up on just running the basic "Search" Sample Code.


    When I installed the vlogic application, the sample code worked.  Now I run the
    sample code, and I get the following:


    >>

    Error: Exception calling "GetProperLyDefinitionsByEntityClassId" with "1"

    argument(s): "279"


    Error: Exception calling "FindItemRevisionsBySearchConditions" with "5"

    argument(s): "The request failed with HTTP status 404: Not Found."

    >>


    It has to be something simple, but if you have seen this before, can you please
    help me out?


    Thanks a lot,

    David'

  body: 'My guess is that you are not connected to a Vault Professional server.  So
    searching on items will fail because items are only in Vault Pro.


    Error "279" means InvalidEntityClassName.  The "ITEM" type is only valid in Vault
    Pro.


    HTTP 404 means it can''t find the URL.  If it''s not Vault Pro, there will be
    no ItemService URL.
