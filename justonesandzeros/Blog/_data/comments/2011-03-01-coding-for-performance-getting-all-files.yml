  body: 'Doug,


    I have a application that needs to query my vault. If I know the local ( absolute
    ) folder and want to return a list of all the vault files in it to know what file
    names are in it.


    Is there a quick way of scoping the search condition to all files in a folder?


    Thx - NLD'

    pass in the Folder Id.  The search will only be applied to objects in that folder
    and any sub-folders.


    Going from a local folder on disk to a Vault folder is a bit tricky.  I think
    most people start at the root Vault folder, get the working folder (Connection.WorkingFoldersManager.GetWorkingFolder())
    and use that to map between local path and Vault path.  This only works if the
    sub-folders don''t define their own working folder in another location.'
