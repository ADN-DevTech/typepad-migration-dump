  body: 'In the Vault-Help (VDF - Vault Browser Control) is the talk of "Context Menu:
    The control provides a default set of entries based on where the user clicked."

    But when i implement the Grid i don''t get any Context-Menu. (do i have to enable
    it or something else?)

    Isn''t there a way to get the same Context-Menu i get in the Vault-Explorer.'

  body: 'You should be getting a context menu for a grid.  Try right-clicking in the
    whitespace.  The default menu will have things like "Customize columns".


    The default context menu is not the menu that Vault Explorer uses.  There is no
    way to use the context menu from Vault Explorer.
