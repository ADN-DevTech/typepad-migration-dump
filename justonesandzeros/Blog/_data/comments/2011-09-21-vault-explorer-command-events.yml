  body: It's part of the IExtension interface that you use for writing custom commands.  OnStartUp
    runs when Vault Explorer starts up.

  body: 'Above Copy Design sample is for old Copy Design. For new Copy Design, which
    is a modeless dialog, CommandEnd event will be fired once the dialog is shown.
    However, there is another Autodesk.DataManagement.Client.Framework.Vault.Forms.Library.CopyDesignDialogClosed
    event which is fired when new copy design dialog is closed. So it could be a replacement
    of the CommandEnd event here.
