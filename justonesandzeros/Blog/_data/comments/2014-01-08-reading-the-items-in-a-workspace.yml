  body: 'Hi Doug,


    I''ve been looking and looking for something similar to this.  Here is my dilemma.


    I want an app (fast and light would be great) that lists all the files on my computer
    in the Vault Workspace that ARE NOT in Vault.  (Deleted from Vault, not managed
    by vault, all of that.)


    I want to prevent anybody from cleaning out their local workspace folder blindly,
    assuming that they checked everything into Vault.  Sometimes you save a copy of
    an inventor file to test something out, or there may be CAM programs saved there,
    or PDF data sheets with information about a purchased part included in a design.  Some
    users (me included) forget to check these items into Vault, and they might get
    forgotten.


    Is there an app for that?  I was thinking about creating a custom one, and it
    seems like the items endpoint might be a good quick way to get all the files in
    the local workspace.  Am I way off?


    Sincerely,

    David Fletcher
