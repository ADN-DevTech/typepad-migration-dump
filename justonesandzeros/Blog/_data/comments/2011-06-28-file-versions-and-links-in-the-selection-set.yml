  body: 'First, you call GetFilesByMasterId to get the complete version history.  Next,
    you scan through the versions and pick a single version from each revision.  That
    will give you the revision history.


    There are 2 main ways to pick the version for a revision.  You could just pick
    the one with the highest version number.  Or you could do the "released biased"
    view where you pick the highest version in a released state.  If there is no released
    state, you just pick the highest version.


    Here is an article with some diagrams, which may of help.  <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2009/10/file-associations-part-2.html">http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2009/10/file-associations-part-2.html</a>
