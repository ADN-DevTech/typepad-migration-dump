  body: 'I have wanted such a functionality for a long time..

    Seems to work great on file revisions.


    But I just have to ask. Could you tweak a version to work with versions as well?
    (For comparing when not using revisions, and for comparing item revisions)'

    This feature work with only revisions scheme? If work with version too will be
    cool, is possible?

  body: I agree with the above, will be extremely handy for pre-release drawings.
    Management of pre-released files (including revision tables) is just as important
    as released ones.

  body: Works well except my additions and deletions show as red and a dashed square
    instead of red and green.  Are there options to control these?
