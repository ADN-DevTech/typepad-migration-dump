  body: 'Hi Doug.

    Is there any way to process only jobs logged by a certain user? If one of our
    engineers releases their document(s), we want to create a DWFx for the shop floor
    to view. Rather than have to process all other users releases, a particular engineer
    would want to process only their own files by running Job Processor locally, then
    check through to ensure updated details (such as revision) are correct on the
    DWFx.'

  body: 'It sounds like you just want to create the DWF locally.  In other words,
    you don''t care about the job queue itself, you just want to execute the DWF job
    handler?


    There is a trick you can do to execute a job handler without involving the job
    queue.  Basically, you load the handler DLL directly and pass it a fake job.  I
    think I''ll make this my next blog post, so stay tuned.


    To answer your original question, no, you can''t reserve jobs based on the user
    that queued the job.'

  body: so you have to go back and Re-submitt the jobs again ? or can you automate
    that process as well ? I get the same thing once its done and I try to restart
    to job processor it says it is already running ? and do I need to be worried about
    the files that have Error on them I seem to have allot of those that I have to
    resubmit to the job processor ?

  body: 'If you change the job processor settings, you shouldn''t have to re-submit
    any jobs.

    If jobs have errors, it means they were run and something went wrong.  The error
    usually has something to do with the operation (for example, Inventor crashed
    when trying to generate a the DWF). The job processor settings won''t cause job
    failures.'

  body: '" Next edit the copy in an XML editor and comment out all the <jobHandler>
    elemets where the class attribute starts with “Autodesk.Vault.DWF.Create”.  "
    I don''t understand what you mean with comment out... Delete the row (from the
    job/element) in the copy JobProcessor.exe.config?? Is that what you mean?


    I want to run some jobs not on the working day and run these jobs in the night.


    I''m looking forward for your answer!'

    You want to delete or comment <jobHandler> entries.  For example, if you want
    to disable DWF jobs for .iam files, your JobProcessor.exe.config would contain
    a line like this...

    <!-- <jobHandler class="Autodesk.Vault.DWF.Create.iam" handler="Connectivity.Explorer.JobHandlerDwfPublish.DwfJobHandler,
    Connectivity.Explorer.JobHandlerDwfPublish"/>  -->'

    No, you can''t delete jobs through a prompt.  You would need to write a custom
    app to delete that many jobs.
