  body: I'm not familiar with that behavior.  Is this with a custom job type or one
    of the default types?  It custom job types are being unreserved, I would consider
    that a bug.

  body: 'Hi Doug,


    Yes it is a custom job. But I found what is going on. It only happens when the
    Job Processor is also running. It unreserves all its own jobs. I worked around
    that by adding a suffix to the hostname as client name.
