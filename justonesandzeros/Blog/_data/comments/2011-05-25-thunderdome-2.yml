  body: 'Doug,


    I''m trying to set this up, but i get the following message when I try to backup
    my settings. <a href="http://screencast.com/t/ef6BICOMrjy">http://screencast.com/t/ef6BICOMrjy</a>


    Also if i backup my settings, as Administrator, and then try to copy those settings
    to the Default folder, then this will create duplicate file names in Vault. How
    do you get around this?


    Cheers


    Scott'

  body: Ok but doesn't that mean I can't push the config settings to the users at
    all? Simply because the same filename would exist in each user folder....

  body: You can still push settings as long as each file has a unique name.  The push
    goes directly from the default folder to the user's local folder.  The user does
    not need their own Vault folder in order for the push to work.

  body: 'ViewStyles.xml would live in Vault under Thunderdome''s "default" folder.  That
    would be the only place that file exists in Vault.  When Thunderdome pushes the
    file to users, ViewStyles gets downloaded directly to the client computer (for
    example, somewhere under C:\Users\myusername\AppData\Roaming).


    So each user will have a copy of ViewStyles on their own computer, but this is
    fine since there is only one copy in Vault.'

  body: 'Ok great, cheers for clarifying.


    I have noticed the add-in has created a folder for each user that is enabled in
    Vault. Are these folders created upon install of the add-in? I just can''t remember
    if its as a result of trying to run the backup or not.


    Also when you select don''t ask me again (re, syncing the profile data) how do
    you get it to ask again or sync again at a later date? Do you have to reinstall
    the add-in?


    cheers for you help doug
