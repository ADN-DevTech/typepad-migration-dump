    in another folder?  No, we do not have events for links.

  body: 'Hi Doug, long time no see,


    There is a new parameter in the api command for file checkout : ''DownloadOptions''.
    Can your provide an example for the ''DownloadPart'' (download in chunks) method
    ? Is it used in combination with the DownLoadFileInParts api method ?

    Does this mean that checkout will generate error 1101 (DownloadFileSizeExceedsServerLimit)
    for large files as from version 2013 ? I experience this error since the upgrade
    to 2013, never have seen this message before on checkout.


    Thanks in advance'

  body: "Yes, you understanding is correct.  If you want to checkout a large file\
    \ and download in the same call, you use the DownloadPart option.  The Checkout\
    \ function will then give you the first part.  Call DownloadFilePart to get the\
    \ rest of the file.\n\nThe SDK documentation for DownloadFilePart shows some sample\
    \ code, but only for DownloadFilePart alone.  I don't have an example of Checkout\
    \ + DownloadFilePart.   \n\nPersonally, I checkout and download as separate calls.\
    \  Checkout and Download are slow operations, so you don't gain much performance\
    \ by combining them into one API call."

  body: 'Hi Doug,


    I have a Vault Professional 2014 API question that I hope you can help me out
    with?

    I have a custom object created that allows me to create a identification number,
    somewhat like when a new item is created. What I would like to achieve is using
    the Vault API that will allow me to create this unique number that is associated
    with other file properties that will match up with this unique number. I am looking
    at the custom entity API would this API allow me to achieve this?

    I have a DECO app that is currently used for to do this to create a new reference
    number. I would like to replicate this using the Vault API.


    I look forward to your reply.

    Many thanks,

    Barry
