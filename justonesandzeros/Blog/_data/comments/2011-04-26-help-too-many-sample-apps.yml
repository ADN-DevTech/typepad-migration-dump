  body: 'One of your developers wrote a routine to "getfoldersctructure" to re-populate
    the local workspace with the folder structure from the vault. This is brilliant!
    Can it be found, re-compiled for 2012 and uploaded?


    Thanks, Dave'

  body: 'I have updated the Effective Folder permissions to work with Vault 2012 and
    I have added a couple of new features.  You can now toggle between seeing the
    permissions for groups and users and clicking on one of the permission icons will
    open up a pop up box allowing you to modify the permissions.

    I''ve tried my best to remove all onesandzeros/Autodesk copyright information
    as you requested.  I did however leave the copyright info in the Credentials_bugfix
    file.  Should I remove it from there as well?'
