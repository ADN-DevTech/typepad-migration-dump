  body: This is great and should become integrated into the product. If this was available
    for Files and Folders (looking at your source). It would offer a "Data Card" like
    option so many other products have. As mentioned above, this really makes custom
    objects worth it. Great Work.

    Will this not work if your Vault is on a network drive?  I''ve created a UI, configured

  body: 'Nice video.  Unfortunately DECO doesn''t have support for links to other
    objects.  So if you want to associate your Task object to a Contact object there
    are a couple of options:

    1. Paste contacts into the "contains" tab for the Task.

    2. Write a custom dialog using .NET programming instead of DECO.


    One more thing.  On the tab view, date values look better when you use a TextBox.  The
    DatePicker control doesn''t do much since tabs are read only.'

    If a property has a list of values associated with it, then you can use a combo
    box for that property in DECO.  But that is the only type of data that DECO can
    show in a combo box.



    If this is a general Vault API question, then you can build your own UI and program
    a combo box to behave however you want.'

  body: 'Hi Doug


    I''ve found the data from vault populates in a drop down list for a combo box
    automatically if there is a list setup in vault.


    I do have a problem though. It seems that it only selects the list items added
    in vault. I have selected IsEditable in the xaml combo box?


    When inputting the data manually in the deco form it doesnt update.


    Any help would be great.


    Thanks

    I''m having difficulties getting the checkbox to work.


    Can it be tagged to a boolean vault property?

    Can you briefly show me what you did to get it working. Did you put a custom property
    in vault as a Boolean? Then add a checkbox in studio and tag the vault property?'

    Another question...sorry to annoy you.


    Can a text box be linked to a number property in vault?
