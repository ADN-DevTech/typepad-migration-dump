  body: If you are a member of the Autodesk Developer Network, then that is the best
    place to go.  They fully support the Vault API and can answer specific Vault API
    issues.  They can also give guidance on your program, such as advising you on
    the best approach or answering if what you have in mind is even possible with
    the API.

  body: 'Your steps are correct for the file dependencies, but there is still the
    issue of the BOM object.  If you don''t provide a BOM, then Item data in Vault
    Professional will not be correct.


    If you are not using Vault Professional and are sure that you will never use it
    in the future, only then you can pass in a null BOM.


    There is also the issue of DWF.  The Vault plug-in creates DWF files when a file
    is checked in.  It can also be configured to queue up a DWF job or do nothing.


    In any event, you will have to do plenty of testing to make sure that files you
    upload still work properly with the rest of the Vault applications.'

  body: 'Thank you very much. I am already struggling on the BOM-object.Well, this
    won''t get easy. Is there any sample code that handles the BOM-object?!? I think
    first of all I need to read out the BOM-structure from Inventor (Item and quantity)
    and then go on and look how to use this knowledge with the BOM-Object...but first
    I GO ON HOLIDAY!!!!

    Have a good time Doug and thank you for your hints.'

  body: 'Creating your own BOM for an Inventor file is a bad idea.  In order to work,
    you need to make sure you come up with the same BOM that the Vault plug-in does,
    and we haven''t released any information on how that BOM is constructed.  So what
    you want to do is unsupported.


    If you try to reverse engineer things, you will probably make a mistake or skip
    over a use-case.  The result might be quite costly, such as the wrong number of
    parts being manufactured.  It''s just too risky.


    We do have it as a wish-list item for the Vault plug-in to be able to silently
    check in a file, but I have no information on when this feature can get into a
    release.'

    I realize this hasn''t been commented on in a while, but hopefully you get a notice
    about a comment.


    How can your installer template be updated to work with Vault 2012?  In searching
    my registry, I don''t see the same registry values used to set the conditions.

    Thanks'

  body: 'I should probably post my 2012 installer.  It''s simpler than the 2011 version.  In
    2012, all extensions go to the same location (%programData%\Autodesk\Vault 2012\Extensions)
    so I don''t need any of the registry stuff to detect the location of the client
    install.


    In installer terms, the [Application Folder] is what maps to ProgramData.  So
    you can build an installer from scratch just by doing a basic file dump.
