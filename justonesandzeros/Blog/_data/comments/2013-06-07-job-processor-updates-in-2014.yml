  body: I would like to know the Pro's and Con's and whether Autodesk prohibts this
    but that is can you run the Job Processor on the ADMS server ? I know it takes
    up a license but the speed gain seems like a benefit , our courrent reseller does
    not recommend doing this but there reasons seem kind of week , what is Autodesk
    stance on this ?

  body: "Autodesk also recommends separate servers for Job Processor and ADMS.  However,\
    \ there is nothing that prohibits you from putting them both on the same server.\n\
    \nJob Processor will consume a Vault license regardless of what server it is running\
    \ on.\n\nAll client/server data is transferred through HTTP, regardless of where\
    \ Job Processor is installed.  Therefore Job Processor should be just as fast\
    \ on a separate machine in the same local network (assuming the local network\
    \ is not unusually slow).  \n\n-----"
