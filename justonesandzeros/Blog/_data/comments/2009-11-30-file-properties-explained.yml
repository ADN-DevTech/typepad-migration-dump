  body: I had someone that wanted something akin to tags, like what you would have
    on photos in a flickr, or photobucket, or on your blog posts. This way he could
    select several files at once, and mark them with those tags. This is something
    he wanted to do to older AutoCAD files, to load into the Vault.

  body: 'In my Vault Manufacturing it is possible to edit "Derived Properties" - with
    the Button "Edit Properties" you can display the column "Author(*)", edit it and
    save it...

    Why does this work? Shouldn´t it work?'

  body: 'The way it works is that, behind the scenes, Vault Explorer checks out the
    file, edits the property within the file, then checks in the file.


    If you download the file and open it inside the CAD application, you should find
    that the property has been updated with the new value.  So the file itself has
    changed, not just a piece of Vault meta-data.'

  body: I was wondering if it is possible to display System properties (as Version)
    when displaying a drawing/exporting to DWG?

  body: 'Generally, no, you cannot map a system property to a file property.  There
    are only 3 exceptions to this rule:  Revision, Lifecycle State Name and Category
    Name.


    You might want to take a look at a good video from Brian Schanen''s blog.  It
    describes how to set up a mapping to the Revision system property. <a href="http://mfgcommunity.autodesk.com/blogs/blog/view/5/vw_map_rev/">http://mfgcommunity.autodesk.com/blogs/blog/view/5/vw_map_rev/</a>'
