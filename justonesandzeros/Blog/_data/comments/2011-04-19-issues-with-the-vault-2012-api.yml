    this way, we will not be fixing the menu bar problem for Vault 2012.


    I''m aware of the issue you logged, but I have not had a chance yet to look at
    it closely.  I''ll contact you directly if I have any questions.

  body: 'Hi <u>Doug Redmond</u>,

    I''m a dotnet developer, and beginner to AutoDesk, for the past 2 months only
    I know about Autodesk. My task is to download the entire project(.dst) from Vault
    to Local path. and open it in AutoCAD. I got an old code from my higher officals
    but it is supported to Vault 2012. Now I''m working with Vault 2015. I made some
    research on some sites(including this), and found as Version Compatibility problem.
    And now I got some stuff(VDF) from this site and successfully downloaded too.
    <br>But I can''t able to access the downloaded file. All It shows like encrypted
    characters. Why.? <br>Is there any steps to access these. ?<br>

    At present I''m thinking about to edit the previous code only. Is this a good
    idea.? or any easy steps are there.?<br>I''m very blank idea in this, so please
    guide me. <br>Any help would be needful. Thanks.'
