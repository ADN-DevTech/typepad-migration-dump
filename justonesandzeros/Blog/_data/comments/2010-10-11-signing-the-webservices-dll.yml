  body: 'Hello,


    Using the above trick, i tried to sign the Vault Explorer 2011 extension DLL.
    Re-compile is possible but when using this signed DLL the explorer add-in isn''t
    working anymore. It complains about missing assembly attribute ApiVersion.


    Is it possible to get around this issue ?'

  body: "You tried to sign Autodesk.Connectivity.Explorer.Extensibility.dll?  That's\
    \ not a good idea because you are not the only one using that DLL.  Vault Explorer\
    \ uses it too.  It's part of the Vault client install, so you shouldn't be modifying\
    \ it.  Even if you do get your project to work, a hotfix or service pack could\
    \ come along and re-write it.\n\nThe reason you can safely modify Autodesk.Connectivity.WebServices.dll\
    \ is because it's not part of the Vault 2011 product.  \n\nSo I should amend my\
    \ earlier statement.  You can sign DLLs yourself only if you are the exclusive\
    \ consumer of that DLL."

    \ when creating a job handler for the Vault job server. The custom job handler\
    \ DLL must be copied in the \\Explorer folder where an unsigned WebServices dll\
    \ already resides. This dll has priority and should not be replaced resulting\
    \ in a failing job handler. Also in this case you can say that you are not the\
    \ exlusive consumer of the DLL. \n-----"
