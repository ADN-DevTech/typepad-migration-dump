  body: 'Hi Doug,


    I ran the installer for Vault Web View 2.0 on my test server for Vault Professional
    2013 as well as on a client computer.  The installer completed successfully and
    even shows up in Add/Remove Programs but I don''t see any new UI elements in Vault
    Pro 2013.  I was expecting to see the new tab and property values and a Configure
    Web View command.  Do you know what I might be missing?


    Thanks,

    Michael'

    Web View.


    If you want to use this app with Vault 2013, you or somebody who knows how to
    program will have to download the source code and port it over to the Vault 2013
    SDK.'
