    Great app. I''m interested in the other way around. To document my lifecycles.
    Any chance that you have this already?

    (a) sample lifecycles like Simple Release, Flexible Lifecycle Definition ....

    (b) Sample Visio file for graphically showing all the transitions for Flexible
    Lifecycle definition

  body: 'I''m not sure about "B".  But in Vault 2012, you can view "A" under Tools->Administration->Vault
    Settings.  In the Behaviors tab, select the Lifecycles button.


    Files in the base category don''t have lifecycles on them.  If you set a file''s
    category to Engineering, you should be able to change the lifecycle on the file.'
