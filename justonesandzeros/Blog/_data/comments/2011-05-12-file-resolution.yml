  body: 'Hi Doug,


    But if we are importing dwg''s with xrefs in bulk using the SDK, what value for
    RefId would we set, so AutoCAD can resolve broken xref links?


    And would ExpectedVaultPath be the path to the file, or the path to the folder
    the file is in?


    Thanks in advance'

  body: 'Officially, the best way to add AutoCAD data is through the AutoCAD plug-in
    or Autoloader.


    That being said, I believe that the xref block name is the RefId.  You can test
    this out by adding DWGs through the plug-in then reading the FileAssoc data through
    the Vault API.


    Expected Vault Path is the full Vault path, folder and file name.  Example:  "$/folderA/fileB.dwg"'

  body: 'Hi Doug,


    I have checked the RefID and it is not the xref block name. It is a number but
    it is not equal to the FileID or the MasterID of the xref DWG or parent DWG. And
    i can not see what kind of number it is yet.


    Do you have any other ideas to look for?


    Thanks in advanced!'
