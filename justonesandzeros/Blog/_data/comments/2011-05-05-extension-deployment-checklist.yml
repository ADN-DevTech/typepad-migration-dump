  body: 'Hi!

    The problem with the validation check (we are talking JobServer)  is that it checks
    every file in the directory. Autodesk should change it to just check the mentioned
    file in the .vcet.config-file and not any relatives. I’ve been struggling the
    whole day and the reason was a dll from a third party supplier that I needed.


    By the way, thanks for your program, it helped me in the right direction, after
    8 hours I feel relieved.

    think JobProcessor.exe itself is trying to load every file in the directory.


    Anyway, good to know things are working for you now.'

  body: 'Hi Doug,


    I am trying to build the PropertyPageSample app.  I am getting the "Error loading
    extension PropertyPageSample" error on starting Vault.


    I tried running the Load Tester utility, and it said that it could not find the  Autodesk.Connectivity.Extensibility.Framework
    version 16.0.56.200.  I checked my project References and I had that DLL, but
    it was version 16.1.58.0.


    Is that really the problem?  How should I approach fixing it?'

    Are you making a test loader for Vault 2013? I have used the test loader for Vault
