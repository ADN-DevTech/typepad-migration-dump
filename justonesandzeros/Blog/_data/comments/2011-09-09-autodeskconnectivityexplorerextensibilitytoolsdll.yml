  body: It works just like the property edit feature in Vault Explorer.  So I believe
    that you do need to take ownership first before attempting to update properties.

  body: '<i>Doesn''t work inside Inventor - Vault Explorer uses Inventor Apprentice,
    which can''t run inside of Inventor.exe.</i>



    I spent 1 day moving my (working) application into an Inventor addon, until I
    found out, that it won''t work there.


    - Is there a way to bypass this issue?

    -Can this Information be added to Help file?

    - Is it still there with Version 2015? (2014 is not working in my case?


    Thanks'

    - Yes, this DLL is still around in 2015 but "UpdateFileProperties" is the only
    function it does.  The rest of the features have been moved to other parts of
    the API.

    If you use the 2015 DLL, then you will need the Vault 2015 client installed as
    well.'

    Nope. In the property edit feature I can modify values for mapped UDPs. The UpdateFileProperties
    will not throw any error but just will not do that. At least that''s for Vault
    2014 SR1 SP2.
