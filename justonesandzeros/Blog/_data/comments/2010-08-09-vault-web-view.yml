  body: Hi Doug, I was wondering if this could be extended to display the HTML file
    content as Preview and possibly attaching URL's to files as well ( Product Description
    of Catalog Information on Items would be a nice add on as well ) Would this be
    supported by the API possibilities?

  body: 'The Preview tab cannot be customized.  So any custom behavior needs to be
    done in a new tab.


    If you have an HTML file in the vault, then you could modify this app to display
    the file contents in the Web View tab.


    Yes, you can associate URL data to a file by creating a user defined property.  Next
    you could modify the app to display the URL from the file property.
