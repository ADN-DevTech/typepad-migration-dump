  body: I was hoping to enhance the capability of Google Maps, since it's part of
    my work to study maps and locations, and this post is what I need. With this,
    I can easily mark the locations on the map that I need, just like using pushpins
    on a wall map. Great work! Thanks a lot!

  body: 'No.  Vault plug-ins are tied to a specific version.  So the code needs to
    be updated to work with Vault 2014 or 2015.
