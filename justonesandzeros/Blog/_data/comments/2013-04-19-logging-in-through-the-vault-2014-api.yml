    it seems.. What a beauty. What´s the difference between ContentConnection and
    EffectiveContentConnection properties?

  body: 'Hey, I''ve gotta say your videos are awesome.  I''ve been .net programming
    for a couple years now, and I''m new to Vault programming as well.  However, I
    tried this and when I debug through VS2010 it works fine, but on it''s own, I
    get the following warning:  "AutoCAD(1.0.0.0) is not compatible with the Data
    Management Server found on ''our vault name''"  Please help!'

  body: 'Nevermind, found the issue.  Apparently AutoCAD 2013 and Vault 2014 don''t
    like to talk to each other.  Performed a "manual" upgrade let''s say, and it worked
    like a charm.  Got a crap ton of errors in AutoCAD but the program worked.  We''re
    going to be updating to AutoCAD 2014 within the next couple of days!


    Thanks anyway!'

    that was the issue, but on a CAD to Vault mismatch instead.
