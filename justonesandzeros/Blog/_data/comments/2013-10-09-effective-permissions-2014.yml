  body: 'Sorry no.  It only runs in the 2014 client.

    However, the source code is available, so somebody may decide to update it for
    the 2016 version.'

  body: 'The "Changes" page in the SDK docs should tell you what to use for removed
    functions.  I apologize if this was not done.


    GetUseACLForItemLifeCycleStates is no longer a global setting.  You can read the
    StateBasedSec value off the LfCycState object.  Call LifeCycleService.GetLifeCycleStatesByIds
    to get the lifecycle state object.



    GetItemLifeCycleStatesACL has been replaced with LifeCycleService.GetStateACLByLifeCycleStateId.
