  body: "The quick answer is no.\n\nThere are things that need to be done before the\
    \ DWF handler can run.  These things may involve creating static resources or\
    \ loading a DWF library.  These steps are handled internally by Job Processor\
    \ and Vault Explorer.  There is no stable way to get to these routines from an\
    \ outside application. \n\n\n-----"
