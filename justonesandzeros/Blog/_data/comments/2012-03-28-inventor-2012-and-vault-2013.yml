    We have users who want to take advatage of the new grid options in the plug in
    browsers, but we cant upgrade our server just yet. So can we have a scenario of
    Vault Pro 2012 server, Inventor/AutoCAD 2012, Vault Professional Client 2013?'

  body: No, a 2013 client cannot talk to a Vault 2012 server.  The compatibility only
    goes one way.

  body: 'I don''t think that the Vault 2013 client will install the Inventor 2012
    plug-in.

    However, the Vault clients can be installed side-by-side.  So you can install
    both the Vault 2012 and 2013 clients.'

  body: 'Hi Doug,

    we had some issues with Vault Client 2012 (Red cross on document grid with Domain
    Users and Domain Admin). Since we couldn''t manage the problem, we planned deploy
    Vault 2013, but we will remain on Inventor 2012. We are testing the use of Inventor
    Plug-in (2012) with Vault Server 2013. We have some minor issue: In Inventor the
    button Launch Vault starts Vault 2012, in dialog boxes like Open etc. the links
    showed belongs to Vault 2012 and not Vault 2013.

    Any suggestion?'

  body: 'Sorry, I don''t have any ideas.  The way it works is that Inventor 2012 has
    no knowledge of Vault 2013.  For all intents and purposes, Inventor still thinks
    it''s working with Vault 2012.


    So I''m not at all surprised that Inventor 2012 launches the Vault 2012 client.'

    Is it also possible to install Inventor 2013 and Vault 2013 client side-by-side
    with Inventor 2011 and Vault 2011 Client.

    We want to setup a test server for Vault 2013 and need to work with 2011 for a
    while.'

    not sure about Inventor though.  You will need to test that out yourself.

    I have an instance of Inventor 2012 and Vault 2013 server. Ererything works fine
    but when customer wants to transfer custon CC libraries he got message "wrong
    version of the server". Is there any way to make this transfer or it''s impossile
    thus there are different versions of software?'

    you will need to check with the Inventor team to confirm.
