  body: 'Thanks for the review of this part of vault.


    We are just starting to plan our move into release states and revision control
    with Vault 2010 Collaboration.  How do we apply this information to the 40 GB
    of existing vault data?'

  body: This is one of those questions that can have hundreds of answers depending
    on your requirements.  My advice is to talk to your re-seller.

  body: I guess what I was looking for was some way to apply various lifecycle states
    to the 1000s of existing files in my database.  For example, we last produced
    an assembly at version 68, rev M.  It is now at version 103.  How do I apply the
    released state to version 68?  It seems that these lifecycle states were designed
    assuming I had an empty vault and was starting from scratch.  Is that true?

  body: 'The real issue here is that you can''t edit historical Vault data.  That''s
    kind of the point of Vault.  Version 68 is ''vaulted'', locked down, nobody can
    change it.


    You do have options however.  For example, you can download version 68, check
    it in as version 104 and set the lifecycle and revision that way.


    Again, your reseller should be able to help you out here.'

  body: 'As I mentioned in the article, there are many dependency trees for a given
    file.  Vault Collaboration has a revision-based view of things (examples 4 and
    5).  Base Vault has a version-based view of things (example 3).


    It looks like you want a version-based tree.  Those links <i>are</i> still there,
    but you may need to write a custom program to get that information.  As I described
    in example 3, you can pass version 68 of your file into <b>GetFileAssociationsByIds</b>
    and get all the child versions.'

    to get the children.  Getting the parents works the same way but you fill out
    different parameters in the function.


    What error code are you getting?'

  body: 'Thanks Doug, that helped.  I did figure out yesterday that a nulls are the
    cause of my error (no associations for a particular file).  The code below (from
    VaultFileBrowser) appears to be complete error trapping but I have a few questions
    which will help me (& others) understand the structure better.  How can associationArrays.Length
    have a value of 0?   How can associationArrays(0).FileAssocs.Length have a value
    of 0?


    If (Not associationArrays Is Nothing AndAlso associationArrays.Length > 0 AndAlso
    Not associationArrays(0).FileAssocs Is Nothing AndAlso      associationArrays(0).FileAssocs.Length
    > 0) Then'

  body: '.NET languages allow a 0 length array.  So I check for that case in the sample
    code.  It might be that the Vault Server never returns a 0 length array.  I check
    for that case anyway just to be safe.
