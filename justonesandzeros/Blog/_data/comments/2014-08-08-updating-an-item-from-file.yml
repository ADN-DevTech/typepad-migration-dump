    \ the duplicates?\n\nRegards,\nPim Saarloos"

  body: 'Here is the answer I got back from the Vault team...


    Since Vault no longer has a wizard, the assign-duplicate functionality is automated.


    In the new code, auto assign duplicates = true will attempt to find duplicate
    items for all bom components and will link them if possible.  If a match is found,
    the component will be linked to the first candidate.  There is no user/API interaction
    involved in this decision.


    Vault 2015 also auto links all subcomponents and standard components regardless
    of the flag.  This behavior has been identified as a bug and may be changed in
    the near future.'

  body: 'Hi Doug,

    i have a hybrid scenario that i cannot solve.

    In Vault 2015 i have an item without any primary file - an "empty box" created
    from another external procedure.

    The drafter, in Inventor, do the draft and simply Add file in Vault. My extension
    must link the ipt/iam with the correct item. Here''s the problem: your code below
    does not work in this case. All can i do is AssignFileToItem first, and then UpdateAndCommitItems.
    In Vault i finally have the File linked with the correct Item, but i don''t have
    the Item preview updated!! To be "all-fine" i must manually go inside the Vault
    GUI, catch the Item and do the update manually.


    Is there a way to do it? In Vault 2013 i made this with the "classic" PromoteFiles
    - probably with less performance but certainly more powerful as use


    Regards,

    Dave'

    In real world there is a 1/n chance to get the right candidate.
