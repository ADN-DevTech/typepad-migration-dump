  body: "Hi Doug,\n\nI'm trying to debug a Vault Client Addin (test) but can't get\
    \ it to work. I actually can't get it to register at all. I've downloaded your\
    \ 'EffectiveFolderPermissions' and made all settings as you suggested above, but\
    \ the addin doesn't load (no new menu options available). So what am I missing\
    \ here? \n\nTIA!\nJoeri"

  body: "This is a common problem.  It's quite easy to miss something and the result\
    \ is your command not showing up (no error).  \n\nHere is a list of things to\
    \ check:\n- You are using the 2011 release or above\n- You are using Vault Workgroup,\
    \ Collaboration or Professional.  In other words, not the base version of Vault.\n\
    - You did a reset of the menus after you first deployed your DLL.\n- You deployed\
    \ your DLL to the correct location.  Make sure not to spell \"Extensions\" wrong.\n\
    - You deployed your .vcet.config file to the same location as the DLL.  \n- You\
    \ have correct information in the .vcet.config file.\n- You provided a display\
    \ name for all your CommandSite objects.\n\nThis list is probably not complete,\
    \ but these are the ones I have run into."

  body: Where do you reset your menus after deploying the DLL?  I'm trying to make
    some changes to your Effective Folder Permissions add-in so that I can manage
    group permissions as well as user permissions.  I've made a few changes to to
    the Util.cs, WebServiceSubclass.cs, and MainForm.cs files but left everything
    else the same.  The vcet.config file is exactly the same.  I've followed the instructions
    above and when I press the play button in visual studio vault opens up as expected
    and the dll and config files are in the Extensions\EffectiveFolderPermissions.  I
    am using Vault Professional.  Is there anywhere I can check for an error message?

  body: I set a break point inside the OnLogOn method in the command class and the
    break point got hit so it seems like the code is at least getting loaded.   It
    looks like I'm getting the Effective Folder Permissions available as a context
    menu item and not in the tools menu as i had expected.  I'll investigate further.

  body: You can do a menu reset by right-clicking on the menu bar in Vault.  Select
    the Customize option and a dialog will pop up that will allow you to reset the
    menu and toolbars.  After the reset, your custom command should show up properly.
