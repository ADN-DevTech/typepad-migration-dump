  body: 'Yes, the articles are still valid for the Vault 2012 release.

    I should probably re-title the posts.'

  body: 'It depends on the system property.  For example, you can change the File
    Name property by checking out the file and checking in with a new name.  You can
    change the Category Name property by setting the category on the file, and so
    on.


    In other cases, your actions may cause a system property value to change, but
    you don''t have control over the new value.  Date Version Created and Version
    are examples of values set by the server.
