  body: 'Hi Doug,


    I''m fairly new to the Vault API; (having previously worked with AutoCAD, and
    more recently Inventor) Do you have a definitive list of "Must-have" Addins for
    Vault - things you can''t do without and recommend for users old & new?


    Thanks,


    Alex.'

  body: 'Good question.  You can see a full list of apps from the sitemap link at
    the top of the page.


    Effective Folder Permissions is one I would consider a must-have for Vault administrators.


    Beyond that, there are apps that are must-have in specialized cases (Q-Tools),
    but are not as useful to the generic Vault install.  There are also a bunch of
    apps that I think are cool (Watch Folder, Link Maestro, Vault Gadget) but I''m
    not sure if they are must-have.


    I recommend scanning through the list of apps and seeing which ones seem useful
    to you.  I''d love to hear your feedback.'

  body: I assume you mean .idw files.  And yes, if the .idw files have DWFs associated
    with them, it should be able to run the compare.

    Noticed that the Drawing Compare App (and the original drawing compare function
    in Autodesk Design Review) has a limitation of not being able to compare tabular
    data and metadata.  I assume that also means that neither will catch metadata
    that is listed as text on the drawing itself (not just the property in the DWF)?'
