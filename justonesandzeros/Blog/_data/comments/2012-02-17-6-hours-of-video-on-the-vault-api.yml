    I’ve watched your recent webinar “on-line” and must admit – the event was very
    helpful. Thanks.

    Now I’ve figured out what our company need to have improved in Vault first of
    all.


    We definitely need to use several CO routings, and as soon as particular routing
    could be set to new CO only on Creation by Change Requestor and can’t be switched
    later by others we need to force this action otherwise half of COs would be assigned
    to wrong (default) routing.


    Could you recommend where to start from in our case?

    Hide “Create new CO” command in client and replace it with custom «a bit modified»
    one?'

  body: 'Hiding the New CO command is a good place to start.  I''m not sure if it
    will work though.  The New commands have special behavior in the File menu and
    toolbar.  Also there are many ways to create a new CO, like from the Item context
    menu.


    I don''t think the event framework will help you.  Once the CO is created, only
    certain people can change the routing.


    Another option is to create checker/fixer routines to handle incorrect COs.  That
    way the Vault admin has a easy way to fix things if something has incorrect data.'

    And then vault admin would contact change requestor and help him to choose the\

    could be used to write this command.'

    I was curious about a comment you made in Part 1 @ 39:18, regarding Vault sign-in
    as "read-only".  Is this option available only through the Vault API, or is there
    a setting from within the Vault client to accomplish this??


    Thanks!'

  body: 'Hi Doug,


    Thanks for this. I am trying to use the

    GetLatestFileAssociationsByMasterIds method to get the revision lable of the first
    chield.

    This is going great. However if more children are present it seems to be random
    which chield it takes the revision from.


    My problem is that I can only chose from all, attachments, dependencies or none.


    Is there some way to specify that I need the revision from the 1st chield?


    Hope you can help me out.'
