  body: Hello.  Is there a way to ensure that when using batch plot all the iproperties
    and mass properties are updated?  I ask because lately when a project is finished
    and someone wants a set of drawings, the batch plot command prints out every bill
    of material in every drawing differently- some with the iproperties right in the
    BOM and some with no properties.  Often times the BOM is right but in assemblies
    the mtotal mass still says "NA".  I can print out each drawing individually and
    update all properties one at a time, but if there are 100 drawings in a set that
    can take hours on end.

    still work, right?

  body: That depends on what you mean by working.  The value should update properly
    in Vault.  But the file itself will still have the old value.  File modification
    always has to be done client-side.

    It sounds like your issues are with the product itself and not the API.  I suggest
    posting your questions to the Vault discussion group:  <a href="http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/Autodesk-Vault/bd-p/101">http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/Autodesk-Vault/bd-p/101</a>'

  body: Is it possible to update the Comment field of an earlier version. The...our...revision
    table is set to use the comment field as the Description of the changes made.
    However, human error as it is...people sometimes forget to enter the changes before
    clicking OK when changing the state back to Released. I'd like to be able to right
    click on a version and add those comments after the fact. I have my extension
    to the point of adding comments to a form...I just can't figure out how to persist
    those comments to the drawing file.

    For example, you add a new file to vault.  So there is only one version of the
    file.  When you run the checkout command, v2 is immediately created.  The checkout
    comment is on v2 and v1 has the comment that was provided when the file was initially
    added.'
