  body: "Have you found a workaround for allowing users to directly download search\
    \ results by clicking on the filename rather than navigating to 'View Profile'\n\
    then 'Click here to download'from within SharePoint? \n\nThis has been our main\
    \ feedback complaint and I realize it is a SharePoint constraint.  In standard\
    \ SP document lists, users are able to click on and access files or download them;\
    \ is there a way you know of to allow this rather than the View Item, View Profile\
    \ choices that are given?\n\nthanks,\n\nBlake"
