    What are you planning on doing with the generated files?'

    way, if there is a failure, you don''t need to waste time generating the files.


    Finding the local file on disk will be a bit tricky because all you get are Vault
    server objects and IDs.'

    I want to develop a function to modify filename by some rule when file is uploaded
    to Vault.

    After reading your article, I find a way.pls help me check.

    1、subscribe the DocumentService post event

    2、call CheckoutFile and CheckinFile to modify filename.

    Is these step talked above right?

    pls. correct them or tell me another way.Thank you so much!'

  body: 'Hi Doug,


    is there a way to update properties in a CheckinFileEvents.Post EventHandler (running
    in Inventor)?


    If it''s not a bug in my code, it seems to me that the "native" vault plugin locks
    the Inventor file.


    So I removed the iProperty mappings and tried checking the file out in the EventHandler
    to update the properties directly via Vault API. The checkout fails with 1004...


    Is there a general "lock" during those operations?

    Would be great, if you could help me with this one :)


    Best regards

    Martin'

  body: 'I don''t know how the native Vault plugin works.  However you should be able
    to figure out what the error is.  Error 1004 is coming from the server, and the
    server treats the Inventor client like any other. There is no special "lock".


    Check that the file isn''t checked out already.  It''s possible that the ''keepCheckedOut''
    setting was set to true.

    Also check that the parameters to your checkout call are valid.'

  body: 'Hi Doug,

    is there a way to know *which* files are Checkin-ing from Inventor without call
    the Web Service? My problem is: i need to know, from an undefined assembly wich
    parts (or sub-assembly) the designer are saving to Vault, to read their iProperties
    and saving them on my mirror DB. It''s enough to get the filelist of the ChecklistFiledialog
    that appears before Inventor Checkin files in Vault


    Thx in advance,

    the ID.  You need to make the web service call to get the File object.

    .NET plug-in to Inventor.  From there, you can interface directly with the Vault
    DLLs, which are also .NET.
