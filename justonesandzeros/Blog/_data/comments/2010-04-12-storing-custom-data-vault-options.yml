  body: 'Serialization is the process of converting an object into another format.  For
    example, converting an object to XML so it can be saved as a file.


    Wikipedia has a nice page on it:  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serialization">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serialization</a>'

  body: 'You don''t need to browse these options.  You hard-code a option name and
    use that name to look up the data.  So it''s always a direct look-up.


    Most people use their company name and product name in the option name to avoid
    collisions.  For example:  "Autodesk.deco.settings"
