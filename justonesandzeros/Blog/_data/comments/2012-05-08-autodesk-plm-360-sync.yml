  body: 'Doug, nice summary! I have a question about Item Management practices when
    work with Vault /PLM 360 sync tools. As I understand, Items and BOM will be always
    synchronized "one-way" like you explain here -->


    ===

    Revision History - When an item is synchronized, all revisions get synchronized.  So
    you can view the item history in PLM 360 just like you can in Vault.


    BOM - The entire BOM is synchronized, not just a single item.  Again, the result
    is an identical data in Vault and PLM 360.

    ===


    So, where /how do you suggest to manage Item Masters? Is it Vault of PLM 360?
    Another question is about multiple Bill of Materials? How do you recommend to
    manage multiple BOMs when you''re synching BOM all the time from Vault? Let say
    I want to have EBOM/MBOM/PurchaseBOM/AssemblyBOM/AsBuiltBOM. I assume every BOM
    will seat in a separate Workspace, correct? In that case, how should I synchronize
    BOM from Vault?


    Thanks, Oleg'

  body: With the first version of PLM sync, Vault is the Item Master but you can sync
    different 'Item Searches' to different workspaces if you like.

  body: 'What you are asking is not currently supported.  The intent of the sync tool
    is to replicate the Vault data in PLM 360.  Since Vault doesn''t have a built-in
    concept of different BOM types, the synced data doesn''t have that concept either.  So
    syncing data to multiple PLM workspaces isn''t going to help because the data
    will be identical.


    The intent for R1 of the sync tool is that the item data should be read-only in
    PLM 360.  So I don''t recommend trying to alter the BOM once it gets to PLM 360.


    In future releases, we will adding more functionality, but I can''t go into the
    specifics right now.  You bring up good points to keep in mind.  Thanks.
