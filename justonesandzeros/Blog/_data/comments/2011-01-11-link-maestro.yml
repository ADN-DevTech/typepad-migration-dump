  body: What does Copy Link do?  I searched for it but couldn't find it.  I need to
    know what Copy Link does so I know what Link Maestro does.

  body: "The out-of-the-box \"Copy Link\" command can be found under the Edit menu.\
    \  In Vault 2012 this command was renamed to \"Copy Hyperlink\".\nIf you don't\
    \ have a file selected, you may not see the command.\n\nThe default behavior is\
    \ to create a URL for the currently selected item and save that text to the clipboard.\
    \  You can then paste the URL into an email or document. \n\nLink Maestro enhances\
    \ this command by allowing more options for the URL format."

  body: You can only do that by editing the source code and re-building.  In code,
    you can add a new CommandSite with FileContextMenu as the location.  Add the copy
    link command to the site and you should be good.

  body: "Hi Doug,\nIs it possible to elaborate on how to Hide Commands, I'm new to\
    \ the vault API, and I need to write something which will hide the \"Submit and\
    \ force Approval buttons\". \nI've got my dll.s set up, and I've figured out where\
    \ the Hidden Commands function is, I'm just having issues figuring out how to\
    \ use it.\nDo you have any VB examples of how something like this may be accomplished,\
    \ or are you able to elaborate on what needs doing?\n-----"
