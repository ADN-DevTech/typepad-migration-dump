    I used it with Vault 2013 Pro. It''s workung like desribed, but there is one thing
    that hurts me a little bit:

    The KnowledgeVault database-entries for the subscriber are missing (SQL-Tables:
    Sites + VaultSite).


    The effect of this is, that the same FielStore-path is use by both instances.


    Is there a way to get the full functionality by manually adding the missing entries?'
