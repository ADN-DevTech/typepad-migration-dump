    Is possible to have multiple deployments? Our manufacturing engineers have a different
    grid state than our design engineers. Our purchasing even has a different grid
    state.

    Thanks for the awesome tool!'

    The Vault team is now maintaining that app.'

    and Professional.

    Vault Basic doesn''t support plug-ins to the Vault Explorer client, which is why
    you need Workgroup or higher.
