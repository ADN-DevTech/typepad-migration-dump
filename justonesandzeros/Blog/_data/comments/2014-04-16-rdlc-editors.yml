    Express (and the Report Add-in) just the week before you posted about this - checking
    Microsoft''s site today reveals that it too has been removed. :(


    Thanks for posting the alternative. FWIW do you know if Vault 2015 still uses
    2008 format RDL files or if it has moved to the RDLC (2010) format?'

    Regardless, Autodesk should have already moved to the 2010 format...'

  body: 'Hello there,


    quick question on my side: Can we customize the report to only show row with specific
    property?

    For exemple, I would have liked to show only component in the release state or
    I would like to add a custom property to filter only a value like "Sheetmetal".

    I''ve tried to play with RDL Designer but I could not succeed in this.


    Thanks for your support.

    on the table or something like that.
