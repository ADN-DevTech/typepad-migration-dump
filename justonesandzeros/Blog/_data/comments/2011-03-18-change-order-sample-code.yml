  body: 'Hi,


    I am looking for some help regarding the Vault 2014 API to have an event triggered
    when an ECO item is at review state and the user clicks the approve option from
    the actions menu. What I am looking for is a Vault API call to catch this event
    and do some function there after.

    What event handler should I use from the 2014 API?


    Many thanks.
