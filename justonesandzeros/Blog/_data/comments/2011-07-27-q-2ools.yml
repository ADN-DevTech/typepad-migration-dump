    Yes, you can install Q-Tools on the ADMS server.  It can actually be installed
    anywhere on the network as long as it can connect to all the Vault sites.'

  body: Doug - I saw a post from you from back last year saying that the tool was
    only designed to run on a multi-workgroup environment.  We have a filestore only
    replicated environment, has this tool been updated recently to cater for that?
    Reason I ask is that the Q-Tools service won't start unless I chose false to having
    a central queue.

    download it from the links in this post.


    If that''s not the problem, send me your settings.xml file.  It''s probably best
    to post it to the Vault Customization newsgroup:

    Just make sure to clear out any important data, such as passwords.'

  body: 'Hi,


    We have a multi site replicated vault environment and your application look like
    it will solve our job processor issues.  I have installed and set-up so that we
    have one central job queue, I am running into an issue that when the job processor
    runs I am getting an error stating that the file is locked.  I suspect this is
    because the server the job queue is running on is not the "owner" of the file?  do
    you have any thoughts of how to resolve this?


    Thanks'

    In Vault 2012, fixing this issue requires custom programming.  You need to either
    modify QTools or create your own tool to transfer file ownership.'

  body: 'It should be fairly easy to update this app since it''s not a plug-in.  Here
    are the basic steps:


    1. Download the source code.

    2. Open the project in the latest Visual Studio version.

    3. Set the references to the 2015 or 2016 Vault SDK DLLs.

    4. Fix any compile errors that may arise from changed APIs.  See the "Changes"
    pages in the SDK documentation.
