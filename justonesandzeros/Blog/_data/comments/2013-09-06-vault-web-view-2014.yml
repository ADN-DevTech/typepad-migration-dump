  body: "Doug, \n\nIs there a technical reason why the Top Level Domain can't be part\
    \ of the Text Property? As it is you would need a tab for each one.... .net .com\
    \ co.uk .co.nz .com.au etc etc. Since there are so many it seems like this would\
    \ be a reasonable limitation towards practically using this feature.\n\nCheers\n\

    just used "http://www.{sitename}.com" as an example of how data gets substituted.


    If the entire web address is a property value, then you set the URL to "{web address}".'

  body: 'Hi Doug,


    just asking if you still select this one to stay alive or is it coming to and
    end of life soon? It is a nice application which is useful within vault to shao
    additional content - like if this object has relations to a cloud store or representation
    in another application (when web based)

    Any plans from your side ?'
