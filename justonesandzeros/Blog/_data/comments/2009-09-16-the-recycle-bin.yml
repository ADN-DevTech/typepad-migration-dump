  body: 'Creating a list of Released files is something you can do in Vault Explorer.  You
    can run the Find command and search for cases where "State" is "Released".


    In the API, you can run the search with FindFilesBySearchConditions in the Document
    Service.  The VaultFileBrowser example in the SDK has an example of how to use
    this function.'

    a lifecycle state on a file.  That feature was introduced in the 2010 product
    line and not available in PS 2009.
