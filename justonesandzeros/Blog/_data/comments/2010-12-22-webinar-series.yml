    The link above is for a problem I''m seeing where a spreadsheet is driving an
    assembly & just checking in & out updates the vault version eventhough no design
    changes have been made - tick these boxes changes this behaviour & I can''t find
    an explanation of what they do.


    Thanks

  body: 'Correct, these comments are not the preferred mechanism for tech support.  Also,
    your issue doesn''t seem to have anything to do with custom Vault programming,
    so it''s not a good fit for this blog.


    Lastly, I don''t know much about how the check-out dialog works, so I honestly
    don''t know the answer to your issue.


    Sorry that I couldn''t have been more help.  You might want to try posting to
    the newsgroup again.  Sometimes a second post works.
