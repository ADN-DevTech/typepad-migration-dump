  body: 'If an application is built that references this DLL, how is it resolved since
    it resides outside of the scope of the web services path (i.e. <a href="http://<servermame>/autodeskdm)?">http://<servermame>/autodeskdm)?</a>


    So, lets assume I were to built my own vault client (I know the client is customizable
    - this is a hypothetical example then).  On my dev machine the DLL is available.  However,
    I now deploy my custom client to other workstations that do not have the ADMS
    installed on them.  Since the DLL is outside the above path, won''t that cause
    runtime problems for the custom app?'

  body: Immediately after posting this; I realized that the solution is most likely
    to just include the DLL with my custom application as part of its deployment.

  body: That's a great help! Makes things a lot easier! Would it be possible to sign
    the assembly (strong name)?

  body: 'Yes, you can sign the DLL if you need to.


    There is a trick using SN.exe and ILDASM.exe, which are .NET tools provided by
    Microsoft.  You basically de-compile the DLL to IL code, then you re-compile with
    a key.
