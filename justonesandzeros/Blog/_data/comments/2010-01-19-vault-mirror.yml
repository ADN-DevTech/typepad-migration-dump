    We can we find the exe of the vaultmirror?

    Beacause in Vault 2011 we only see the proj (source code),

    but no exe.


    Do we still have to build in VisualStudio?

    Can we download the exe ?


    Thanks'

    I did that but now I am getting an error message when try to run Vault Mirror.

    The dialog box is there just when the actual mirror is supposed to start I am
    getting an error message:


    Error loading IExplorerUtl.

    This is usually cased by the Vault Client not being installed or an DLL load error...


    Can you help.

    I have both Vault client and server 2012 installed on same 64 bit computer.

  body: 'Hallo Doug


    in the past we used this tool the export all de .dwf files to a folder.

    but after a move from one server to another (Vault 2013 basic) some files where
    missing.

    after some study we found that the files with the .dwg.dwf extension where copied
    but the files with the extension .DWG.dwf where not. so they seem to be case sensitive.

    is this a known issue? and is there an update / solution


    thanks'
