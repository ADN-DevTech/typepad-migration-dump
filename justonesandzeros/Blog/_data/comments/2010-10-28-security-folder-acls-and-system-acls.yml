  body: 'Hi, i would like to edit the file security with .net.

    i currently inherit the security from the folder, but with the functions addsystemacl
    and setsystemacl i cannot overwrite the files security settings.

    Manually i would set the checkbox in the file properties "overwrite security"
    and modify them.

    How could i get that with .net ?

    thanks'

    \ Maybe we need to simply clear the file System ACL applied by the lifecycle state\

    Example of the code would be very much appretiated\nRegards Bry"

  body: 'Clearing the system ACL will cause the file to revert to folder security.


    If you don''t ever want to use lifecycle security, you can just clear the security
    details on the lifecycle state settings.  That way you don''t have to come up
    with an API solution.


    Yes, you can update the ACL data through the API.  And you can trigger the code
    on a state change.  However permissions becomes a problem.  Only administrators
    can directly set ACL data.  So you would have to work around that problem.'

  body: 'Doug,


    Is there a way to check the permissions of the current folder without using the
    standard method? everytime we wont to read the information in readonly mode we
    get a error 303.


    sample code : Vault.Library.ConnectionManager.LogIn(servername, vaultname, "user",
    "Password", Vault.Currency.Connections.AuthenticationFlags.Readonly, null.


    Reason for this question is that the standard methode requires a Vault License
    and we want to use this for all Vault users.

    Regards Iwan'
