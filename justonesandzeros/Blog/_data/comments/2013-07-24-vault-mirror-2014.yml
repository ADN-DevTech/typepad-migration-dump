  body: 'The readme file contains most of the documentation, including the command
    line arguments.  But it still doesn''t go into much detail.


    -WF downloads the files to your working folder location.  It''s for people who
    want to use Vault Mirror like workspace sync.

    For most cases, I recommend -F which lest you specify a separate download location.  That
    way the mirror files are separate from files you may be working on.'

  body: 'Hello Doug,


    I am fresh meat to the Vault Administration world and was looking for a way for
    our sales n such to view the idw''s in our vault without the need for vault on
    every pc. Awesome. Simple. Well done, thanks very much for sharing! I am having
    a problem with the Partialmirror Switch. We use a scheduled task to run vault
    mirror. It is run with administrative access. The scheduled task looks like this:


    Program: "C:\ProgramData\Autodesk\ApplicationPlugins\Autodesk Vault Mirror 2015.bundle\Contents\V2015\VaultMirror.exe"


    Arguments: -PartialMirror -U Administrator -P xxxx -S WS2008R2 -V innotech -L
    "C:\Innodat\vaultlog.txt" -F "C:\Vault" –nofail


    The user running the task has full permissions to the folder C:\Vault. The log
    file logs a clean run. If I run a full mirror, change an ipt file, then check
    the ipt back into the vault it is not mirrored. It does not matter whether I run
    vaultmirror manually or from the scheduled task. The idw was updated. Any ideas?


    Thanks very much,


    Adam
