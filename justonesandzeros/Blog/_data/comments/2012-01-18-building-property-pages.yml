  body: "Hi Doug,\n\nThanks again for this great and sample. Dan Leighton’s class\
    \ was indeed fun & great to attend...!\n\nI have two questions regarding the property\
    \ pages:\n\n1) Would it be possible to include some general code in an extension\
    \ (pretty much similar to what included in this blog item), but instead of compiling\
    \ an userform in the extension make a reference in the extension to a webpage?\
    \ \n\nThe workflow i am thinking of is to add a webpage to the IIS which is being\
    \ used by Vault. Then add a detailpane tab with a WebBrowser control on it and\
    \ load the webpage. \n\nThe extension should load all the right properties into\
    \ the controls which are placed on this webpage. This workflow would make it very\
    \ easy to make changes to the properties shown and the positions of the controls\
    \ without having to recompile the extension.\n\nWould it be possible? Do you have\
    \ any tips or concerns about this workflow? (I personally never did something\
    \ with aspx pages)\n\n2) In the current Vault API it is possible to add custom\
    \ DetailPane tabs, but it's not possible to change the order of the tabs.. Could\
    \ that be made possible in a future release? Or is that impossible to introcude?\
    \ (I would like the Property Page for example to be before the History tab)."

  body: '1) I don''t have much experience programming web pages either, but in theory
    you can apply the same techniques as with a winform dialog.


    Based on our own web client, I can say that managing the Vault security is one
    of the difficult aspects of this approach.  For example...

    How do you maintain the Vault credentials?  How do you know when to log out of
    Vault?


    2) It''s not possible to control the tab order, and it''s not on our roadmap.  But
    I''ll keep the feature in mind.  Thanks.'

    I think.


    Why do you ask?'
