  body: 'I appreciate this.  It''s simple in terms of the difference in accessing
    the exe vs inside vault, but since I''m usually already in vault it will be nice
    to just load it from there.


    On a side note, when I read first the post I read it as dogpunch and I''m like
    why on earth!  Then I re-read it the correct way and laughed out loud!'

  body: Hello, is this compatible with 2014? I need to add job "Create PDF" to lifecycle
    with plugin from cool orange, but i see there that Lifecycle Event Editor is mostly
    for 2013 versions.

    The workaround is to go to the SDK folder under your client install location.  Install
    the SDK, then go to the Util folder under the SDK''s install location.  There
    you will find an EXE version of the Lifecycle Event Editor.'
