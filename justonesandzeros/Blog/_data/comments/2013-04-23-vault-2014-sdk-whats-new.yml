  body: Sorry, no.  Persistent IDs is a completely independent feature.  It's not
    related to properties or categories.  So it will not help in creating category
    rules.

  body: If I check out (not download) the file using acquirefiles how do I check it
    in as CheckinFile requires a path to the local file, but I didn't download it.

  body: 'If you acquire to the default location, it will put the files on disk according
    to your Working Folder settings.


    I believe the function you want is Connection.WorkingFolderManager.GetPathOfFileInWorkingFolder'

  body: 'When I have a WebServiceExtension and I need to checkout a file, set the
    value of a user defined attribute and checkin the file, how can I get a Connection
    or FileManager object to be able to acquire the file and do the work.


    Currently, I''m trying to achieve that using DocumentService.CheckoutFile + DocumentService.CheckinUploadedFile
    but I have all kind of error at the checkin step.
