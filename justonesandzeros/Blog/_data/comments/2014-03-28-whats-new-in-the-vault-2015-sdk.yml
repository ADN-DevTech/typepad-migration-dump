  body: 'Hi,


    I have to migrate a VS2010 solution that was for VaultPro 2011 to VaultPro 2015.


    1. Must I use the VDF (for example to SignIn the Vault)?

    2. Must I need to use Visual Studio 2012 ?


    Thanks,'

  body: "1. Technically, no.  You don't need to use the VDF.  But the upload/download\
    \ workflows have changed.  Overall, uploading and downloading is much easier through\
    \ the VDF.  \n\nEither way, you will have code to update, I believe it's easier\
    \ to move over to the VDF.\n\n2. You will need a Visual Studio edition that supports\
    \ .NET 4.5.  I'm not sure if VS 2010 does that.  Both VS 2012 and VS 2013 should\
    \ work fine."
