  body: 'Our company decided to develop own serch utility.

    Features desired:

    1. Search with custom PS script.

    2. Subscribe to search results (including 1).

    First is already done. Second is real but tricky. If use WatchFolder techology
    - the security of JP seems to be at risk - custom PS script could kill JP. Do
    you have any ideas on how it could be done without security risks?'

  body: "Let me repeat the problem to make sure I understand.  You want to automatically\
    \ run a script that sends out search results, but you want to filter those results\
    \ on the user's permissions.  \n\nThere is no easy way to do this.  You would\
    \ need to...\n1. Grab the ACLs on all the files.\n2. Grab all the users/groups\
    \ and their roles.\n3. Go through each file in the result set and determine if\
    \ the user has access to that file.\n4. Repeat step 3 for each user that you are\
    \ sending results to.\n\nStep 3 is a very complex algorithm, but my Effective\
    \ Permissions app has some code you might be able to use.  Personally, I don't\
    \ like using PowerShell for something that complex.\n\n\nAnother approach would\
    \ be to run the query client-side.  For example, when the user logs in to Vault\
    \ Explorer, the query runs in the background.  That way, the Vault Server does\
    \ the security check for you."

  body: 'With this tool is there anyway to Search for items and files where a property
    like "Number" equals another property like "Drawing Number"?  In the value field
    I tried to put Drawing number in quotes, brackets, and arrows but no luck.



    Thanks

    a requirement from the underlying search engine.
