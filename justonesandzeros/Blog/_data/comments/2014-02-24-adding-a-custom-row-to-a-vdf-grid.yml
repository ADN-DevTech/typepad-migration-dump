  body: "It's a crying shame that the results of all this awesome VDF goodness can't\
    \ be passed to any of the existing Vault commands such as Send File. \n\nEven\
    \ when you put a VDF control into a Vault tab, all of the normal Vault commands\
    \ are greyed out. From a UX standpoint that is quite strange, since the rest of\
    \ the default tabs don't behave that way from the user's perspective.\n\nWe don't\
    \ think there is, but are you aware of a work around? one which doesn't involve\
    \ re-writing/creating the native Vault commands in our own code. (Not all of the\
    \ calls made by the Send File command are supported in the API)."
