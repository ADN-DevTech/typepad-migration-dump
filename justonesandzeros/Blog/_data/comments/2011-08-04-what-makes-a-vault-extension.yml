  body: 'hi!this is my first post in just one and zeros, i was wondering how to handle
    a multiple plug in scenario

    where those plugins shares a library who''s not in the GAC but it''s strong named.

    Whould it be possible to do an assembly load somewhere ?'

    I''m talking about the 2013 API and to me looks like adding to the class that
    implements the iExtension interface a constructor, that will be called.

    BUT unfortunately seems like that vault checks for all the reference the plugIn
    needs and if he can''t find all of them just does not load the plugin so no custom
    load is allowed ... kinda of frustrating :('

    \nNext, if your DLL references another DLL not in the GAC, you have a couple of\
    \ options.  \nYou can copy the referenced DLLs to the same folder as your extension.\
    \  But this only works if there are a few small DLLs.\nIf you are dealing with\
    \ a large API framework, you will have to remove all direct references in your\
    \ project, and use one of the Assembly.Load functions instead.  This makes your\
    \ code much harder to work with, but it allows your DLL to load first before loading\
    \ the references.\n\nI'm aware that DLL load paths are an issue, and the issues\
    \ is being worked on."

  body: 'Actually i found a dirty solution, Since the nice ones where not working!

    I''ve created a new plugin who bind the appdomain.AssemblyLoad event to a function
    who scan what is being loaded and i managed to get it loaded first, when Vault
    try to load my plugin i do an assembly load of my libs...

    I think would be nice to understand if it is vault who''s checking for dependency
    to prevent crashes during later use (i think this is probable) or it''s the clr,
    so maybe in the next API the could give us an overridable function called LoadAssemblies
    who get called before the check... maybe

    Or a list of dll paths who vault can try to load and skip the plugin loading if
    some fails'

    to fix things by manually loading from known locations, but it could be more robust.

  body: 'Hello,


    As I understand Web Service Command Extension is loaded on any application which
    is using Autodesk.Connectivity.WebServices.dll.


    I have created such extension and it does load when Vault client is launched.


    But my extension doesn''t load when Inventor with Vault addin is launched.


    What can be wrong?

    Is Vault addin for Inventor use Autodesk.Connectivity.WebServices.dll?


    Regards,

    Kamil'

  body: 'My first guess is that is a version issue.  Events only work for a specific
    version.  So if you build event handlers with the 2015 SDK, it will only work
    with the 2015 clients.

    If that''s not the problem, have a look at this article on how to get more information.  <a

    And yes, Inventor uses Autodesk.Connectivity.WebServices.dll.
