  body: 'Could this be modified to take advantage of the SDK: Lifecycle Event Editor,
    instead of a scheduled task?


    Also, instead of kicking off an email, what about kicking off a BAT (script file)?'

  body: 'Yes, you can use the Lifecycle Event Editor, but it won''t pick up new files
    or generic check-ins.  It will only pick up lifecycle state changes.

    See this post for more information:  <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2010/03/lifecycle-event-jobs.html">http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2010/03/lifecycle-event-jobs.html</a>


    And yes, you can run a bat file if you want.  When handling a job, you can do
    anything that a .NET DLL can do.'

  body: 'Hi, Doug

    I have an important customer that asked for this feature and It would be excellent
    if this plug-in could be available for 2012 versions of vault. Maybe, are you
    planning to upgrade it?. Any help it will be appreciated.

    Thanks!!'

    in the release cycle, and these apps fall low on my priority list.


    However, I posted the source code.  So feel free to update it yourself for find
    a programmer who can.
