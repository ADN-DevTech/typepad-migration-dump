  body: "Hi Doug, I was looking for an app that will clean some of my folders with\
    \ non-referenced files. One problem is that I have Vault WG 2016 and your app\
    \ is 2015. :(\nDo you plan to upgrade your app to 2016 in the near future?\nI\
    \ wonder why Autodesk does not create a command in Vault to just do that. \nLooking\
    \ forward for your response. Thanks mate.\nMarcelo\nmdt@3D-Design.com.au"

    my Vault apps current.  The source code is available, so it''s possible that someone
    will come along and update this app.
