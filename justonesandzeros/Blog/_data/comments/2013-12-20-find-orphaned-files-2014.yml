    My qestion: Why we cannot the result window like others in the Vault and copies
    the results into an excel sheet?

    Is there no way to sort (e.g. by state) ? Would do the deleting easier.'

    I remember stumbling upon this tool back in 2014 when I was desperately trying
    to clean up my cluttered computer. "Find Orphaned Files 2014" was a lifesaver!
    It helped me locate and organize those forgotten files that were scattered all
    over my system, making my digital life so much more manageable. I can''t believe
    it''s been years since I first used it, but I still appreciate the efficiency
    and simplicity it brought to my file management. Thanks for the nostalgic reminder'
