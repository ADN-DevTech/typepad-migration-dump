    noting here...


    HiddenCommands() gets called very early in the process - before you have logged
    in. So there''s no way of using it for "runtime" turning off of commands, i.e.
    hide "config" commands unless you''re an admin.


    Does this sound correct?'

    hide commands based on the current user''s access level.


    All Vault Explorer commands have this limitation, not just custom commands.
