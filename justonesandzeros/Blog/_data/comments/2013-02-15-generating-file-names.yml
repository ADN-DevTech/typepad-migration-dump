  body: 'Hello, in Vault 2015 R2,

    If you have a custom numbering scheme(Fixed Text, Free text and Pre-defined list)
    where one of his Fields is a Pre-defined list, is possible to get the "description"
    from each "item" from this pre-defined list?


    Pre-defined list:

    Code - Description

    X    - Stand

    B    - Blue

    G    - Green


    I will get the Description of each item of the list.

    Is it possible with C#?


    Thank you!'

  body: 'DocumentService.GetNumberingSchemesByType() returns an array of NumSchm objects.  Each
    one of those objects has a full description of a numbering scheme, including the
    fields involved.


    Keep in mind that NumSchmField can be subclassed into objects that are specialized
    to each field type (FreeTxtField, AutogenField, and so on).'
