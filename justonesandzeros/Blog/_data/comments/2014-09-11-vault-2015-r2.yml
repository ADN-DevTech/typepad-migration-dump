    May you confirm me than the SP1 for 2015 (<a href="http://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/vault-products/downloads/caas/downloads/content/autodesk-vault-2015-service-pack-1-for-autodesk-vault-basic-2015-autodesk-vault-workgroup.html?v=2015)">http://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/vault-products/downloads/caas/downloads/content/autodesk-vault-2015-service-pack-1-for-autodesk-vault-basic-2015-autodesk-vault-workgroup.html?v=2015)</a>
    is related only for 2015 R1 and not 2015 R2.
