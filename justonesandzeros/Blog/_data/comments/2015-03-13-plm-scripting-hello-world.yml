  body: 'I''m still here, but my current product doesn''t have a public API.  That''s
    why I haven''t been posting much on Vault lately; I''m not on that product anymore.  I''m
    hoping to find a developer on the Vault team to post new content.


    In the meantime, ADN posts Vault articles on their blog:  <a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/manufacturing/vault/">http://adndevblog.typepad.com/manufacturing/vault/</a>'

  body: 'Michal - great stuff! I''m sure this is gonna be super helpful to a lot of
    PLM 360 customers and I''ll make sure that every developer at ERP Guru (Autodesk
    PLM 360 Advisor, www.erpguru.com) reads it. As Martin said, keep them coming!

    Thanks!'
