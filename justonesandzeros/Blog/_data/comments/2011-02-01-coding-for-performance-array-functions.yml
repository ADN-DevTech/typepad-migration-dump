    How do you explain the nonlinear growth of the red curve? I would have expected
    two *linear* curves, where one curve is steeper than the other.


    kind regards

  body: "The red line curves up slightly at the end due to my laptop running out of\
    \ resources.  This is the computer I use for development, so I had a debug version\
    \ of Vault running.  Then I started a VMWare image with Vault 2011 client and\
    \ server running.  My test app then connected to the server in the VMWare and\
    \ ran the tests.\n\nNeedless to say, this wasn't an ideal test.  By the end, all\
    \ my memory was gone and my hard drive was getting a good workout.  \n\nIn a better\
    \ environment, you would see a more linear red line."

  body: 'Doug, could you please explain following:

    - Calling FindLatestFilesByPaths() and passing a string array with 250 items takes
    about 300 seconds (one Web Service call)

    - Calling FindLatestFilesByPaths() for each every item takes about 240 seconds
    (250 Web Service call)


    To measure the time I took a Stopwatch object and I tried this multiple times
    to play it safe.. relating to your upper article progress with only one Web Service
    call should be much faster - any explanations?'

    It's rare for these cases to happen, but it's possible.  For read operations,\
