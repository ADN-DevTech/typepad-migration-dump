  body: 'Hi Doug,

    I''ve honestly tried. Almost a week without any visible progress :(

    IMHO to give some boost to the topic several "snippets" for admin-daily-tasks
    need to be shared.

    Could you provide at least 3 for:

    - Searching objects (files, items etc) by criteries.

    - Editing Items (change ItemNumber, fill UDP etc).

    - Editing ECOs (ex. change routing).

    Thank in advance.'

  body: Sure, I can provide some vLogic examples.  What things are giving you difficulty?  Is
    it PowerShell?  The Vault API?  Both?

  body: In the section "To use:" where the post says "you will have to re-start Vault
    Explorer" means you need to restart Vault and log out of Inventor (and presumably
    any other logged in client). I was confused that I could not see the newly created
    Command until I logged out of Vault from Inventor and restarted Vault Client.

  body: Finally my interest have returned to the topic. I've just tried first sample
    and got incomplete results. My guessing - It only shows first 100 matches. What
    are possible options of workaround this?
