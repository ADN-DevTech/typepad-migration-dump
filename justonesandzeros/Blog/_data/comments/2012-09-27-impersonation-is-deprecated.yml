  body: 'I use Impersonate function in solution that allows WebDAV access to Vault
    files.

    The user name is taken from ASP after NTLM authentication and passed to Vault.

    Vault Impersonate was a good help since Windows NTLM does not support impersonation.

    I cannot take NTLM ticket from user and pass it to Vault.'
