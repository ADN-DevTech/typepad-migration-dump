  body: "Hi Doug, \nfirst of all many thanks for this article.\nI need some help to\
    \ update a Vault Extension from 2013 to 2015. I made an extension that automatically\
    \ update an item to the most recent file version during the checkout_Post event\
    \ of Inventor. This extension uses the old-and-removed function \"UpdateFromFile\"\
    .\nWith the new Vault SDK i'm not able to obtain the same result; i don't want\
    \ to made a new item revision every time due to my company restrictions.\n\nI've\
    \ tried the new \"UpdateItemFileAssociation\" passing the unique Id coming from\
    \ the Inventor CheckIn event, but in Vault the result is that the item lose his\
    \ file (the primary). If i manually do an Update from the Vault client all is\
    \ ok again....but the intention of this extension is exactly to do an automatic\
    \ item update.\n\nI'm quite desperate....\nThanks anyway in advance\n\nDave"

  body: 'I should probably write a blog article with a sample of the Update workflow.

    In the meantime try this:

    Use the code from this article but replace the "AddFilesToPromote" call with a
    call to "UpdatePromoteComponents".  The rest of the sample should be the same.'

  body: 'Hi Doug,

    Thanks so much for all your insights.

    I have used your code to build an app for promoting all legacy files to Items.
    The problem is, this code works perfect on single part files (.ipt), but assemblies
    (.iam) with components throw an error code (1387) for restrictions. I used your
    code, to drill down in the exception, and found the following exception, (2037)
    Operation cannot be performed because the item is not in an editable state. Can
    you please help?'

  body: 'Is the error thrown on UpdateAndCommitItems?


    If so, I suggest looking at the "status" array on the itemsAndFiles object.  If
    the status on an Item is 1 (unaffected), then the Item wasn''t edited.  When calling
    UpdateAndCommitItems, only pass in the Items that were promoted or updated.'

  body: Never mind, I found the solution in one of your older blog posts. The issue
    was that GetPromoteComponentsResults() was returning more Items that I needed,
    and some of them were not in edit mode.
