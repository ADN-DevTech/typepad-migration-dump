    If there a way (apart from ECO workflow) to get notification about publishing
    new Item revisions?'

  body: There is no built in way.  But if the new revision comes from a state change,
    then you could write a job handler to send out the email.  Watch Folder uses a
    similar concept.

  body: 'Hi Doug. Not sure if you still monitor comments from 5 year old threads,
    but this seemed relevant.


    I have been migrating one of our tools that used ItemLifecycleExtension in the
    olden days to use the job processor.


    This is one of those scenarios where now, the system might create 1000 individual
    jobs rather that one job with a bunch of items.


    Are there any examples, patterns or other suggestions for how to queue up jobs,
    and perhaps execute them every 5 minutes (knowing that there''s a chance you could
    lose them if the job server was closed)?


    Thanks,

    Matt'

    the post is.


    Anyway, one possible solution is to not use JobProcessor, which handles one job
    at a time.  I have another post describing how you can build your own service
    to read jobs off the queue.  This allows you to get around the limitations of
    JobProcessor.  <a href="http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2013/02/custom-jobs-without-job-processor.html">http://justonesandzeros.typepad.com/blog/2013/02/custom-jobs-without-job-processor.html</a>


    For example, your service could reserve 50 jobs at a time, process them all together,
    then mark the 50 jobs as complete.
