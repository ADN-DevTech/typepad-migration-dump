  body: It's not an app, but it would be nice to know what version of Vault a particular
    app, video, concept article, or tips and tricks article applies to.  I am often
    doing a lot of work based on outdated information.

  body: 'The underlying problem is that blogs are good for "current event" style updates,
    but not very good at being an information archive.  What I really need is a Wiki
    for the Vault API.


    Until then, I try to provide "update" sections when articles become obsolete.  If
    I missed something, feel free to drop a comment.'

  body: 'Doug, As non AEC user I''ve singled out 5 apps.

    Some of them are currently 2012 other for 2011.

    If I understand all right then In fact they are all applicable for Vault 2013.
    The only inconvenience - user need to keep all those obsolete client versions
    installed.

    Please consider planing to update "oldest" survey-winners first ... (in order
    not to be tighten to 2011 client only because of couple "down-dated" but required
    Apps).'

  body: 'Well for example, in the Vault 2013 API Help file, if you search for ''thumbnail'',
    you are directed to an article from 2009 with a code example, but the code is
    out of date and generates an exception.


    But in addition, many code examples may run, but use outdated techniques.


    I don''t have a suggestion on how to remedy the situation, but as newer Vault
    versions come out, I can only see it getting worse.


    Maybe a cross index, with each Vault version, and a list of articles that (still)
    apply to that version.
