    What Vault product are you using?

    When exactly does error 160 pop up?  Is it when you click the "OK" button on the
    Configure Recycle Bin dialog?


    The Recycle Bin User Server cannot be "localhost" or "127.0.0.1", but it should
    accept all other values.  What value are you trying to set?'

  body: You were right about the Active Directory user problem.  I had configured
    Recycle Bin to use my own user name and password.  I have since configured it
    to use a Vault user name and password.  Now I'm having a problem where when I
    try to add a file to the recycle bin the GetManafest method is throwing an error
    "Cannot check out now. (MachineName) is currently performing a recycle bin operation."  What
    are some troubleshooting steps to resolve this type of problem?

    For non-admins the Delete command is removed, but not for admins.  If you want
    to remove it from admin too, you would need to edit the source code.


    You can also block deletes using folder security.  So the command will still be
    there, but the operation will fail.'

    I was watching the Webinar and collected all the information about the good/bad
    in the sample application.

    I was wondering if the reroute of the "Deleted Files" to the "Backup Vault" would
    not cure a lot of the problems.


    If the files would be placed in the BackupVault in Folders with a Date and Time
    stamp it would cure the file naming topic.


    Maybe we can have another discussion about tips on the phone during the next weeks
    - Please let me know when I can call you - Thank you'

  body: Yes, that would fix many of the issues, but it would also not be a recycle
    bin at that point.  One feature I liked in both Recycle Bin 1.0 and 2.0 is that
    if you accidentally put something in the bin, you can easily get it back before
    the bin is emptied.

    Quick Question; when review the comments I noticed you stated that it would NOT
    work with active directory users. Is this true. Our current Vault set-up utilizes
    users by active directory/windows accounts. Does this mean we can not use this?

    I have a short question about the version 2.0.2.0 source code package. Where can
    I finde the ReplUtil class? Seems to be missing in the package and I can''t find
