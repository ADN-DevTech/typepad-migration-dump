    For many of us, excellent idea. It will be very helpful if ADMS console could
    give us more logging information for files, custom objects and change orders:
    check in, check out, deleting, renaming, moving, so on.), with time, user, and
    date.


    Waiting for your next post...


    Thanks!'

    This does sound great. Is there a free version of Splunk? It appears as though
    it''s quite expensive. How are you intending on using that? What''s its purpose,
    could you use the same reporting engine Vault & Data Standard uses?


    Cheers


    Scott'
