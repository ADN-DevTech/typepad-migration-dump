  body: '1. I wonder if there any way to save AAF-searches?

    2. Got Error230 on couple cditeries:

    Checked Out By Must be not empty

    Checked Out Must < 21.10.2012

    Seems like there is a problem with dates.

    In fact I''m trying to create a search that returns list of files that are in
    check out for more than a week.'

  body: 'I don''t understand how it works.

    Let say our company policy requires Item to be 10 digits length.

    Let say I''d like to find all that brake policy - I create couple Item-criteries:

    "Number" "May" "<" "??????????"

    "Number" "May" ">" "??????????"

    AAF returnes just all Items...

    What''s wrong with my logic?'

  body: '1.  If you are editing the code, then yes you can add a save/load feature.  The
    easiest way is to use XML Serialization on the SrchCond objects.

    2. I didn''t program in any special handling of date types.  That''s a bug on
    my part.  The correct thing to do is convert the user text to a DateTime object,
    then convert to Universal Time, and then print to the format "MM/dd/yyyy HH:mm:ss".  See
    SrchCond documentation.'

  body: '1. Wrong question/wrong answer. I meant the structure of saved search (standard)
    differs to that used by AAF. So even if somebody would add some saving to AAFmod
    add-in there would be no way to use the result as standard saved search. The only
    way to use it - to load it back to AAFmod, right?

    2. Ok I see.'

  body: 1. The saved search feature uses it's own XML format and doesn't have support
    for OR style searches.  So, no, it can't be used with AAF.
