  body: Development is allowed on Vault Office 2016 client, but you need to stay within
    the Vault Office feature set.  I'm trying to hunt down some "official" documentation
    on this topic.

    Yes, you can develop a plug-in to the Vault Office client.  However, you are supposed
    to limit the functionality to be in-line with the Vault Office features.  You
    can contact Younes Yammouri (younes.yammouri AT autodesk.com) if you have functionality
    questions.


    If you are developing your own EXE that talks to the Vault Server, then your app
    will consume a Workgroup or Professional license.  You can''t write a stand-alone
    app that uses the Vault Office license.'
