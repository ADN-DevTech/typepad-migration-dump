  body: 'Hello Doug,


    first of all I want to pay respect for your create blog. It is very informative
    and helps me along with my work. But I''ve got one question; Is there a possibility
    to change Content Source Properties? e.g. I made a custom tab with different properties
    displayed in it, some are user defined, others are system props. well, changin
    user defined props and updating them isn''t that difficult. But when it comes
    to change the title in a dwg block I fail. Do you have a clue?? I''d be very grateful.


    Best Regards


    Till Klingenberg-Scholle'

  body: 'Hi Doug


    I am not sure if I understand that correctly, could you enlighten me...?


    I create a UDP and assign it to file and item. It shall be a property that the
    user must provide through the Vault Explorer, so there is no Property Provider
    for it. How can I map this UDP to an item UDP...?


    Thanks, Tobias'

  body: 'Let me restate the question to make sure I understand:  You have a UDP associated
    with "FILE" and "ITEM" entity classes.  The UDP has no file or item mappings.  The
    user enters the UDP value on the file, and you want the same value on the UDP
    of the item which is linked to the file.


    That functionality is not supported.  Associating a UDP to "FILE" and "ITEM" just
    means that the property <i>definition</i> can be applied to both items and files.  It
    does not mean that the property <i>values</i> can be mapped.


    Of course, you can fix things up with custom programming.  You can have a utility
    set the item UDP, or the utility can find the file UDP value for a given item.'
