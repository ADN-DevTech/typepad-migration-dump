  body: Be carefull to not use the enum Autodesk.Connectivity.WebServices.SearchOperator
    for SrchOper because values are not the same (SearchOperator.Equals = 1 instead
    of 3).

  body: 'Hello, Doug,

    the API call will not find linked files - true? I mean, if there are some files
    linked into some folder and I then search inside this folder by API, I will not
    find them. In Vault Client they will be found. Are there any options to find them
    via the API call as well?'

  body: Use FindLinksBySearchConditions to search for links.  If you want to find
    Files and Links within a folder, you will need to make 2 API calls, one for Files
    and one for Links.

  body: 'Greetings Doug,

    I am trying to come up with a way to search the vault for all checked out files
    and export the file properties to a csv file so that a separate reporting application
    can pick that up and format individual notifications to users who didn''t check
    their files back in.  I have followed your code samples in the SDK and I am able
    to search the properties of any given drawing and find what I need to determine
    if the file is checked out but what I am not able to do is come up with a way
    to limit what folders I want to search in.  We have thousands of files that have
    no bearing on the search criteria that are being looked at when you use the sample
    code which starts with the root folder.  I am unable to figure out a way to only
    search specific folder and their subfolders by name. Do you have any sample code
    where you can point me to the correct vb.net syntax? I read your article on minimizing
    the number of API calls and I would like to make sure I am using the most optimum
    methods.  I am not sure how this list works so my direct email and how I will
    see a response so my direct email is djdros@derrickcorp.com'
