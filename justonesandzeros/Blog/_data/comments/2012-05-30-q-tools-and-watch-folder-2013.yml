  body: Doug, could you give any advice for those whos Q-tools service never starts
    automatically even so has "Automatic" Start type. Starting manually works fine.

  body: Hi Doug, Sorry to bother so close to AU. But is it possible to specify that
    an email be sent to the user who submitted the job, rather than a static list?
    Through the settings.xml file?

  body: No QTools doesn't do that, but it's a great idea.  Maybe I'll get that in
