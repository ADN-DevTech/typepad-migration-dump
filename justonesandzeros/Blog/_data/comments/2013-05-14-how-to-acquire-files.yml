  body: You are referring to .idw files on an Inventor assembly?  Yes you can download
    those as part of the assembly download.  One of the various AcquireFilesSettings
    allows you to specify the FileRelationshipGatheringSettings.  If IncludeRelatedDocumentation
    is set to true, it should download the drawing files.

    love the examples.

    Is it possible to check out the entire assembly with this method. My code will
    download iam, ipt and idw files but if i use the checkout option it only checks
    out the iam file.

  body: 'Hi doug


    Got back onto this after I had decided to use the downloaddialogue method for
    awhile. What I would like to do is to determine the files that will be wrapped
    up with the acquirefiles prior to actually downloading/checking them out. The
    reason is we would like to change the state of the corresponding files back to
    "draft" before they are checked out by the user. I cant do it after the case because
    it wont let me change the state when the files are checked-out. I was hoping the
    "noaction" option may stil provide a result list that i could use to pre-process
    the files and change their state. Any suggestions.'

  body: 'Offhand, I don''t have any sample code for you.  In general, I suggest not
    making any updates within an event.  The reason is that your actions may affect
    the operation in progress.  It''s like trying to fix a table while standing on
    the table.


    Here is the order of operations that I suggest:

    1. Run AcquireFiles in noAction mode

    2. In your event handler, read all the files being updated and store them in a
    list.

    3. AcquireFiles exists

    4. Go through your list and perform the needed operations.

    5. Run AcquireFiles again to check out the files.  No event handlers are needed
    this time.'

    would be acquired prior to acyually doing it. Everytime i tried it i would get
    no acquireResults back so I gave up and have resorted to the getLatestAssociatedFileePathsByMasterIds
    method.

    Instead of creating a new UserPasswordCredentials object, you create a new WinAuthCredentials
    object.  After that,everything is the same.  You pass the credentials object into
    the constructor for WebServiceManager.


    The code would look something like this...

    UserPasswordCredentials cred = new UserPasswordCredentials("theServer", "theVault");

    WebServiceManager mgr = new WebServiceManager(cred);



    For Vault 2014 and later...

    For a non UI login, use Autodesk.DataManagement.Client.Framework.Vault.Library.ConnectionManager.LogIn(..)

    To prompt the user to login, use

    Autodesk.DataManagement.Client.Framework.Vault.Forms.LogIn(..)'

    FileIteration.


    Call FileService.GetLatestFilesByIterationIds to get the latest version of the
    file and use that to start the download.


    If that''s not the solution to your problem, then I suggest posting to the Vault
    Customization group.  That way it''s easier for you to post sample code, screen
    shots, etc.
