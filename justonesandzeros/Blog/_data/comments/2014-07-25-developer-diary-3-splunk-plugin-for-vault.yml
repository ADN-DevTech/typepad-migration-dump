  body: 'Anyway good try, Doug!


    Are you going to try more?


    As for me the most obvious way is to add advanced logging functionality in next
    releases (as SP or SR, for example) within ADMS - not outside of it. I think you
    have the ability to convey this idea to your PMs.


    As both we know, outside logging is quite simple and works correct just with Vault
    Explorer, not with third-party solutions.

  body: I agree.  The ideal solution is for Vault to have better logging capabilities.  I
    don't think there is much more that can be done through an app.

  body: Is there any other way for Vault administrators/users to speed-up adding of
    this feature to next release, instead of kudoing "Activity Logs" at Idea Station
    (<a href="http://goo.gl/QgnOaZ)">http://goo.gl/QgnOaZ)</a> ?
