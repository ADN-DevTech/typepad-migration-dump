  body: "Thanks for your post. First point is about the documentation. Your suggestion\

    \ process and we need the information from File BOM. This is because we are coping\
    \ existing structure from vault and create new one. In that case we need file\
    \ BOM to assign proper item together for files. Do you have some hint for this\
    \ case?\n\nRegards,\nPawel J."

    be a feature.

  body: "Its a glaring omission in my opinion. As a result of having no lifecycle\

    \ Released & WIP items. I understand the Web Client only displays Released Items,\
    \ but the Web Client sucks to navigate around & isn't customisable. \n\nThe result\
    \ is an unsecure Item environment. Rather odd if you ask me."

  body: 'Hi Doug,


    Regarding this, can we imagine to export the BOM of an assembly trough Vault API
    in order to send this to ERP (without using items)?


    I have a customer who want to use file lifecycle but don''t want to use item only
    for sending this to ERP (too complicate).


    Thanks in advance.'

  body: 'If you want to use it that way, then you can do that.  But it''s not the
    recommended approach, so there is extra risk on your part.


    For example, it''s possible for two drawings to reference the same part.  The
    Vault Item framework detects and handles these cases.  If you work with file BOMs
    directly, you are going to have a hard time detecting these cases.'

  body: 'Dear Doug,

    is it possible to use a custom object as a manufacturing order:

    example i want to manufacture 3 times item1 and 7 times item2, and be able to
    track manufacturing in vault.


    before plunging in programing:


    is it possible to create a command in which i say i want 3 of this item1 and 7
    item 2 for a certain project, after that it creates multiple custom objects (manufacturing
    order). Each custom object, represents a part to be manufactured, it has properties
    to track manufactured quantities (required BOM quantity, manufactured quantity,
    remaining quantity), and is it possible to create a tab for this object showing
    the drawing of this part from the item?


    Thanks in advance'

  body: 'Yes, I think you can use Custom Objects to represent a manufacturing order.


    You can make a custom command that creates Custom Objects based on the items that
    the user selects.  The Custom Object can either contain copied data from the items.
    Or you can link the Custom Object to the items. Or both.


    You can create tabs for Custom Objects but the Vault API doesn''t give you anything
    for displaying CAD data.  You would have to plug-in a viewer.'

    understand the design enough.  You need AutoCAD Mechanical or AutoCAD Electrical
    if you want BOM information.


    Vault still lets you run "Assign Item" on a file with no BOM.  In this case Vault
    creates a default BOM of just a single Item.
