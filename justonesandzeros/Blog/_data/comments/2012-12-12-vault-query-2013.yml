    If you allow, I''d like to offer some tricks about Vault 2014 compatability, while
    there is no new Vault Query version:

    1. You can easy connect to Vault Server 2014 with Vault Query 2013.

    2. You can play around with new Vault API, just updating following dll''s with
    same ones from Vault 2014:

    <ul>Autodesk.Connectivity.WebServices.dll

    Autodesk.Connectivity.Extensibility.Framework.dll</ul>

    You can find this files in "SDK/bin" folder.
