  body: 'Hi,


    GoToLocation works but I wonder about the following:

    Is it possible to call CommandItem.Execute method by code?


    So I can use the GoToLocation at any time I want (also OnLogOn event).'

  body: Sorry, but you cant call GoToLocation whenever you want.  It won't work during
    events like LogOn or LogOff.  It also won't work inside of a custom tab.

    I hoped to store a session state at OnlogOff and jump to the last location OnLogOn.
    But all this will need to work by CommandItems(Buttons).


    I see I can''t use GoToLocation for SelectionTypeId.FileVersion and SelectionTypeId.Bom
    because there is no fullname for it.'

  body: "GoToLocation only works after your command exits the Execute function.  \n\
    \nSo if you want to navigate while keeping your dialog open, then the answer is\
    \ no.  But if you want to close your dialog before navigating, then the answer\
    \ is yes.\n\nThere are some sample apps that use GoToLocation and a custom dialog:\

    The preferred behavior is that you go to the object the link points to, and not
    go to the link itself.
