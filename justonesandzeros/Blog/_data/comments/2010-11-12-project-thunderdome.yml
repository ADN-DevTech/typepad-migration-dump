  body: 'Hi Doug,

    I think this is a very good example on how to deploy default settings. I was thinking
    of extending this to also deploy the CAD standards with it. Is it possible to
    impersonate another Windows user to have the deployed

    "EXTENSIONS" or "CAD STANDARDS" out of editing possibilities of the regular users
    ?'

    I''ve used this app at all my Vault 2012 implementations, and find it very useful.
    Would be great if you could migrate it to 2012! What do you say :)?

    won''t have time to get to it until May, at the earliest.


    If you don''t want to wait that long, you, or somebody that knows how to program,
    can download the source code and build an updated version.
