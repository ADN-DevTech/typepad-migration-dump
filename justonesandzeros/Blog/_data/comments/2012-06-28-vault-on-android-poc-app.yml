  body: How about displaying the list of change orders requiring my input along with
    some basic information associate to the change order?  Perhaps develop it further

    IF "saved searches" were stored with the Vault user in the DB, THEN it would be
    great if the app just ran them. You could make any query you wanted and run them
    from anywhere in the company.


    Instead, you could create saved searches in the app and run them on demand.'
