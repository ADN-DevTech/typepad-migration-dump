  body: Stunning!! Can you get it to generate a row per quantity now?? So if there
    are Qty 3 components, you can get it to report 3 line items? I've wanted to use
    Vault to generate component labels with barcodes for a long time. I'm really hoping
    this change supports that.

  body: '2015 R2 has a "grouping" feature that lets you show multiple rows for different
    instances of the same part.  If you can see that in the BOM view, then the BOM
    Report should be able to give you the same view.


    If you want a BOM Report that looks different than what you see in Vault Explorer,
    then this app will not do that.  However, the source code is available, as usual.  So
    you can program your own type of BOM view.'

  body: Excellent. Thanks Doug. In think it will need to be different because the
    grouping is fixed to match the grouping in the inventor BOM I believe. I didn't
    realize they could be different via the API.

  body: "Hi Doug\n Is this BOM Generation is same as inventor API BOM Export to CSV\
    \ file using following call.\n\n var bom = assemblyDoc.ComponentDefinition.BOM;\n\
    bom.BOMViews[\"Structured\"].Export(csvFilePath, FileFormatEnum.kTextFileCommaDelimitedFormat);\n\
    \ncan we use vault API for generating BOM and exporting it to csv.\nthanks"

  body: 'Hi Doug,


    I am trying to get this sample to work in 2016. The JobExtension class contains
    a function ''ReadBOMData'' that uses a web method ''GetLastestItemInRevisionByItemId''.
    This method doesn''t seem to be available in 2016 anymore and the API help doesn''t
    give information about the 2016 equivalent. Which method should be used in 2016?'

    would be my guess."


    If that doesn''t work, I suggest logging an ADN ticket.  Sorry about that.
