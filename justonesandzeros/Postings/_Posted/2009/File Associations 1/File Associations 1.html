<b>File Associations: Part 1</b><br>
Welcome to part 1 in my 2 part series on file associations.&nbsp; This
post will focus only on the associations seen in the base version of
Vault.&nbsp; The next post will go over Vault Workgroup concepts like
revisions and lifecycle states.<br>
<br>
<b>Introduction:</b><br>
For base vault we have 2 concepts that are simple on their own, but
start to get complex when you mix them together.&nbsp; <br>
The first concept is <b>File Versions</b>.&nbsp; Every time you edit a
file, you get a new version. Simple.<br>
The second concept is <b>File Associations</b>. &nbsp; Files can be
linked to each other in a parent/child relationship.&nbsp; This allows
you to create dependency trees.&nbsp; Again, simple.<br>
<br>
Now lets mix the concepts together.&nbsp; A file association is
between one <b>version </b>of a file and another.&nbsp; This means
that the
depencency tree might change for each version of a file.<br>

<br>
Here is where the confusion starts.&nbsp; You have a big chunk of data
and multiple ways of traversing the data.&nbsp; The good news is that
the API has some built in tools to help you.<br>
<br>
<b>Example:</b><br>
Let's go through a simple example.&nbsp; First we upload 2 new files, A
and B.&nbsp; A is the parent of B.&nbsp; This is what things look like
in Vault.<br>
<img alt="" src="images/Figure2.png" height="89" width="195"><br>
<br>
Next we will check out B and check it back in with a new file, C.&nbsp;
B is the parent of C.&nbsp; Our view now looks like this.<br>
<img alt="" src="images/Figure3.png" height="129" width="388"><br>
<br>
If we start at A and want to get the entire depenency tree, base Vault
gives you 2 two types of traversals:<br>
<ul>
  <li><b>Snapshot in time</b>:&nbsp; You want to view the tree exactly
as it looked when it was uploaded.&nbsp; <b>GetFileAssociationsByIds</b>
in the Document Service is that function that will give you this
view.&nbsp; If you started with file A and wanted all children, you
would get this view:<br>
    <img alt="" src="images/Figure2.png" height="89" width="195"><br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><b>Get latest</b>:&nbsp; You want to get the most recent version
of all the files involved.&nbsp; <b>GetLatestFileAssociationsByMasterIds</b>
in the Document Service is the function that will give you this
view.&nbsp; If you started with file A and wanted all children, you
would get this view:<br>
    <img alt="" src="images/Figure4.png" height="135" width="257"><br>
  </li>
</ul>
<br>
That's all you need to know for base Vault.&nbsp; My next post will go
over the Revision and Lifecycle concepts and how they relate to file
associations.<br>
