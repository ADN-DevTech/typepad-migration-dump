DRAWING COMPARE

SUMMARY
-------
Compare two drawings in Vault.  The drawings must have 2D DWF visualization files.


USAGE
-----
The Drawing Compare command is available from context menu. It's possible to select following inputs:
- two different file versions on History tab
- one or two files in file list

It's possible to refine selection of file revision in the dialog. Use Compare button to create comparison drawing.

By default, the utility compares differences between revisions.  However if you select two files from the History tab, it will compare those two versions, regardless of revision.
